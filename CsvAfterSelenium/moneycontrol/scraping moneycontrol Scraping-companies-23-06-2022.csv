0,What’s good for India is good for HUL: Chairman Nitin Paranjpe at 89th AGM,companies," Nitin Paranjpe, the chairman of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on June 23 outlined the company’s goals going forward in India and stressed on the need for equitable and inclusive growth in India that is both productivity and employment led. “HUL has been an integral part of India’s growth story over the years and has always believed that what is good for India is good for the company,” he said addressing the shareholders at HUL 89th Annual General Meet (AGM). This was Paranjpe’s first AGM after taking over as the chairman of the company. As its parent Unilever undergoes major restructuring, HUL in February separated the positions of chairman of the board and the CEO and managing director of the company and appointed Nitin Paranjpe as its non-executive chairman and non-executive director, effective March 31. The company’s erstwhile chairman Sanjiv Mehta continues to serve as the CEO and MD of the company. The India opportunity Paranjpe’s speech titled ‘serving India today and tomorrow’ addressed the challenges of inequality of wealth, and poverty and said the India growth story needs to be built by transforming rural India, accelerating the growth of medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), building strong infrastructure, creating a competitive edge in manufacturing, ensuring women’s participation in the workforce and deft management of the environment. “One of the biggest drivers will be the transformation of rural India. Today, nearly 60 percent of the country’s population depends on agriculture, and yet, agriculture and allied sectors only contribute about 19 percent to the country’s GDP,” Paranjpe said. According to the chairman, agriculture needs productivity-led growth, so that the sector can contribute significantly by improving output. “Hypothetically, we need to aim for 30 percent of those engaged in agriculture to produce what 60 percent or more do today.” Paranjpe also stressed that the country needs to ensure that there are ample employment opportunities in other sectors to phase people out of agriculture. The chairman similarly outlined the potential of MSMEs in driving further growth in India not only supplementing the country’s GDP, but by also providing for one of the highest employment to turnover ratios. He further lauded government initiatives to create India as a manufacturing hub and strengthening the infrastructure in the country. “Initiatives such as ‘Housing for All’, ‘Smart Cities Mission’; setting up of the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development and the Rs 100 lakh crore master plan for multi-modal connectivity are all steps in the right direction,” he added. However, he added, the country needs to address gender gap in the society to meet its full economic potential. “A McKinsey study estimates that India has the highest relative potential for additional GDP growth from achieving gender equality – as much as $700 billion. However, in the current scenario, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), India has one of the highest gender gaps with less than 20 percent women participation in the labour force. We have a long way to go to meet the global average of over 45 percent,” Paranjpe said addressing the shareholders. Maintaining ecological balance and next generation policy reforms like GST and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code were other important measures shared by Paranjpe to drive growth in the country. HUL’s gameplan for India Paranjpe said HUL will continue on its mission to serve India going ahead as the company recognises that it is the role of business to not just create economic value but also to generate social value, and to do so in a sustainable way. “With more than 9 out of 10 Indian households using one or more of our brands, we realise that we have the power to impact the lives of our consumers,” he added. According to the chairman, through several initiatives, HUL has been addressing challenges like water scarcity, livelihood opportunities, employability, health and sanitation among others. The company will continue to serve India, however Paranjpe added, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic on the country. “For instance, people are now demanding products that not only deliver functional benefits but are also good for the planet and for people. Forecasters are predicting a new `green awakening’ and increased `climate literacy’ among consumers especially after the fragility of the planet was exposed during the pandemic,” he said. Paranjpe outlined the need to tap digital as well as the offline medium as consumers shop across channels. “Brands need to be present everywhere and communicate consistently to stay top of mind. But that’s not all. In a nation of paradoxes, critical to unlocking value is de-averaging – we will need to win in rural as well as urban, in mass as well as premium, in traditional as well as digital,” he added. As HUL tries to leverage the India opportunity, the company is striving to build an intelligent enterprise, focusing on environmental sustainability build more resilient and equitable communities by raising living standards. He highlighted initiatives such Shikhar, the company’s B2B app which helps retailers track and place orders and now reaches over 8 lakh outlets and its tech-driven Dapada manufacturing unit that became the first FMCG factory in India to join the World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network. Paranjpe also reaffirmed HUL’s resolve to achieve net-zero emissions for all its products from sourcing to point of sale by 2039. “We have eliminated CO emissions from 2 thermal energy in our operations by replacing coal with greener alternatives such as biomass and biodiesel. By 2030, we will move away from fossil fuel-derived chemicals in our cleaning and laundry products, unlocking new ways of reducing our carbon footprint,” he added. In conclusion, he said HUL will continue to serve its consumers by leveraging technology across the value chain while taking care of people and the planet."

3,Clouds over steel stocks have darkened,companies," Iron ore prices are sending a signal that distress may lie ahead for the steel sector. The industry outlook had already dulled in 2022 due to a series of setbacks, including rising energy costs, China’s real estate slowdown, the Russia-Ukraine war’s impact on demand and central banks hitting the brakes on easy monetary policy, a course correction that will slow the world economy.
But all of this was already known. In fact, in India, matters had turned worse after the government imposed..."

5,Uber is said to have explored a sale of Indian ride-hailing arm,companies," Uber Technologies Inc. explored options for its Indian ride-hailing business, including a sale, but suspended discussions after tech startup valuations cratered, people familiar with the matter said. The US company began weighing alternatives and reached out to several interested parties after recognizing it had limited potential for profitable expansion in the country, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. It pondered a stock swap with local companies or even a pullout, before a global equity market rout upended plans, the people added. A stock deal was favored in exploratory talks as that would allow Uber to retain a foothold in India, the people said. Uber and its local-rival Ola had been struggling to eke out a profit in a rapidly growing but price-sensitive market, where constant driver attrition was pressuring margins. A sale to a local operator could have mirrored similar deals it struck with Didi Global Inc. in China and Grab Holdings Ltd. in Southeast Asia, where Uber ceded the markets but kept an equity stake in the dominant local player to tap future growth. The maneuvers ended costly turf wars waged with driver incentives and cash subsidies. Uber disputed the idea it had considered retreating from India. “Bloomberg’s reporting is categorically false. We have never explored exiting India — not even for a minute,” company spokesperson Ruchica Tomar said in an emailed statement. Uber remains committed to India and continues to hire people “aggressively.” Uber, whose shares have gyrated wildly since its 2019 IPO, has hived off money-losing businesses to achieve its goal of being consistently profitable. In May, it delivered a positive outlook for earnings, signaling the company plans to capitalize on robust ride demand without compromising profits by focusing on product changes, rather than incentives, to address a driver shortage. India and Japan are the sole major remaining Asian markets for Uber, which has scaled back sharply since the tumultuous days of former chief Travis Kalanick. The San Franciso-based company started services in India in 2013 and now offers ride-hailing in almost 100 cities across the country, its website showed. Conversations around an India deal had been preliminary and the company could decide not to revisit those options, the people said."
6,"Vodafone Idea defers Rs 8,837 crore AGR dues payment, gets option to pay interest via equity",companies," Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea has decided to defer payment of additional adjusted gross revenues of Rs 8,837 crore dues by a period of four years. The company in a late night filing on June 22, said that the DoT on June 15, has raised adjusted gross revenue (AGR) demand for additional two financial years beyond 2016-17, which were not covered under the Supreme court order on the statutory dues. Vodafone Idea (VIL) in the filing said that its board of directors ""has approved the exercise of the option of deferment of the AGR related dues by a period of four years with immediate effect, in accordance with the said DoT Letter. The amount of the AGR related dues as stated in the said DoT Letter is Rs 8,837 crores which is subject to revision on account of disposal of various representations"". The government calculates its share of revenue from telecom operators based on their AGR, which is considered to have been earned by them from the sale of services. VIL filing said that the DoT has offered the company a moratorium of four years for all AGR related dues up to Financial Year 2018-19, which were not included in Supreme Court order dated September 1, 2022 which can be exercised within a period of 15 days by June 30. ""The said DoT Letter also provides the Company an option for equity conversion of interest dues upfront for these AGR related dues for which a period of 90 days has been provided from the date of the said DoT Letter,"" VIL said. The company said the fresh demand of Rs 8,837 crore is subject to revision on account of disposal of various representations, CAG, special audit and any other outcome of litigation and ""the final amount to be paid in six equal annual instalments post moratorium period starting from March 31, 2026"". The government has already approved Vodafone Idea's proposal to convert about Rs 16,000 crore interest payment dues of previous AGR moratorium into around 33 per cent stake in the company. According to official data, telecom operators owe over Rs 1.65 lakh crore to the government in adjusted gross revenue up to financial year 2018-19. The fresh calculation shows AGR liability on Bharti Airtel was Rs 31,280 crore, Vodafone Idea Rs 59,236.63 crore, Reliance Jio Rs 631 crore, BSNL Rs 16,224 crore, MTNL Rs 5,009.1 crore up to financial year 2018-19. The company in a separate filing said that its board has approved raising of Rs 436.21 crore from Vodafone Group company Euro Pacific Securities through issue of preferential share at a unit price of Rs 10.2 apiece or warrants at the same price."
7,"Tata Steel plans low CO2 steel-making technologies in UK, Netherlands",companies," Tata Steel is working on a plan for transition to low carbon technologies for making steel in the UK and the Netherlands. In October 2021, Tata Steel completed the process of separating Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands as two independent companies from Tata Steel Europe. Both, Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands have been developing detailed plans for transition to low CO2 technologies in line with the company's goal to produce CO2-neutral steel by 2050 in Europe, company's CEO & MD T V Narendran and Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee said. ""In Tata Steel Netherlands, we plan to gradually phase out our blast furnaces and coal over the next 10 years by replacing them with a combination of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) technology based on hydrogen, and electric furnaces,"" the executives said in the company's annual report for 2021-22. In the Netherlands, the company has a capacity of 7 MTPA. According to the company, Tata Steel UK also produces steel through blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnace routes, and has an annual capacity of 5 million tonne per annum (MTPA).

10,"Telcos may buy spectrum worth Rs 71,000 crore in 5G auction: IIFL",companies," The three private telecom operators -- Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea -- are expected to buy spectrum worth Rs 71,000 crore in the upcoming auction, leaving a vast majority of the radiowaves going under the hammer unsold, according to research firm IIFL Securities. The government will next month auction about Rs 4.3 lakh crore worth of airwaves capable of offering fifth-generation or 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet. According to the report released on Wednesday, the government's in-principle nod to allocate spectrum directly to enterprises is going to have an adverse outcome of the mega auction. ""While supply is abundant, the government has not cut TRAI's proposed reserve prices despite telcos' assertion that these were still high. We see telcos bidding only for 4 of the 10 bands and spectrum should be sold at base price. We estimate spectrum outlay of Rs 37500 crore, Rs 25000 crore and Rs 8500 crore for Jio, Bharti and Vi,"" IIFL said. The research firm further said if all telecom operators avail the option of equal annual installments over 20 years, the government would receive Rs 6,200 proceeds in the current financial year. It said telcos may give the premium 700 MHz band spectrum a miss as they await further reserve-price cuts. Jio and Bharti may bolster their sub-1 GHz holdings by bidding for the 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands, respectively. ""We do not assume any bids in the 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands. Bids for 3.6 GHz are somewhat tricky to predict,"" it said. The report further said telcos could bid for small quantities in the 3.6 GHz and 28 GHz bandd -- seen as the prime radiowaves for 5G technology -- as it can lead to large savings in spectrum usage charges."

13,How ASICS is targeting small-town India,companies," Japanese sportswear brand ASICS, one of the recent entrants to the segment in the country as compared to Puma and Nike which have been in the Indian market since the early 2000s, is making inroads into small towns of the country and launching stores. “About 30-35 percent of sales on our website comes from small towns; this indicates a strong demand for our products in these cities and hence we have opened several stores in the small towns over the last two years,” Rajat Khurana, Managing Director ASICS India and South Asia. ASICS currently has 75 stores in the country out of which 20 are located in tier-II and beyond towns. Going ahead, the company plans to take its total store count to 100 in the country, and of the 25 new stores about half will be opened in smaller towns. The small-town stores, however, contribute only 15 percent to its overall turnover. According to Khurana, the low contribution to the revenue from these towns is because the average price points being sold in these towns are lower than that of metros. “Our average selling price in Delhi or Mumbai is Rs 9,000 but in tier-II and beyond cities it is Rs 6,000-6,500,” said Khurana. To cater to the consumers in these towns, the company has tweaked its inventory strategy, and while its entry price point in metros stands at Rs 5,499-6,000, in small towns the entry-level products are priced at Rs 3,499. The company also does not stock products at higher price points (such as those priced at Rs 22,000) at these stores. ASICS’ marketing strategy is also different for these towns and while it taps mediums like digital advertising and partners with marathons in larger cities, in small towns, it ties up with running clubs and relies on outdoor advertising to target consumers. Digital focus ASICS India has also seen an uptick in sales from e-commerce in India and is targeting 50 percent sales from the channel going ahead. According to Khurana, the company’s online sales picked up significantly during the pandemic and now contribute about 35-40 percent of its sales. It also aims to draw about 50 percent of its sales from online channels such as e-commerce marketplaces and its website. The company used to draw about 25 percent of its sales from the channel in the pre-pandemic period. However, movement curbs during the pandemic led to a rise in the sales from e-commerce and the channel now contributes 35-40 percent of its sales, said Khurana. “Our journey during these months changed and we started exploring how we can attract young customers to the digital channels,” he added. To offer the consumers a similar experience as its stores, ASICS also categorises shoes on its platform and e-commerce marketplaces based on the pronation type. Store revamp In its latest initiative, ASICS has started revamping its stores to make them more sustainable and digitised. The company on June 22 reopened its refurbished store in Gurugram. “Globally ASICS has revamped its stores to make them more digitised and sustainable and we want to offer a similar experience to the Indian consumers too,” said Khurana. The company will be next refurbishing its store in Select City Walk in Mumbai and then two other stores in Mumbai. The rest of its old stores will follow suit soon. The news stores by the company will also be in this format. ASICS’ new store format has digital touch points throughout the stores and includes screens above the footwear walls, screens within running services, and screens behind the cash desk, as well as a digital POS. The store also uses sustainable items such as FSC-certified timbers, recycled and recyclable materials, and energy-efficient lighting (such as LED) to reduce carbon emissions related to its operations."
14,TCS bags deal from Aadhar Housing Finance to improve business operations,companies," India’s largest software firm TCS has bagged a deal to drive business process transformation at Aadhar Housing Finance for an undisclosed sum, the companies said on Wednesday. The domestic housing financier will be deploying the Tata group company’s lending and securitisation platform for market expansion, according to a statement. The partnership with TCS is for an end-to-end business process transformation using the integrated and collaborative blockchain-based cloud platform.

Globally, banking, financial services and insurance is the biggest segment for the company."
15,Labour codes: India Inc expects impact on P&L; employee experience top influencer of benefit strategy,companies," At least 64 percent of companies in India are expecting a visible impact on their profit and loss (P&L) as a result of the anticipated changes in the four labour codes, a new survey by global advisory firm Willis Towers Watson (WTW) said on June 22. In light of the possible changes via the labour reforms and increasing cost of providing retirement benefits, WTW said 53 percent of organisations in India are considering or have planned to review their retirement or long-term benefits design in the next two years. The survey that captured information from more than 70 companies underlined that employee experience (49 percent) is the top influencer of long-term employee benefits strategy, followed by regulatory complexity (45 percent), WTW said. India has consolidated 29 central labour laws into four codes on wages, social security, occupational health, and industrial relations. While the parliament approved the Code on Wages in August 2019, the rest three were passed in September 2020. But none of them has been rolled out as yet. The labour codes are expected to introduce far-reaching changes with implications for employers and workers. They will offer greater flexibility in rolling out short-term work contracts, make hiring and firing flexible, and make industrial strikes harder. A change in the definition of wages may impact the take-home amount but will increase retirement savings – something that some entrepreneurs and employers oppose because it could increase their employee cost in the short term. On labour codes, the survey further said that at least 71 percent of companies have taken some action to assess implications. In contrast, 34 percent are unsure of making changes to their compensation structure in response to the new definition of wages, while 23 percent are planning to include variable pay in the wage definition. “Organisations are gradually coming out of the pandemic survival mode and focusing on issues such as the long-term implications of retirement adequacy and employee benefits. Our study shows that the retirement benefit landscape in India is evolving, with organisations retaining superannuation as an option in addition to promoting NPS,” said Ritobrata Sarkar, Head of Retirement, WTW India. “While both these avenues co-exist, it will be critical for organisations to consider the regulatory environment, flexibility for employees, cost-benefit analysis and most importantly, employee experience as they review their long-term employee benefits strategy and mix. That said, NPS continues to be a focus area with a large majority exploring strategies to increase employee participation rates,” Sarkar added. On NPS, the study said 73 percent of the surveyed companies are currently providing or planning to implement corporate NPS, and amongst those that already provide, 61 percent are exploring strategies to increase the participation rate."
16,Emami Realty aims at 50% sales growth in FY23,companies," Emami Realty has projected that real estate demand will remain robust despite economic headwinds, and is aiming at a 50 per cent jump in sales to Rs 750 crore in the current fiscal, a top company official said on Wednesday. The real estate arm of the diversified Emami Group has targeted retiring its long-term debt by 2023-24, which is now pegged at Rs 118 crore, he said. The developer, which has a land bank of around 2,500 acres in 7-8 cities in the country, will leverage the resource for new projects and explore monetisation of a part of it in the next few years. ''Economic headwinds, high commodity prices and other associated costs affected us by around 20 per cent. Despite all these, robust demand will continue and help overcome the challenges. “We are expecting a topline of Rs 750 crore in the current fiscal from the standalone operations as against nearly Rs 500 crore sales achieved in FY'22,'' Emami Realty MD and CEO Nitesh Kumar told PTI in a telephonic interview. The total revenue from projects, including joint venture ones, is pegged at Rs 1,180 crore during the fiscal. The combined revenue in FY22 was Rs 950 crore, registering an 85 per cent year-on-year growth. After the introduction of real estate regulations, home buyers have been switching to organised real estate companies, he said, adding that such a trend helps these firms maintain strong sales. Various supports from state governments to the sector have also helped bolster demand, he said. ''Reputation we earned over the years by our consistent performance and the ability to keep promises to our customers have translated into phenomenal results,'' he said. During the current financial year, the company also plans to launch new projects worth Rs 1,000 crore. Last year, Emami unveiled projects worth Rs 700 crore. These include a 100-acre integrated township project at Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, Aerocity in Coimbatore on 62 acres of land, Astha, an eco-living project, in Kolkata on 40 acres and an office building at the IT hub in Salt Lake and 20 lakh sq-ft housing projects in Mumbai. Kumar also said, ''The debt level of the company had been reduced to Rs 118 crore as of March 2022 from Rs 264 crore with a strong cash flow. We are aiming at retiring the entire long-term loan outstanding by 2023-24. Only short-term operational debt will continue depending on projects.'' ''Our land bank of 2,500 acres in eight cities is huge and it will be good enough for the next 7-8 years’ growth plans. We will also evaluate monetising some land parcels,'' he said. Speaking about the Kolkata market, he said, ''We are bullish on the growth prospects in the city, driven by infrastructure development and policy incentives by the West Bengal government.'' Emami Realty Ltd has so far successfully delivered more than 24 residential and commercial projects, comprising a 36 million sqft area, primarily in Kolkata."
17,Varun Beverages' Jaipuria settles insider trading case with Sebi; pays Rs 56 lakh,companies," Varun Beverages chairman Ravi Kant Jaipuria has settled with capital markets regulator Sebi a case related to alleged violations of insider trading rules after paying nearly Rs 56 lakh towards settlement charges. It was alleged that Jaipuria had communicated unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) relating to a strategic partnership between Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL) and PepsiCo for selling and distribution of the larger Tropicana to two persons. Based on the information, shares of Varun Beverages, PepsiCo India's bottling partner, were traded. The latest order came after Jaipuria approached Sebi to settle the proceedings initiated against him for the alleged violation ""without admitting or denying the finding"". ""This settlement order disposes of the aforesaid adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant viz. Ravi Kant Jaipuria vide SCN... dated December 21, 2021,"" Sebi said in its order passed on Tuesday. In its order, the regulator observed that two entities -- Spank Management Services and Fenton Investment -- traded in the scrip of VBL during the UPSI period from December 21, 2017, to January 4, 2018. Both of these entities through their directors or owners were connected to Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd in which Jaipuria was also a director. As per the annual report of Lemon Tree Hotels for the FY2017-18, it was observed that Patanjali Govind Keswani was the chairman and managing director of Lemon Tree Hotels. Further, Jaipuria was the director and Arvind Singhania was an independent director in Lemon Tree Hotels. On analysing the annual return for the year 2016-17 filled by the Spank at MCA, it was observed that Lemon Tree Hotels was one of the associate companies of Spank. Further, Jaipuria, Keswani and Singhania were known to each other personally. Jaipuria and Keswani -- during the period December 27, 2017, to January 2, 2018 -- were staying in the same hotel in Bangkok. During the same period, Singhania was also staying in Bangkok in a hotel which was nearby. It was noted that Fenton (Singhania) and Spank (Keswani) had placed an order to buy shares of VBL and sold all these shares immediately after an announcement related to the strategic partnership was made public. The orders were placed by Fenton (Singhania) and Spank (Keswani) on December 28, 2017, and January 2, 2018, respectively, when all three of them were in Bangkok and Jaipuria was in possession of the UPSI.

18,"IKEA’s Bengaluru store, its fourth in India, aims to source 50% of products locally",companies," Four years after entering India, Swedish furniture retailer IKEA has launched its fourth store, in Nagasandra, Bengaluru. The new store is its biggest in India, covering an  area of 460,000 sq ft. At the store’s launch event, Suzanne Pulverer, CEO of IKEA India, told Moneycontrol that the retailer is seeing an impact from rising inflation and to combat it, will be focusing more on local sourcing to make products affordable. “Everyone is impacted by what has happened in the world with the pandemic, and then we have disruptions because everything is connected. So yes, we are seeing a lot of pressure, on prices, on costs… We are trying to absorb and we are also adjusting our prices so that we can keep the balance between  affordability and margins,” said Pulverer. 27% of the Bengaluru store’s 7,000 types of products are produced in India and it currently employs around 1,000 people. IKEA will continue hiring more local talent in the coming months. During the launch, IKEA’s top management highlighted that the Bengaluru store is different from its other stores. It has balcony furnishings, a large children’s play area called ‘Småland’, and a 1,000-seater restaurant with a mix of Swedish and Indian food.

Commenting on over a quarter of the Bengaluru store’s products being sourced locally, Pulverer said: “The textile part has always been very strong in India — corporate and home furnishing accessories. So, now we are expanding the categories contributing to partners developing the industry, we are sourcing it here. Gradually, we want to increase the local sourcing, long term, up to 50%.” The retailer will be investing Rs 3,000 crore in Karnataka. Commenting on this, Pulverer said that the store is IKEA’s first investment. She added: “We will look at how we can open more customer meeting points, maybe smaller formats. So, all can go under this Rs 3,000 crore investment that we have committed.”"

22,From China to Chennai? Taiwanese tech manufacturer Foxconn looks to cranking out electric cars in India ,companies," Taiwanese Apple Inc supplier and tech contract manufacturer Foxconn wants to make electric vehicles (EVs) in India as part of a plan to diversify the supply chain beyond China. Foxconn's EV venture - Foxtron - is considering setting up a centre in India and other destinations in South Asia such as Vietnam and Indonesia, the Economic Times reported on June 22 citing unnamed sources. Foxconn's subsidiary - Bharat FIH - currently operates two units in Tamil Nadu's Sriperumbudur on the outskirts of Chennai that manufacture Apple iPhones and Xiaomi phones among others. According to the report, the Foxconn group has shown interest in manufacturing products other than phones for clients and itself. Tamil Nadu is looking to woo the conglomerate to further invest in the state, the sources said. Moneycontrol could not verify the report. Foxconn is also studying India's automobile space and gauging potential demand in the EV space. In 2021, it acquired a facility in North America to develop EVs where it will manufacture products for hybrid EV brand Fisker. Earlier this month, Bharat FIH received approval from the capital markets regulator for an initial public offering (IPO)."
23,Bear Market Woes: 83% of Nifty 500 stocks give negative returns in 2022,companies," The ongoing downturn in the domestic stock market has seen nearly 83 percent of the stocks forming the Nifty 500 index, a collection of the biggest companies in the country, deliver flat or negative returns in 2022 so far. Many of these stocks are hovering below their 52-week lows and their 200-day moving average (DMA), data compiled by Moneycontrol showed. So far this year, the Nifty 500 index lost 12 percent, while the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have declined nearly 10 percent each. Companies that have seen the most erosion in their stock prices since the start of this year include Dhani Services, Solara Active Pharma, Brightcom Group, Indiabulls Real Estate, Metropolis Healthcare, Hikal, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dilip Buildcon, Welspun India, Nazara Tech, One97 Communications, Zomato and Sterlite Tech, which have lost 40-80 percent. Nifty 50 stocks such as Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, BPCL, IndusInd Bank, Shree Cement, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Wipro, Infosys, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, and Grasim Industries hit one-year lows recently. All these stocks are down between 8-40 percent this year. ""The broader market has been under pressure mainly due to the heavy FII selling. Concerns of premium valuation and higher impact of inflation on their profitability led to sharper fall in broader markets"" said Sneha Poddar, AVP, Research Analyst, Broking and Distribution, MOFSL However, the sharp correction in the market is also being seen as an opportunity by some market participants. “I think it's the right time for long-term investors to add to good growth stocks, which are available at attractive valuations,” Narendra Solanki, Head-Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said. Solanki believes investors should continue to hold existing stocks in their portfolios, if growth prospects of the company are intact as the “current volatility is more in the short-to-medium term, while long-term prospects for our economy remain promising”. Analysts attribute the negative or low returns in some popular consumer durables, auto, banking, realty and metal stocks that are actively traded in futures and options (F&O) on the perception that higher cost of borrowing and product prices will hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with persistently high input prices. Metal stocks have already been under pressure since the government’s decision to impose export duty on steel to cool domestic prices. Among IT stocks, volatility in the global markets amid higher inflation and expectations of tightening by central banks, along with the Russia-Ukraine war, which is unlikely to end soon, may see a slowdown in order books. Most Indian IT companies are moving their operations out of Russia, while helping clients maintain business continuity by shifting work to other locations. This is likely to increase margin pressures further, analysts said. Oil & gas stocks were under pressure as investors feared that interest rate hikes from major central banks could slow the global economy and cut demand for energy. Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher expects markets to remain volatile for the next three months as he believes inflation is likely to remain high and geo political tensions will not end soon."

0,"HDFC Bank to add 1,500-2,000 branches every year for 5 years",companies," HDFC Bank proposes to double its network of branches in the next three to five years by adding 1,500 to 2,000 branches annually, which would akin to adding a new HDFC Bank every five years, said its managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan. Outlining justification for merger of HDFC with the HDFC Bank in his letter to shareholders in the annual report 2021-22, Jagdishan said: ""The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge, and we can potentially add an HDFC Bank every five years."" He further said that the bank proposes to nearly double its network of branches in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year. Currently it has over 6,000 branches across India. ""The density of branches for the population of this country is way below that of OECD countries. This is where our branch banking strategy comes in. Today we have 6,000-plus branches across India, and we plan to nearly double our network in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year,"" he said. In early April this year, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and its subsidiary HDFC Bank had announced a transformational merger, which is expected to be completed in about 15 to 18 months. Christening the merger as the 'Power of One', Jagdishan said the bank looks forward to the phenomenal set of talent, deep product knowledge and expertise, the processes, and system that the lender will add to the existing ones. HDFC Bank cannot afford to miss this opportunity, Jagdishan said, adding that home loans are emotional products and bring with them a host of accelerated benefits for the bank. ""Today the environment for buying a home has changed. RERA has ensured greater transparency in the process. Price corrections in the property market have seen inventories come down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs have come down as a percentage of a person's income,"" the official said. He said with the penetration of telecom, internet and television services, the desire to own better homes has increased across the country. ""All this means that housing is going to be a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of India's GDP over the next decade."" Putting forth the statistics, Jagdishan said that only 2 per cent of its customers source their home loans from it, while 5 per cent do it from other institutions. ""The latter is equivalent to the size of our retail book. Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are 5 to 7 times that of other retail customers. And about 70 per cent of HDFC Ltd's customers do not bank with us."" All these give HDFC Bank the idea about the size of the opportunity, he said, adding that the long tenor nature of home loans provides resilience to the balance sheet. The bank is one of the largest consumer durable financiers in the country. ""We can easily bundle this with a home loan, as with every home loan, there is a propensity of a customer to take new consumer durables. It is this kind of bundling that will increase margins. With the advantage of a lower cost of funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity,"" he said. Reasoning the timing of merger, he said there are other favourable factors too such as narrowing down of the regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs over the last few years, with the reserve requirements coming down to about 22 per cent from 26 per cent. ""Both institutions are well-capitalised and have surplus liquidity and a strong portfolio of investments in government securities. The increase in priority sector lending that we need to do, due to the merger, is possible now with our own increased focus on MSMEs, the affordable housing loans that we can do and the well-developed PSL certificate market. ""All this means that on the day of the merger there may not be any need to raise further funds to meet reserve requirements. The addition of the home mortgages portfolio on our balance sheet makes it more diversified and robust."" Futher, the enhanced capital position of the bank post the merger also means that the lender can take bigger exposures in leading corporates and power the country's infrastructure build out, Jagdishan said. He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. ""The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future."" He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. On the capital raise plans, the lender said it proposes to raise an amount not exceeding Rs 50,000 crore by issuing long-term bonds on a private placement basis. It will seek shareholders' approval in the ensuing annual general meeting scheduled for July 16, 2022 for the fundraise plan."
1,Bank branches set to be next battleground for life insurers,companies," India’s banks double up as direct sales agents of a host of financial products, and life insurance needs their support more than any other. With the country’s largest life insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India becoming serious about bancassurance, the biggest growth-driving distribution channel is also set to become an area of intense competition. In media interactions, LIC chairman MR Kumar has stressed that he would focus on bancassurance tie-ups and improve the contribution of the channel to overall growth. The share of bancassurance must go up to 8-10 percent from the current 3 percent, Kumar said in a recent interview to Business Standard. Eventually, LIC is aiming for 15 percent of its premium to come from this channel. What does this mean for competitors? Before answering this question, it pays to look at the status of the bancassurance channel.  Banca is slowing Bancassurance remains the biggest contributor to growth but its share in the overall business has come down. As the adjoining chart shows, private life insurers HDFC Life Insurance Company, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company and SBI Life Insurance Company all depend heavily on bank branches of their parent companies for growth. But the share of the channel in retail premium has declined over time. In FY18, about 65 percent of SBI Life’s premiums used to come from policies sold by branches of parent State Bank of India. This has fallen to 63 percent in FY22. For ICICI Prudential Life, the share of parent ICICI Bank’s branches in overall premiums has fallen to 39 percent in FY22 from 52 percent in FY18. Analysts said banks will remain the bedrock of business for life insurers. “The fall in banca’s share is mostly because some of these life insurers were looking to diversify their channels. These entities were looking to decrease their reliance on bancassurance for diversification purposes,” said Sahil Idani, assistant vice president at ICRA Ltd. Indeed, private sector life insurers have indicated their intentions to diversify their channel mix to avoid dependence on one channel for business. Sangramjit Sarangi, president & chief financial officer of SBI Life believes that most banks are being nimble and innovating which would keep the bancassurance channel relevant to life insurers. The biggest advantage is cost. ""The Banca and agency channel differ significantly in terms of acquisition cost incurred because of the absence of substantial infrastructure and the associated costs related to the acquisition of business in the former,"" he said in an email response. Indeed, even for standalone life insurers such as Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Birla Sun Life, the share of bancassurance is high. As Sandeep Mishra, chief distribution officer-partnerships and group business at Bharti Axa Life Insurance Company puts it, insurance is an affinity product and the need for a helping hand in making decisions is done by the banking and agency channel more than digital. “Insurance is an affinity sale. So the bancassurance channel is definitely going to be there,” he said. It shouldn’t be surprising that LIC is getting serious about leveraging its otherwise slumberous tie-ups with banks. Elephant in the branch Bancassurance brings in only 3 percent of LIC’s business – the majority is brought in by its unrivalled network of agents. After its listing, though, LIC has faced flak from investors over its high-cost agent-dominant business. That may be about to change now as a sharper focus on profitability would mean that LIC will need to leverage its legacy tie-ups with banks. This focus on profitability has also meant that LIC wants to ramp up its non-participatory policies. This sits well with the bancassurance model as non-par products sell well in bank branches due to their simplicity.  Sarangi pointed out that market-linked products and non-par policies drive the volume in bancassurance. The company has indicated that it would explore more tie-ups but until now it hasn’t gotten more bang out of its buck from the 62,000 odd outlets. The slow moving insurance elephant doesn’t seem to bother private life insurers. “LIC is still a public sector unit and swift movement is not in its DNA. Even if they leverage bancassurance, private sector players are far ahead. More importantly, the digital edge too lies with them,” said an analyst requesting anonymity. Also, competition is limited to the extent banks choose to have an open architecture. The banking regulator allows a bank to hawk products of up to three life insurers. But banks such as ICICI Bank and State Bank of India opt to have exclusive arrangements that distribute only products of their respective insurance companies. HDFC Bank on the other hand has an open architecture and can sell products of life insurers other than HDFC Life. LIC is keen to join hands with such banks. Notwithstanding LIC’s history of being slow to adapt, private life insurers will find tough competition given the brand recall of LIC. “They (LIC) have a big brand recall. If they seriously pursue bancassurance distribution, then they can definitely challenge the rest of us here. But where they would get challenged is the aggression and agility of private sector players and that matters when it comes to customer focus,” said Mishra."
2,Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter deal gets board endorsement,companies," Twitter's board has recommended unanimously that shareholders approve the proposed $44 billion sale of the company to billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday. Musk reiterated his desire to move forward with the acquisition last week during a virtual meeting with Twitter employees, though shares of Twitter remain far below his offering price, signaling considerable doubt that it will happen. Shares rose about 3% to $38.98 before the opening bell Tuesday, far short of the $54.20 per-share that Musk has offered for each share. The company's stock last reached that level on April 5 when it offered Musk a seat on the board before he had offered to buy all of Twitter."
3,Kellogg Company splits into 3 independent businesses,companies," Kellogg Company, the maker of popular cereals brands such as Kellogg’s, Frosted Flakes, and Froot Loops, has announced the splitting of its business into three independent companies, by spinning off its US, Canadian, and Caribbean cereal and plant-based businesses. The remaining businesses will focus on global snacking, international cereal and noodles, and North American frozen breakfasts, the company. The company said that this trifurcation of the company is aimed at creating a greater strategic, operational, and financial focus for both the company and its stakeholders. The three companies (temporary names) would be ‘Global Snacking Co’, ‘North America Cereal Co’, and ‘North America Cereal Co’. Global Snacking Co with about $11.4 billion in net sales, the company said, will operate in global snacking, international cereal and noodles, and North American frozen breakfast. North America Cereal Co with about $2.4 billion in net sales, will be a cereal company in the US, Canada, and Caribbean markets. And, Plant Co with about $340 million in net sales, will be a plant-based foods company, anchored by the MorningStar Farms brand. “These businesses all have significant standalone potential, and an enhanced focus will enable them to better direct their resources toward their distinct strategic priorities,” the company’s CEO Steve Cahillane said. In recent years, the company said it has transformed its portfolio into one that has expanded geographically and shifted toward growing businesses, particularly in snacking categories. “The successful execution of these actions has expanded Kellogg’s portfolio, resulting in a scaled global snacking business and significant emerging markets presence, complemented by strong and profitable breakfast and plant-based foods businesses. The outcome of these strategic actions has been improved growth in recent years, with momentum sustained into 2022,” it added. “After several years of transformation and improving results, the company believes it is the right time to separate these businesses so they may pursue their particular strategic priorities,” said the company. According to the Kellogg Company, as independent companies, all three businesses will be better positioned to Focus on their distinct strategic priorities, with financial targets that best fit their own markets and opportunities; North America Cereal Co. and Plant Co. will both remain headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan. Global Snacking Co. will maintain dual campuses in Battle Creek and Chicago, Illinois, with their corporate headquarters located in Chicago. Kellogg Company's three international regions' headquarters in Europe, Latin America, and AMEA will remain in their current locations, Kellogg Company said. Kellogg Company’s three international regions – Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA) – will remain almost entirely intact within Global Snacking Co. Steve Cahillane will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Global Snacking Co. The proposed management team for North America Cereal Co. and Plant Co. will be announced at a later date."
4,"South Indian Bank to seek shareholders' nod to raise Rs 2,500 Crore in Jul AGM",companies," Private sector lender South Indian Bank (SIB) is planning to raise up to Rs 2,500 crore to shore up its capital base for business growth and meet regulatory norms. The bank's shareholders had given approval for this fundraise in the previous AGM last fiscal, however, the bank did not raise the funds. A banking company requires adequate capital not only to meet the needs of a growing business but also to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, SIB said in a regulatory filing. In its ensuing annual general meeting (AGM) scheduled to be held on July 12, the lender will seek shareholders' approval to raise tier-I capital of up to Rs 2,000 crore through the issuance of securities by various modes. It will also seek permission to raise an additional Rs 500 crore to comply with Basel III norms by issuing bonds on a private placement basis. ""As the business grows, capital requires to be augmented. The bank expects to continue its robust growth trajectory in the medium to long-term. Availability of adequate capital is one of the key requirements for achieving this feat. "" ""As a proactive move to leverage the available business opportunities and for maintaining appropriate regulatory capitalisation levels, the bank proposes to raise additional capital aggregating up to Rs 2,000 crore or its equivalent amount,"" the bank said. Even though the bank has proposed to raise additional capital aggregating up to Rs 2,000 crore during 93rd AGM held on August 18, 2021, due to adverse market situation the bank has not raised the same, it added. The lender may raise the equity capital in foreign currencies by way of Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) on a private placement basis or may issue foreign currency convertible bonds or issue fully convertible debentures/partly convertible debentures, or any other financial instruments or securities convertible into equity shares. The issue of securities may be consummated in one or more tranches, it said. Besides, the lender said that it will borrow funds in Indian/foreign currency by issue of Basel III compliant debt securities on a private placement basis in one or more tranches for an amount not exceeding Rs 500 crore, within the overall borrowing limits of the bank, as approved by the members. ""…the board of directors, after assessing its fund requirements, has proposed to obtain the consent of the members of the bank for borrowing/raising funds in Indian/ foreign currency by issue of debt securities including but not limited to non-convertible debentures, bonds, up to Rs 500 crore in one or more tranches in domestic and/or overseas market,"" it noted. Likewise, the lender had obtained the nod from shareholders for this capital raise in the preceding AGM held in August 2021. However, it did not raise any debt capital during 2021-22, hence approval is needed afresh for the same. Shares of South Indian Bank closed at Rs 7.52 apiece on BSE, up 1.90 per cent on BSE."
5,Indian skincare startup Mamaearth eyes $3 billion valuation in 2023 IPO - sources,companies," Sequoia Capital-backed Indian skincare startup Mamaearth is in talks to raise at least $300 million in a planned IPO next year and is seeking a valuation of around $3 billion, three people with direct knowledge of the company's plans told Reuters Founded in 2016, Mamaearth has become popular in India with its range of ""toxin-free"" products such as face washes, shampoos and hair oils. It competes with Unilever's India unit, Hindustan Unilever, and Procter & Gamble Co in the booming personal care industry. The company was last valued at $1.2 billion in January this year when it raised fresh funds from investors including Sequoia and Belgium's Sofina. Mamaearth is targetting a valuation of around $3 billion – 10-12 times forward earnings based on sales growth and future revenue potential, a person briefed on the discussions said. It plans to file draft regulatory papers by the end of this year, said sources, who declined to be named as the plan is private. Two of those sources said Mamaearth is in early-stage discussions to raise at least $300 million in its IPO, with a third source pegging the number at $350 million. A Mamaearth spokesperson declined to comment on its IPO plans. The company's target valuation for the IPO, and the funds it plans to raise, have not been previously reported. The company is in talks with JP Morgan Chase, India's JM Financial and Kotak Mahindra Capital to appoint them as bookrunners to the deal, the sources added JP Morgan Chase declined to comment. JM Financial and Kotak did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mamaearth's IPO plans come during a broader rout in capital markets and a slowdown in India's booming startup ecosystem that recorded a steller $35 billion in record fundraising last year. Now, some startups are cutting back on staff and finding it difficult to raise funds, Reuters has reported. Mamaearth was co-founded by Varun Alagh, a former Hindustan Unilever executive, and his wife Ghazal. With the brand endorsed by popular Bollywood celebrities, the duo has cashed in on growing e-commerce adoption in India by offering its products on platforms such as Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart. India's beauty and personal care industry is expected to grow to $27.5 billion by 2025, from $17.8 billion in 2020, Indian financial services firm Avendus estimates. The number of online shoppers for beauty products is also projected to rise to 135 million from 25 million during that period, it added. One equity research analyst, however, said the success of Mamaearth's IPO could hinge on how it plans to rapidly expand into offline sales. Most Indians still go to retail outlets to shop, with e-commerce accounting for just 5-6% of spending. CEO Alagh told the Business Standard newspaper in January that 70% of Mamaearth's sales come from online platforms, but it was targetting a bigger offline presence and aiming to reach 40,000 retail outlets in 100 cities this year. For the fiscal year ended in March 2022, Mamaearth's parent, Honasa Consumer Pvt Ltd, registered a revenue of $130 million, with a small profit, said one of the three sources. The company recorded a post-tax profit of 246 million Indian rupees ($3.15 million) for the year ended March 2021."

12,"Explained | How will decline in edible oil price impact FMCG companies, consumers",companies," After climbing steadily for several quarters, edible oil prices have finally started to decline, bringing much-needed relief to Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) makers. Edible oils such as palm oil are a key commodity used by FMCG makers like Hindustan Unilever, Marico, Dabur, Godrej Consumer Products, ITC and Tata Consumer Products and the skyrocketing price of the commodity led to inflated input costs for these companies. Most companies have indicated that they expect inflation to abate towards the second half of the year. Moneycontrol explains what led to the jump in edible oil prices, what has prompted the fall now, how this will impact FMCG companies, and which entities stand to benefit the most. Also, will companies pass on the decline to consumers? What led to the jump in edible oil prices? Palm oil prices rose because of a fall in production in major edible-oil producing countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Argentina, Ukraine and Russia due to unfavourable weather. Almost all of India’s palm oil requirements are met by Indonesia and Malaysia. According to ICRA, palm oil makes up about 40 percent of total edible oil consumption in India and 60 percent of it is imported. Similarly, prices of other edible oils such as soybean rose last year because of dry weather in Argentina, the largest exporter. Prices of most edible oils had shown signs of stabilising at the start of 2022, but the outbreak in February of the war between Russia and Ukraine, major exporters of sunflower oil, led to even higher prices. To plug the shortfall in sunflower oil, companies started looking for alternatives, leading to higher demand, price jumps and shortages. As a result, Indonesia, grappling with a shortage in the domestic market banned the export of palm oil, leading to chaos in the market as prices surged to as high as $1,800-1,900 per metric tonne (MT). What has helped the fall now? After several quarters, palm oil prices are finally in a downward trend. Palm oil is trading at $1,300 per MT compared to its peak of $1,800-1,900 per MT. The steep reduction in prices followed government intervention. The Indian government late in May scrapped import duties on sunflower oil and soyabean oil. A lifting of the palm oil import ban by Indonesia and higher availability of sunflower oil, including an improved domestic crop, have also helped. Following a drop in prices, companies such as Adani Wilmar, which sells edible oil under the Fortune brand, and Mother Dairy, which owns Dhara, have already reduced prices. The maximum retail price (MRP) of Dhara edible oils are being reduced by up to Rs 15 a litre across variants, Mother Dairy said in a recent press statement. Adani Wilmar has slashed edible oil prices by Rs 10. “Adani Wilmar has reduced the MRP of Fortune refined Sunflower oil’s 1-litre pack from Rs. 220 to Rs. 210 and MRP of Fortune Soyabean and Fortune Kachi Ghani (mustard oil) 1-litre pack from Rs 205 to Rs 195,” the company said. How will the development impact FMCG companies? A drop in edible prices, especially palm oil, augurs well for FMCG companies, which incur a significant amount of their input costs on these commodities. Sample this, palm oil accounts for 50-60 percent of input costs in soap. Palm oil and its derivatives are key commodities used in other FMCG products such as skin care products, shampoos, biscuits and noodles. The cost of several products of daily use had climbed substantially due to inflation in the past year; unable to contain rising costs, FMCG companies passed on the price increase to consumers. The price increases brought on temporary relief to companies and reinforced their margins but the move took a toll on demand, especially in rural India. FMCG companies such as HUL reported the first signs of a slowdown in the rural economy in the first quarter of FY22. A sluggish economy made it challenging for these companies to pass on the cost increase to consumers, denting their margins further. The gross margin of HUL, for instance, contracted by 331 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) in Q4. Dabur reported a 130-bps YoY contraction in gross margin to 47.4 percent due to inflation. A fall in input prices benefits food and beverage companies such as Parle Products, Britannia, Nestle, and also companies that have a large presence in the personal care segment. “The sharp correction in palm oil (price) bodes well for many FMCG players, especially HUL, Britannia, GCPL and Nestle,” said Abneesh Roy, executive director, Edelweiss. “Palm oil has come down from peak levels. Malaysia and Indonesia have become competitive in terms of exports, which bodes well for Indian companies and consumers. We are enthused by this deflation, but need to see its sustainability,” he added. Will the fall in commodity prices benefit consumers? Consumers will have to wait a bit longer to see a reduction in the prices of packaged consumer goods. “The palm oil prices have dropped significantly in the last 20 days and this will definitely have a cool-down effect on input costs. However, we will have to see which direction the prices go in the days ahead. We will have to wait for some time and then take a call on reducing the prices as it is too early right now,” said Amit Kumat, CEO and MD, Prataap Snacks, which sells potato chips, snacks and Indian savouries under the brand Yellow Diamond. Mayank Shah, senior category head, Parle Products, too, said he does not anticipate a reduction in prices immediately as most companies are yet to factor in the increase in input costs. He also indicated that it is very unlikely that FMCG companies will reduce prices."

20,"As the world of work changes, role of HR is shifting from recruiter to relationship manager",companies," With a change in the world of work and the hiring ecosystem in the past couple of years, the role of human resource (HR) managers in companies has assumed greater significance, and changed from a recruiter to a relationship manager for the employees/staff, and business goals, and from payroll in-charge to problem solvers. With the evolution of workspace dynamics, hybrid work becoming a new normal, and employee retention assuming greater meaning, HR leaders are reinventing themselves - at least several of them if not all. HR, as a business role, has evolved, said Chandrajit Pati, Chief People Officer of agrochemicals firm PI Industries. He said managers across sectors have become more of solution providers for employees and for business units. Ritu Rakhra, Regional HR Head (India), Dell Technologies, said the role of HR has evolved in the last few years. In the last couple of years, the HR function has changed as much as the entire business outlook, she said. ""The pandemic impacted everyone...then the great reshuffle happened, and the challenge of retention assumed significance across industries. HR and people leaders are now increasingly focusing on wellness, mental health of employees, and making that extra effort to connect with employees and teams, via team leaders and focused programs,"" Rakhra explained. Pati said HR managers across industries are open to listening to employees more. Besides, he and his team have given a lot of access to colleagues to solve their issues on a regular basis. The relationship is not confined to one or two duties anymore, but is about nurturing constant relationships, and conscious relationship. Hiring is no more transactional. It is a relationship between the hiring managers or recruiters, and possible employees. While at the lower end of the employee pyramid, transactional behaviour is still dominant, at the mid and senior levels recruiters are building relationships. “All of a sudden HR has been catapulted to the business operations (space too) ...When you handle people, you are not doing it in isolation anymore, you have to manage people along with other stakeholders, including your Board…” Pati of PI Industries, said. Recruiters and staffing firms also argued that the rigidity around employee engagement, hiring, rehiring, etc is getting redefined and the role of HR is growing in stature."
21,Storyboard18 | IPL digital rights win will unlock the potential of Bharat market for Viacom18,companies," Winning the entire bouquet of digital rights for the IPL 2023-2027 cycle is the beginning of a new innings for Viacom18 as Experts see the brand surpassing the subscription and ad revenue benchmarks set by competitor Disney+Hotstar. “In 2021 Disney+Hotstar clocked close to Rs 1050 to 1100 crore as revenue on the back of IPL, almost 50% came from subscriptions. While there is no clear understanding on whether Viacom18 will stream via just Voot or bundle it up with JioTV but this combination has the potential to unlock the immense potential of the Bharat market (Middle India and Rural India) and that is when subscriptions will start flowing in from not just metros but also Tier-II and Tier-III cities,” said Ramsai Panchapakesan, senior vice president and national head - Integrated Media Buying at Zenith. According to Ramsai the fact that winning bids of TV and digital rights of IPL this season were so close tells a lot about the stage at which each of the mediums are. While Viacom shelled out Rs 23,758 crore for Package B and Package C that club all digital rights together, 23,758, Star India bagged TV rights for the same cycle for Rs 23,575 crore. “TV has reached its maturity in terms of inventory innovation as well as reach while digital has a lot of room for growth and innovation. Another interesting fact we are seeing is that the connected TV (CTV) base is growing at a quick pace and as of May, India has reached close to 95 million CTV viewers providing an opportunity to monetize by attracting more premium brands,” he said. “With no pressure of incremental growth as in the case of Star that had both TV and OTT rights, digital will now completely be propelled with the new benchmarks and advertisers will come to Viacom18 for digital focus growth and sharp targeting,” he added. While close to 28 to 31 percent of total viewership for IPL for Star came from digital, Viacom18 expected to take the number to new heights with new initiatives to push growth for their platform, experts. Turns out, the entry price for digital ad inventory may go up by 1.8x but to counter that publisher may start breaking down their cohorts to keep entry costs affordable for both new and existing advertisers. In terms of ad format, Disney + Hotstar offered inventories in display ads (billboard, native mage) and video ads (bumper, mid-rolls, carousel, leadgen). Viacom18 as per domain experts will bring in newer formats and at revised ad rates. While a mid-roll ad on digital costs anywhere between Rs180-Rs210 CPM per 10 seconds, in 2023 the prices (CPM) can touch Rs260 to 300 for the same duration. The natural question that comes here is why would advertisers pay the premium for the upcoming season? The simple answer to that is - reach. The growing reach has always been the sales pitch for IPL inventory. Interestingly according to media buyers, there is no history attached to pricing negotiations. “People refer to the previous year's pricing only for the sake of comparison and Star has always gone ahead with whatever price made sense for them and advertisers have negotiated but never complained because of the sheer reach of the league,” said an industry insider. The other factor that would justify the premium pricing for advertisers would be the novelty factor of the platform. “Disney + Hotstar has a very different audience profile when compared to Voot. So advertisers will gain a new set of audiences who are Voot loyalists. So there will be new subscribers to the existing set. This heterogeneous audience will have immense potential for targeting across categories,” said Gaurav Saini, founder at Chandigarh-based IPL specialised media agency, Big Media Kart. Alongside being the launch pad for various new cricketers, IPL has also opened up monetisation options for a lot of digital players. In 2011, Indiatimes, the then mobile and audio rights partner for IPL had announced its partnership with Google wherein all 74 matches of the league were streamed on its dedicated YouTube channel. “Back in 2011 IPL helped YouTube launch their ad format in India and even with Disney+Hotstar the entire reach of the platform was propelled by IPL. Viacom18 picking it up this time will see similar trends because IPL as a property is growing year on year and is the largest canvas that the country has to garner viewership and reach,” Kavita Shenoy, founder and CEO at Voiro Bangalore-based ad-tech and SaaS start-up Voiro provides revenue analytics and workflow automation solutions to media and content-led companies like Voot and others."

0,"'Auto ancillaries' revenue may grow 8-10% in FY23 on stable demand, easing supply-chain woes'",companies," Auto ancillaries' revenues are expected to grow 8-10 per cent in 2022-23 on the back of a stable demand and likely easing of supply-chain concerns in the second half of the year, Icra said on Monday. At the same time, the sector's coverage metrics is also likely to remain comfortable in 2022-23, benefitting from healthy accruals and relatively low incremental debt funding requirements, the rating agency said in a release. In last fiscal year, 31 auto component companies with cumulative revenues of over Rs 1,75,000 crore had registered a 23 per cent year-on-year growth in revenues, driven by domestic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), replacement, export volumes and pass-through of commodity prices. Though the growth came on a relatively low base of FY21, the actual revenue expansion was better than Icra's estimates, partly on account of better-than-expected exports and increase in realisations to pass on the impact of higher commodity inflation and freight costs, it said. Icra's estimation of operating margins for FY2022 had factored in operating leverage benefits. However, the unprecedented inflation in raw material costs and freight costs in H2 FY2022 (October-March )and inability to pass on the same completely and in a timely manner impacted the profit margins in previous fiscal year, according to the release. Operating margins for the sample 31 auto component companies in FY2022 were the lowest in last five years, it added. Icra expects auto ancillaries' revenues to grow by 8-10 per cent in FY2023, supported by stable demand as well as the expected easing of supply-chain related issues in H2 FY2023. Over the long-term, premiumisation of vehicles, focus on localisation, improved exports potential and EV opportunities, resulting in higher content per vehicle, would translate to healthy growth for auto component suppliers, in our view, said Vinutaa S, Vice President and sector head at Icra. According to her, auto ancillaries have displayed adequate liquidity position, especially across tier-I and tier-II players. Icra expects the coverage metrics for this sector to remain comfortable going forward as well, aided by healthy accruals and relatively low incremental debt funding, she stated. The estimated revenue growth for the sample in FY2022 was constrained by factors like semiconductor shortage issues, muted two-wheeler and tractor demand, and the impact of geopolitical developments on international business, she said. However, the industry's actual revenues were supported by healthy exports and better realisations. Icra's sample of 30 companies (excluding a large auto component supplier) reported operating margins of 10.6 per cent for FY2022, 10 basis points lower on a Y-o-Y basis, and 40 basis points lower than projections, she added. Uncertainties on the supply-chain front and cost inflation resulted in auto ancillaries stocking higher inventory, with inventory levels for the sample being the highest as of March 31, 2022, compared to the last four years. Nevertheless, the working capital intensity remains comfortable, at sub 10 per cent levels, according to Icra. It highlighted that operating profits for the sample were higher in previous fiscal year when compared to FY2020 and FY2021, aided by healthy revenues, despite a marginal dip in operating margins. Icra said while debt levels increased with rise in working capital intensity, the improvement in operating profits resulted in comfortable debt coverage indicators for the industry. It also said the capex spend of the auto ancillary sample for FY2022 as a proportion of their operating income was 5.9 per cent, lower than the pre-COVID levels of over 7.5 per cent, which was in line with Icra's estimates. The incremental investments have been primarily towards capability development-- new product additions, product development for committed platforms, and development of advanced technological and EV components-- unlike investments towards capacity expansion witnessed in the past."
1,VIL board meeting on June 22 to consider up to Rs 500 crore fundraising from Vodafone Group,companies," Vodafone Idea's Board is scheduled to meet on June 22, to consider and approve a proposal for raising funds to the tune of Rs 500 crore. The fundraising will be through the issuance of equity shares or convertible warrants on a preferential basis to one or more entities belonging to Vodafone Group (one of the promoters of the company). ""... A meeting of the Board of Directors of the company is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, 22nd June 2022... to consider proposal for raising of funds aggregating up to Rs 500 crore, by way of issuance of equity shares and / or convertible warrants on a preferential basis to one or more entities belonging to Vodafone Group (one of the promoters of the company),"" VIL said in a filing to BSE on Sunday evening. The move comes as the Indian telecom market is poised for 5G spectrum auction, and subsequent roll out of new-age offerings. Following the September reforms announced by the Centre, debt-ridden Vodafone Idea (VIL) had opted for converting about Rs 16,000 crore interest dues liability payable to the government, into equity. This will result in the government holding about 33 per cent stake in the company. Sources at the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said that VIL's equity conversion proposal is in final stages, and required approvals on the same are expected as early as 7-10 days."
2,"Consumer durable stocks slide on falling demand, slowdown fears",companies," India's consumer durable stocks have been trading lower over fears that higher cost of borrowing and product prices would hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with steep input prices. The BSE consumer durables index has fallen over 11 percent in the last 15 sessions, 12 of which ended in losses. Since the start of June, Amber Enterprises India has lost 21 percent, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail  16 percent, Titan Co Ltd  14 percent, Whirlpool Of India Ltd  13 percent, Dixon Technologies 13 percent, Havells India 12 percent, Blue Star 10 percent, Voltas 8.5 percent, Bajaj Electricals 7 percent, and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals 5 percent. Rising interest rates are a key overhang for the consumer durable sector coupled with higher commodity prices, analysts say. Higher interest rates could deter consumers who depend on unsecured loans for the purchase of such items, they say. Margin pressure, which was visible in the March quarter earnings, is expected to persist in the June and September quarters as well despite price hikes undertaken by these companies. Though raw material prices have cooled a bit in the past few weeks, a bigger correction is needed to sustain the margin, analysts say. The Reserve Bank of India has raised the policy repo rate by 90 basis points since May to stave off persistently high inflation which hit an 18-month high in April. ""Despite recent corrections, commodity prices still remain elevated. There is a fear of US recession which has impacted investor sentiment on all consumption items globally including India. “On the other hand, higher crude prices and currency depreciation has been adding cost inflation for all the manufacturers, impacting the bottom line of the companies directly"" Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, said. Recent reports of large price hikes by consumer firms to offset the surge in commodity inflation will likely reduce demand, experts say. ""The companies are examining the situation and will undertake calibrated price hikes to mitigate the inflationary pressure, which is expected to impact the overall demand in an already sluggish scenario"" said Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities. Chandan Taparia, Vice President, Equity Derivatives and Technical, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, expects the consumer durables index likely to correct 5-7 percent more, given the recent price pattern and weak chart setup. ""Inflation has peaked and demand-pull back will cause inflation to soften. However, with the expectation of good monsoon and consequent rural recovery, we expect consumer demand to pick up with a quarter's lag"", Bolinjkar said."

6,Beer makers record sales surge after a lull of two years,companies," Beer makers like United Breweries, B9 Beverages and DeVANS Modern Breweries have reported a surge in beer sales this year after a two-year disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DeVANS Modern Breweries, which sells brands such as Godfather, Kotsberg Pils and Six Fields, sales in the first five months of 2022 jumped as much as 15 percent compared to the pre-COVID period. “Our sales plummeted by nearly 80 percent during the period January-May 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 due to the complete shutdown imposed due to the pandemic. In 2021, sales increased by 73 percent (as compared to 2020) due to lesser impact of the pandemic. However, sales this year have been exceptional,” said Prem Dewan, managing director of DeVANS Modern. “We expect to end FY23 with an increase of at least 80 percent over the FY20 figure,” he added. DeVANS expects to close FY23 with sales of over 8 million cases and cross 12 million cases in FY24. United Breweries, which sells Kingfisher and Heineken, too, reported a surge in sales. “This year, with an early and intense summer, we witnessed normalcy in the market which has aided volume recovery post-COVID. March saw significant momentum and was a harbinger for the peak season,” said Rishi Pardal, managing director and chief executive officer, United Breweries. Summers are the peak season for brewers, which draw about 40-50 percent of sales during the season. Sales of alcoholic beverages including beer fell 30-40 percent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to industry estimates. Barley woes Beer makers had prepared for a significant jump in sales this season and ramped up their production capacity. Supply constraints caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and inflation have dampened their spirits somewhat. B9 Beverages, maker of the Bira91 craft beer, has its breweries in the North, East and West running at nearly full capacity,  founder and CEO Ankur Jain said. Even so, it isn’t able to meet demand in certain parts of the country, he said. The war between Russia and Ukraine, exporters of over a third of the world’s barley and wheat, has resulted in a global shortage of these grains. India, according to earlier estimates, was expected to produce surplus wheat this season, but unfavourable weather has led to a fall in production of the commodity, given harvest losses in Punjab and Haryana. The India government slashed its estimate of wheat output for FY22-23 to 105 million tonnes from 111.23 million tonnes. The shortage has triggered several challenges for beer makers, which had been eager to tap the surge in demand this season. “The biggest dampener this year has been the huge increase in cost of all inputs,” said Dewan. According to the industry, the price of barley has doubled, the cost of glass bottles has increased by more than 30 percent and is expected to rise still further. The price of all other inputs, including cartons used for packaging, has increased in double digits. Beer makers are working on mitigating inputs costs while taking steps to ensure steady supply of raw materials. “At present, we have five breweries that are operational but as the market expectations increase, we will continue to align our capacity and meet the growing consumer demand. Moreover, we are also securing raw materials in adequate quantities to ensure uninterrupted production and supply,” said Jain. Price hikes Brewers have hiked prices to mitigate the impact of inflation. Given that in India, prices of alcoholic beverages are controlled by state governments, which derive a significant part of revenue from brewers and distillers, companies are yet to convince certain states to increase prices. United Breweries has introduced price hikes in Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and a number of smaller states. B9 Beverages has raised the price of Bira 91 in most states and changed the composition of its product mix in some others to mitigate the impact of inflation."

9,India's Russian coal purchases spike despite sanctions,companies," India's purchases of Russian coal have spiked in recent weeks despite global sanctions on Moscow, as traders offer discounts of up to 30%, according to two trade sources and data reviewed by Reuters. Russia, facing severe Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, warned the European Union in April against sweeping sanctions on coal, saying they would backfire as the fuel would be redirected to other markets. India has refrained from condemning Russia, with which it has longstanding political and security ties, while calling for an end to violence in Ukraine. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods as part of an effort to diversify supplies and argues a sudden halt would jack up world prices and hurt its consumers. U.S. officials have told India there is no ban on energy imports from Russia but they do not want to see a ""rapid acceleration"". Yet as European importers shun trade with Moscow, Indian buyers are lapping up huge quantities of Russian coal despite high freight costs. Its purchases of coal and related products jumped more than six-fold in the 20 days through Wednesday from the same period a year earlier to $331.17 million, according to unpublished Indian government data reviewed by Reuters. Indian refiners similarly have snapped up cheap Russian oil shunned by Western countries. The value of India's oil trade with Russia in the 20 days through Wednesday jumped more than 31-fold to $2.22 billion, the data showed. India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. ""The Russian traders have been liberal with payment routes and are accepting payments in Indian rupee and United Arab Emirates dirham,"" one source said. ""The discounts are attractive, and this trend of higher Russian coal purchases will continue."" COAL BUYING TO CONTINUE Offshore units of such Russian coal traders as Suek AG, KTK and Cyprus-based Carbo One in places including Dubai and Singapore offered discounts of 25% to 30%, triggering bulk purchases of Russian thermal coal by traders supplying to utilities and cement makers, the sources said. The second source said the Singapore-based unit of Suek was also accepting payments in dollars. Suek and KTK did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach Carbo One. The EU ban has barred new coal contracts and by mid-August will force members nations to terminate existing ones. India bought an average $16.55 million of Russian coal a day in the three weeks through Wednesday, more than double the $7.71 million it bought in the three months after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, according to Reuters calculations. Oil purchases averaged $110.86 million a day in the 20-day period, more than triple the $31.16 million it spent in the three months ended May 26. Indian bulk buying of Russian coal is set to continue, with June imports expected to be the most in at least seven and a half years, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed. Bulk shipments of Russian thermal coal started reaching India in the third week of May, with orders mainly from cement and steel firms and traders, according to shipping data compiled by an Indian coal trader."
10,Not easy for airline to turn profit in India: IATA official,companies," It is not easy for an airline to turn a profit in India and a lot of issues such as fare caps and high taxes on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) have to be resolved, a senior IATA official said. Philip Goh, Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific of International Air Transport Association (IATA), made the remarks during a press conference at the 78th annual general meeting of the global airlines body here. When asked if Vistara and Air India should be merged by the Tata Group, he replied, ""Both (Vistara and Air India) are full- service carriers. Vistara is still quite small and although they have been in business for 5-6 years, they are still loss making. It is not easy to turn a profit in India. A lot of issues to overcome."" Goh said he is sure that some sort of discussion must be happening between the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines on the merger of Air India and Vistara. ""It does make sense to look at synergies between two similar full-service carriers, he told reporters. While talking about India, Goh said that pricing ought to be left to airlines and should not be governed the way it is being governed. Goh said that taxation - on fuels and other things - is always an issue for the airlines. Any measures that are taken by the government that increase costs for airlines is bad for the economics of the aviation sector, he said. The civil aviation ministry had imposed lower and upper limits on domestic airfares based on flight duration when services were resumed on May 25, 2020, after a two-month lockdown due to the pandemic. For example, airlines currently cannot charge a passenger less than Rs 2,900 (excluding GST) and more than Rs 8,800 (excluding GST) on flights with a duration of less than 40 minutes. The Tata Group took control of Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express on January 27 after successfully winning the bid for the airlines on October 8 last year. The Tata Group has 83.67 per cent shares in AirAsia India whereas the remaining stake in the airline is with Malaysian carrier AirAsia Berhad. Competition Commission of India had on June 16 said it has approved the proposed acquisition of the entire shareholding of AirAsia India Ltd by Air India Ltd. Vistara is a joint venture company with the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines owning 51 per cent and 49 per cent shares, respectively. ""I think Tata's initiative (to merge AirAsia India with Air India) within their own group is sensible. I think that if you have four vehicles within the same group, you have to find some ways to rationalise the synergies within the group, Goh said. If Tatas form a strategy correctly, Air India could become a very powerful player in the Indian international market, he noted."
11,L&T Infotech-Mindtree merger likely by December: Official,companies," The amalgamation process of Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI) and Mindtree is likely to be completed by December, and during this period, both the companies will continue to operate independently, a senior official said. The two subsidiaries of Larsen & Toubro had last month announced a mega-merger to create an efficient and scaled-up IT services provider, exceeding USD 3.5 billion in combined revenue. The name of the combined entity will be 'LTIMindtree', the companies had said in a statement. We hope the merger will be completed in the next two quarters It is undergoing regulatory approvals. There are three-four agencies involved in the process, L&T Infotech Chief Operating Officer Nachiket Deshpande told PTI. Larsen & Toubro had acquired a controlling stake in Bengaluru-based Mindtree in 2019. Deshpande said he expects demand for IT services to continue to remain strong over the next three-five years, and supply-side constraints to ease within a few quarters. Once transformation in an organisation starts, it cannot be stopped midway. Despite recessionary fears, most of the customers with whom we spoke said they are not likely to reduce IT expenditure, he said. The senior official said L&T Infotech will increase its footprint across multiple cities and several locations are under evaluation for setting up new offices."
12,No hurry as we don't want to get stuck with unviable aircraft: Vistara CEO Vinod Kannan on leasing B787 Dreamliner,companies," Vistara is in no hurry to lease B787 Dreamliner aircraft to expand international flight operations as it does not want to get stuck with a plane that cannot be used viably, its CEO Vinod Kannan said. For more than a year, Boeing has not delivered any B787 plane as the US Aviation regulator wants it to first make rectifications in aircraft production line. Vistara had ordered six B787 planes in 2018 but it has got delivery of only two of those aircraft till date. The lack of more wide-bodied B787 aircraft has hampered the airline's expansion of international flight operations. Asked by when Vistara would like to have another Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet, Kannan said, I would like to have it yesterday. But the facts are that these things do take time. When you come up with a RFP (Request For Proposal) for a new aircraft, there are certain set of considerations. When you are looking into the market for aircraft that are used, you need to be looking at different parameters what is the age of the aircraft? What are the engines' capacities?... It is a different set of considerations with which we have to go with our eyes open, he noted. Kannan was talking to reporters on the sidelines of 78th annual general meeting of International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Doha. The last thing we want is to hurry and get stuck with an aircraft that we cannot utilise viably, he mentioned."
13,Air India considering procuring over 200 new planes; 70% to be narrow-bodied jets,companies," Tata Group-owned Air India is considering buying more than 200 new planes with 70 per cent of them being narrow-bodied aircraft, aviation industry sources said on Sunday. While Air India has zeroed in on Airbus's A350 wide-bodied aircraft for the procurement, the talks with Airbus and Boeing for narrow-bodied aircraft is still on, they said. A wide-bodied plane like Airbus A350 has a bigger fuel tank that allows it to travel longer distances such as the India-US routes. Air India has not bought a single aircraft since 2006 when it placed orders for purchasing 111 aircraft 68 from the US-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing and 43 from European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The Tata Group took control of Air India on January 27 after successfully winning the bid for the airline on October 8 last year. On the sidelines of 78th annual general meeting of International Air Transport Association, aviation industry sources said Air India is considering buying 200 new planes. The share of narrow-bodied aircraft to that of wide-bodied planes will be 70:30. They said that the decision on which narrow-bodied plane to buy to go for Airbus A320 family aircraft or Boeing's 737Max aircraft is yet to be taken."
14,How Sapphire Foods is operating in Sri Lanka’s challenging environment,companies," Even as Sri Lanka struggles with its worst financial crisis ever and faces acute shortage of several key products, including fuel, Sapphire Foods, a franchisee of Yum! Brands, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut stores in the country, is confident of revival. “We spoke to a lot of young markets who have gone through similar situations at a country level. All of them come back and say double down on the business. It is a great opportunity to actually build a very strong competitive position. Our execution advantages are playing out in this market,” Sanjay Purohit, Group CEO, Sapphire Foods, said in a conversation with Anuradha Sengupta in an episode on the ‘Life After Listing’ show. “I was speaking to the Sri Lankan team yesterday. And they are hopeful of things stabilising over the next four, six months,” he added. Meanwhile, Purohit said, given that the country has a large expat population in the Gulf countries, the crisis has led to huge remittances from these nations. According to Purohit, this has led to a lot of money in consumers’ hands and there is also willingness to spend. “People cannot cook at home as there is no gas, no fuel. So, they eat out,” he added. Although the company has reduced its hours of operations, it still has to make a lot of efforts to keep the stores open. For instance, one of its employees is always at the fuel pump to get diesel to run its stores in the wake of power cuts. “Unless there is a curfew, we are operating our stores,” Purohit added. The company will also continue to expand its stores in the country. Currently, it operates 95 outlets in the island nation and plans to launch 95 more stores in the next three-four years."
15,"Pizza Hut today offers better value than competitors: Sanjay Purohit, Group CEO, Sapphire Foods",companies," Sanjay Purohit, Group CEO, Sapphire Foods in an episode of ‘Life After Listing’ talks about the revamping of Pizza Hut and KFC stories and how this strategy has turned out to be effective for the brands. Sapphire Foods, the franchisee of Yum! Brands has rejigged its strategy for Pizza Hut, which the company’s Group CEO Sanjay Purohit says has worked well for the brand. The main focus of this rejig has been to make the brand more value-focussed. “In April 2019, we redid our menu to bring value in a very Pizza Hut manner. So, pizza, it is about meals and therefore, a meal for one, meal for two, meal for four, unlimited meals. And today in terms of value, Pizza Hut is fantastic better than even the competitor,” Purohit said in a conversation with Anuradha SenGupta in an episode of Life After Listing show. The company, shared Purohit, also worked to improve the delivery experience and as a result, draws about 40-45 percent of its sales comes from delivery as compared to 20 percent in the pre-pandemic times. “We have worked with our own app and with the aggregators to improve the delivery experience,” he added. Pizza Hut competes with Domino’s Pizza, whose master franchisee is Jubilant FoodWorks. Domino’s Pizza, which has built an extensive chain in India and commands about 55 percent share of the market, has positioned its offering to target the value-conscious consumers through deliveries. Sapphire Foods India operates 204 KFC restaurants in India and the Maldives and 231 Pizza Hut restaurants in India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Devyani International, the other Yum! Brand franchisee in India, operates 317 Pizza Hut stores and 284 KFC stores in the country. Compact stores Besides focusing on value and deliveries, Sapphire International has also reduced the size of Pizza Hut as well as KFC stores in the country. The brands earlier had large stores sized at 2500-3000 square feet, which have now been brought down to 1200-1500 sqft to make them more compact. “We inherited large stores but in the last four five years we have reduced the size of our stores,” said Purohit. “In a 1500 sqft store, we can seat 40-45 people; ideal for a neighborhood restaurant and we are also able to cater to delivery, dine-in and take away and improve accessibility,” he added. The company shared the group CEO, now spends slightly more than Rs 1.7-1.8 crore on setting up of a KFC store in India. Innovation, according to Purohit, is the third strategic move to bring the brand at par with its competitors. The company in the last few years has launched new pizza variants such as Momo Mia!Pizza to meet the taste palate of Indian consumers. Purohit also ruled out chances of consolidation of the business or an exit by founder-promoters and said Yum! Brands intends to continue to have two franchisees in the Indian market. The Sapphire Foods’ has proved its strategy in the Indian market, which is evident through its various metrics, he added. “In FY20, our operating EBITDA was 5 percent, today, it's 11.5 percent. Our net profit was negative 12 percent and today it's 3 percent. So, this execution mindset and governance have vindicated Yum! Brand’s decision to have two franchisee models in India,” he added."
16,Bombay HC rules in favour of HUL in Sebamed advertisement case,companies," The Bombay High Court on June 17 ruled in favour of Hindustan Unilever Limited and granted it complete relief in the case concerning the advertisements of German personal care brand Sebamed, the Business Line reported. A bench led by Justice AK Menon said, “Sebamed is restrained from further infringing on the brands owned by HUL.” HUL was quoted as saying: “The Honourable Bombay High Court has ruled Sebamed’s entire campaign—based on the pH value of soap, comparing it to Dove, Pears, and Lux—as disparaging. In its order on the application, the Court passed an injunction restraining Sebamed from airing the advertisement in any manner.” It added: “The ruling reaffirms that the advertisement campaign by Sebamed denigrated HUL’s brands and misled consumers on the basis of pH, which is just one of the many parameters that go into manufacturing soap.” According to the report, HUL had filed a petition after Sebamed, in an advertisement launched in January 2021, had drawn a parallel between its soaps, namely, Dove, Lux, and Pears, and their detergent bars. The Sebamed print ad campaign read: “Did you know the pH of Lux is the same as Rin?” Hindustan Unilever had retorted with an advertisement stating that the body soap bar is recommended by dermatologists. HUL had prayed before the Bombay High Court that Sebamed be restrained from using any content to promote its brand while disparaging Hindustan Unilever. In response, Sebamed had petitioned that its soap bars were better than that of HUL’s."
17,Explained: Revlon goes bankrupt. What went wrong with the cosmetics giant?,companies," Revlon Inc, known for its lipsticks and nail polishes, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US as it struggles with a huge debt load and supply chain constraints in the wake of the global container shortage. The bankruptcy protection will enable it to strategically reorganise its legacy capital structure and improve its long-term outlook, especially amid liquidity constraints brought on by continued global challenges, including supply chain disruption and rising inflation, said the cosmetics giant. Revlon, according to the court filing, has a total debt of $3.7 billion, while its listed assets stand at $2.3 billion. The company said it expects to receive $575 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing lender base, which in addition to its existing working capital facility, will provide liquidity to support day-to-day operations. Here’s a rundown on Revlon’s journey so far, why it is grappling with supply-chain issues, and what went wrong with the company. How big is Revlon in the US and the world? Founded in 1932 in New York City, Revlon products are sold in over 150 countries. The company reported net revenue of $2.08 billion in 2021. Besides Revlon, the company also sells skincare and fragrance products under the Elizabeth Arden brand, which is positioned in the premium segment. Revlon’s business is divided into four major groups—Revlon, Elizabeth Arden, fragrance segment that houses perfume brands like Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears, etc., and portfolio segment which includes brands like Crew, Almay, etc. According to a report by the company, Revlon contributed 35 percent of its total revenue in FY21, Elizabeth Arden had a 26 percent share in its turnover during the period, while the fragrance and portfolio segments contributed 19 percent and 20 percent, respectively. According to data from Euromonitor, Nielsen and Kline, Revlon is among the top three global mass cosmetics brands, while hair colour products under Revlon are highest-selling in the US. Why did the company file for bankruptcy? Revlon started by selling nail polishes in 1932 and surged over the years to become a household name in the US and globally. The company was acquired by MacAndrews & Forbes in 1985 and went public in 1996. Of late, however, the company has been unable to keep up with the rapidly changing cosmetics market as several new players entered the segment. The US company had reported net losses of $206.90 million in FY21, while its total debt as it filed for bankruptcy stood at $3.7 billion. The company sales, too, according to filings with the stock exchanges, fell by 22 percent from $2.69 billion in 2017 to $2.08 billion in 2021. While Revlon’s debt had been mounting, a challenging operating environment due to inflation added to its woes. Even as the company was grappling with mounting debt, it was hit by global supply chain issues, which further burned its capital as costs climbed up. The bankruptcy declaration will help the company reorganize its capital structure and revive its fortune. According to Debra Perelman, Revlon's president and chief executive officer, while the consumer demand for Revlon’s products remains strong, its challenging capital structure has limited the company’s ability to navigate macro-economic issues to meet this demand. “By addressing these complex legacy debt constraints, we expect to be able to simplify our capital structure and significantly reduce our debt, enabling us to unlock the full potential of our globally recognized brands,” she said. None of Revlon’s international operating subsidiaries are included in bankruptcy proceedings, except Canada and the U.K. How supply chain issues contributed to Revlon’s woes? Consumer goods companies, globally, are struggling with a shortage of key materials, and high inputs and freight costs. While the trigger for the supply chain disruptions was the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war and lockdown in China have worsened the situation. According to Revlon, supply chain dynamics changed significantly as its vendors’ capacities were constrained due to their own supply chain issues as well as strong demand. “Given our poor payment performance, vendors became much less tolerant of late payments. As the past dues increased, the vendor’s intolerance amplified the already challenging macro supply chain landscape and severely brought down service levels that were recovering in Q1 of 2022,” said a statement by the company. “A lockdown in China which began in the first quarter, as well as the continued shortage of key chemicals and components, further aggravated the situation,” it added. The supply chain troubles were mentioned by the company in its bankruptcy filing too, which said that the vendors who gave it a leeway of 75 days for payment, began asking for advances for new orders in the wake of the shortages. What’s the way ahead? The company’s management team will continue to run the business even as it goes through bankruptcy proceedings."

The company had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 287 crore in the January-March quarter of the 2020-21 fiscal."
20,Sequoia India grapples with fallout from governance snafus,companies," Sequoia Capital's India partners, caught out early this year by governance scandals at startup companies in its portfolio, assured investors at an April meeting in London that these ""lowlights"" were mostly behind it, according to three people familiar with the discussions. But two months later, Sequoia, a major venture capital player in India, is still grappling with complaints from startups about damaged trust and with a defamation lawsuit by a former general counsel, while the closing of a $2.8 billion fund was delayed due to a governance issue. Sequoia has acknowledged it faces governance-related challenges in India. Two sources familiar with the company's thinking said it had already made specific changes in governance practices, after an unusually frank blog post on April 17 by Sequoia that said it was reflecting on recent incidents and would impose stricter checks and requirements at the startups it funds. Grumbling nevertheless persists, including among many India startups not ensnared by scandals but concerned by them, highlighting the public relations headache for the company as it shores up its position in the country. The Silicon Valley firm has invested $5.5 billion in India and, since 2017, has struck more than 400 deals, far surpassing U.S.-based rivals like Accel and Lightspeed, data from Venture Intelligence shows. ""As an entrepreneur you raise money from Sequoia because of their reputation to work with founders closely,"" said one CEO of a Sequoia-funded startup, who declined to be named to avoid damaging relationships. He was among a dozen startups with funding and board representation from Sequoia who said the company had not kept them in the loop about governance-related issues that made headlines in India – and who worried that the incidents could reflect upon them as well. They declined to be identified. Sequoia did not respond to Reuters queries for this article. The first major sign of governance problems this year at Sequoia-funded startups emerged in January, when digital payments provider BharatPe launched a probe that eventually led to the sacking of several employees and findings of vendor malpractice. Three months later, Singapore-based fashion startup Zilingo said it had suspended its 30-year-old CEO and cofounder Ankiti Bose, a former Sequoia analyst, over suspected financial irregularities. She was later dismissed in what Bose has said was a wrongful termination. The people familiar with the April London meeting said Sequoia's investors did not indicate particular concern or waning support for its work in India due to the incidents, but it still faced further fallout later. In May, Sequoia wrote to some of its investors that it was delaying $2.8 billion in new India and Southeast Asia funds over ongoing governance concerns at an Indian portfolio company, according to two sources and an email seen by Reuters. The company did not comment at that time, although it announced this week that the fund had successfully closed. And this month, Sandeep Kapoor, Sequoia's in-house general counsel in India for nearly nine years until 2019, included the company in a defamation lawsuit against media companies that reported on a leaked Sequoia email of June 2. Kapoor's firm, Algo Legal, said in a press statement that the email, sent to Sequoia's portfolio companies, had made baseless references to ""concerning details"" about the firm and was harming its interests. The law firm said in its court filing that Sequoia was its top client in billings, but the U.S. venture capital firm had terminated its engagement with it in January. Kapoor declined to comment while the matter was before a judge. Sequoia in the first court hearing of the case last week sought time to respond to the allegations. The case is next set to be heard on June 18. India's startup sector had a blockbuster year in 2021 with $35 billion in fund raising, according to Venture Intelligence, but the boom has since subsided and governance problems are now cropping up at a number of startups. ""It is unfortunate for Sequoia … but the problem was systemic,"" said Anirudh Damani, managing partner at India's Artha Venture Fund. According to the sources familiar with Sequoia's thinking, the company believes it was careful with due diligence during the startup boom but it is now further bolstering its efforts on startups' governance training, whistleblower policies, audits and controls, as well as communications with portfolio companies. As part of stricter checks, Sequoia wants to ensure that its well-funded investee firms have a ""very strong CFO"" and that startups complete financial audits in time, said one of the sources. Another source familiar with the matter said Sequoia representatives had affirmed its commitment to investing in India and to corporate governance in a meeting earlier this month with India Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman."

23,"CBI charge sheet against Hanung Toys, promoters in Rs 2040 Crore bank loan fraud case",companies," The CBI has filed a charge sheet against Hanung Toys and Textiles Ltd and others including its promoters and directors for allegedly defrauding a consortium of 12 banks under Punjab National Bank to the tune of Rs 2040.63 crore, officials said Thursday. Besides promoters and directors Ashok Kumar Bansal and Anju Bansal, the agency has also listed associate persons Rishu Agarwal, Manoj Kumar Garg and Kali Kant Jha, statutory auditor Piyush Jain and company secretary Arvind Kumar Gupta in the charge sheet. After nearly two years of probe, the CBI has found that the accused allegedly manipulated account books ""by suppressing the actual derivative loss and made false financial statements across the years, from year 2008-2013"" to project an inflated financial health of the company, the officials said. ""It was further alleged that the quantum of suppressed derivative loss were malafidely and incorrectly reflected as non-existent debtors as well as stock in its books of accounts, thereby resulting into excess borrowing of Rs. 478.35 crore (approx) from the consortium banks,"" CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said in a statement. The company, which was one of the largest exporters of stuffed toys having some top international retail chains as its customers, ""inflated its turnover by entering into non-genuine transactions with certain parties"", the agency alleged in its charge sheet filed recently before a special CBI court. ""These trades were allegedly done in circular transactions amounting to Rs. 560 crore (approx) in order to siphon money from the banks and diverted the funds for personal gains/benefits of the directors and promoters of the said company,"" Joshi said. Circular transactions are sham transactions between related companies of a single group. The CBI has kept the probe open to investigate further, the officials said. The accounts of the company, a major supplier to global toys and home furnishing megastores in Europe, had turned non-performing assets during 2013-15, the bank had alleged in its complaint which was incorporated into a CBI FIR registered on September 25, 2020. According to a forensic audit, the company had indulged in fraud in its business transactions, it had alleged. The audit spotted differences in the figures of receivables, stocks and payables between the annual report and the stock audit report, signalling fabrication of the book of accounts, the bank had said. The amount disclosed in the account books of the company and those of the creditors are not different, indicating fabrication of accounts, it added."

0,Lockdowns in China adversely impact Tata Motors' supply chains,companies," The recent lockdowns in China have adversely impacted Tata Motors' supply chains as its suppliers are unable to deliver products and it could be forced to stop production in some or all of its plants if it is unable to ensure the supply of critical parts from the country, according to the company's annual report for FY22. The homegrown auto major has apprehensions that the ongoing global semiconductor shortage may impact it ""more pronouncedly"" than its competitors, who may have a greater level of buying power with suppliers or have a different range of features in their vehicles that are dependent on semiconductors. ""Recent lockdowns in parts of China as the government pursues a strategy of containing the spread of COVID-19 are adversely impacting our supply chains as our suppliers are unable to produce or deliver products to us,"" Tata Motors said in the report. Similarly, it said, ""we are also witnessing a temporary decrease in demand. These lockdowns have also led to some dealerships in some regions of China to temporarily close, which may have an adverse impact upon our sales outlook in fiscal 2023"". In its elaboration of risk factors, Tata Motors further said, ""If we are unable to ensure a supply of critical parts from China for production, we may be forced to stop production in some or all of our plants, which will have a significantly negative impact on our cash flow in the future"". ""We are witnessing certain supply chain disruptions as a result of China's lockdowns and dealership closures possibly resulting in negative EBIT and negative free cash flows in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for Jaguar Land Rover while our domestic business is also likely to witness a negative impact on financial performance,"" it added. On the ongoing shortage in the supply of semiconductors, Tata Motors said it has ""impacted and continues to impact our production schedules and our ability to meet the demand for some of our vehicles"". Such shortages that affect the entire automotive industry, it said, ""may impact us more pronouncedly than our competitors as they may have a greater level of buying power with suppliers or have a different range of features on their vehicles that are dependent on semiconductors, as well as impact our ability to divert the supplies on lower-end models, in which our competitors exclusively operate or for which our competitors are able to better manage supplies"". The company, however, said production schedules continue to be actively managed by the management in line with the availability of semiconductors and vehicle margin. ""Along with supply chain uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and sudden factory shutdowns due to natural disasters at major semiconductor production sites worldwide, longer-term trends, such as a general rise in demand in the automotive sector competing with other rapidly growing industries for semiconductor manufacturing capacity and structural issues within the semiconductor supplier landscape have complicated our ability to secure sufficient supply,"" it added. Stating that there can be no assurance that it will be able to source alternative supplies of semiconductors or that such alternative supplies of semiconductors will be readily available, Tata Motors said, ""The shortage of semiconductors has and is likely to continue to impact us in the near future"". If the shortages continue for a prolonged time, Tata Motors said its ""production levels may be affected, which would materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations"". ""In addition, the shortage of semiconductors could also have an adverse impact on the implementation of Jaguar Land Rover's Reimagine strategy to expand into EVs, which may contain a higher level of semiconductors than that used in conventional vehicles,"" the company added. The shortage of semiconductors could also increase car prices, which could negatively affect customer demand in the future should other companies be able to increase supply in the future. Furthermore, the extended delivery times of new cars could cause an increase in cancellations by customers, it added. Tata Motors further said, ""While we expect semiconductor supply to continue to gradually improve throughout fiscal 2023, there is no assurance that this will be the case and while the supply of semiconductors remains constrained, we may be more susceptible to supply-driven shocks in the future"". While the company continues to take measures to partially mitigate the impact of semiconductor supply shortages, including engaging in discussions with leading component suppliers and chip producers and prioritising the production of higher-margin vehicles, the company said, ""there can be no assurance that such measures will provide significant mitigation"". Tata Motors also said the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have an impact on its business and the results of operations. ""In Fiscal 2022, Jaguar Land Rover recorded 43 million pounds in relation to customer liabilities arising from sanctions imposed against Russia by countries, preventing the shipment of vehicles and certain parts to the market,"" the report said. "" The company's British arm Jaguar Land Rover over the past three fiscal years earned around 2.5 per cent of revenue on average each year from Russia and Ukraine, but it has suspended vehicle exports to Russia to comply with recent export restrictions. As of the date, Tata Motors said, Jaguar Land Rover continues to import a restricted range of safety-related parts to Russia for the repair of vehicles in the market in compliance with relevant sanctions and export control measures in place. While the impact of the conflict on production volume has been limited during fiscal 2022 as a result of active management of the parts supply chain, the company said."
1,Adani group's debt up 40% to Rs 2.21 lakh crore in FY22; Adani Enterprises sees highest rise,companies," Among the group entities, Adani Power and Adani Wilmar saw a decrease in their borrowings. Adani Power’s borrowing during the financial year 2021-22 stood at Rs 48,796 crore, a fall of 6.9 per cent as compared with Rs 52,411 crore a year ago. Adani Wilmar witnessed a drop of 12.9 per cent in its borrowing to Rs 2,568 crore in 2021-22, against Rs 2,950 crore in the previous financial year, according to the data. Adani Green Energy’s borrowing during the financial year increased 118.6 per cent to Rs 52,188 crore, compared with Rs 23,874 crore in 2020-21. The debt of Adani Ports and SEZ rose 32.1 per cent to Rs 45,453 crore, from Rs 34,401 crore a year ago. Adani Transmission saw an increase of 10.6 per cent to Rs 29,815 crore as compared with Rs 26,961 crore in the previous year, whereas Adani Total Gas’ borrowing jumped 103.9 per cent to Rs 995 crore in 2021-22 from Rs 488 crore a year ago, the data showed. The overall borrowing for the group combined stood at Rs 2,20,838 crore during the financial year 2021-22, a jump of 40.5 per cent as against Rs 1,57,137 crore a year ago, according to The Morning Context data. The group’s gross debt-to-equity ratio was at a four-year high of 2.36 at the end of March, an increase over 2.02 a year ago and a low of 1.98 at the end of FY19. Recently, during an analyst call following the March 2022 quarter results, Adani Enterprises Chief Financial Officer Robbie Singh said, “As our established businesses continue to sustain long-term growth, we are making significant progress in attractive incubation pipeline comprising of Adani new industries, airports, roads, data center businesses which will further accelerate value creation for our shareholders. While the growth story continues, validating our efficient capital management program, AEL credit rating has been upgraded to A+ for long-term credit lines and to A1+ highest rating for short-term credit facility by CARE ratings."" During earnings call in February, Adani Enterprises had said they were comfortable with the current leverage and did not expect their debt-Ebitda to exceed their internal target of 5.5x. Conventional wisdom would indicate even a target of 5.5x represents excess leverage. The company maintains its current debt-Ebitda is around 4x — based on internal estimates, not actuals. Gautam Adani has been on a diversification spree in the past few months. It recently bagged ACC and Ambuja Cement from Holcim for $10.5 billion (about Rs 80,800 crore). It is also entering the media business with AMG Media Networks."
2,Edtech unicorn Upgrad doubles valuation to $2.25 billion,companies," An education technology unicorn built by a cable TV-era entrepreneur almost doubled its valuation after raising $225 million in fresh funding, balking a frosty global venture capital environment. India’s UpGrad Education Pvt, founded by Ronnie Screwvala, increased its valuation to $2.25 billion in the round that included billionaire James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems LLC and US testing and assessment provider Educational Testing Service, according to a person familiar with the deal. ETS develops and administers standardized tests including the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The family offices of Indian billionaires Lakshmi Mittal of steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA and Sunil Bharti Mittal of telecom operator Bharti Airtel participated in the round, as did existing investors including Temasek Holdings Pte, said the person who asked not to be identified as the details are confidential. UpGrad’s fundraising bucks the trend. Indian edtech startups, particularly those in the K-12 segment, have shuttered operations, fired employees or curtailed expansion plans, after a temporary boost from pandemic-induced school closures. Venture capital investments globally have declined as technology valuations have suffered this year. India’s higher-education and “upskilling” startups, the niche UpGrad is in, have fared better by catering to older customers seeking expertise, an additional degree or help to crack the ultra-competitive entry tests for India’s elite engineering, medical and business schools. “India will write the global higher-edtech story,” Screwvala, the company’s chairman, said over a video call. “There’s an insatiable global appetite for upskilling and upgrading to diplomas, degrees and doctorates, all of which have measurable outcomes such as a new job, a raise or a promotion.” Screwvala, 65, confirmed the funding amount but declined to comment on the valuation or investors. An email sent to an UpGrad spokeswoman elicited no response. The funding round is set to increase by a further $100 million during a second close at a higher valuation, said the person familiar with the plans. Screwvala built a trend-setting cable-TV company in India in the 1980s, turning it into a unicorn that was acquired by Walt Disney Co. His latest startup raised capital from Temasek and others a year ago at a valuation of $1.2 billion. UpGrad is targeting $500 million in gross revenue in the year ending in March 2023, the founder said. College students and working professionals in India will account for four-fifths of that, but in about three years, domestic and international sales will even out, he said. The Mumbai-based company spans several segments, from test prep to study abroad, and undergrad degrees to campus courses in 250 universities. Its offerings include finance, law, business and software for the 18-60 age group. Screwvala founded UpGrad in 2015 with Mayank Kumar and Phalgun Kompalli to offer short courses on entrepreneurship and data science. The founders combined own about 55% of the equity. In the financial year ending next March, an estimated 3 million learners will take UpGrad courses that run from a few months to a few years, and cost 50,000 rupees ($640) to 800,000 rupees. Besides India, the startup is growing rapidly in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Middle East."
3,Akasa Air takes delivery of first 737 Max aircraft from Boeing,companies," New airline Akasa Air on Thursday took delivery of the first 737 Max aircraft from Boeing in Seattle, USA, a statement said. Three months after Indian aviation regulator DGCA gave the green light to Max planes, Akasa Air had on November 26 last year signed a deal with Boeing to purchase 72 Max aircraft. Commenting on the successful delivery of first aircraft on Thursday, Vinay Dube, Founder, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Akasa Air, said, This is indeed a symbolic milestone in the journey of Akasa Air, bringing us one step closer to the process of obtaining our Air Operator's Permit (AOP) and leading to our commercial launch."" The airline, which is backed by ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and aviation veterans Vinay Dube and Aditya Ghosh, received the no-objection certificate from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in August 2021 to launch commercial flight operations."

5,Esports on TV: Nazara's NODWIN partners with Disney Star to air BGMI Masters series,companies," Nazara Technologies’ NODWIN Gaming is bringing esports to prime time television by launching the Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) Masters Series. Esports, which has seen its reach growing on digital platforms such as YouTube, is now making the transition to TV to widen its reach. Taking the Indian Premier League (IPL) route, the new series will air for 2-3 hours daily, starting 8:30 PM, from June 24 to July 17. NODWIN has joined hands with Disney Star to air the BGMI Masters Series on the Star Sports 2 channel in Hindi, Tamil and English. ""During the IPL media rights auction, we saw digital taking off. Digital’s cumulative value is higher than TV. But as an (esports) industry that lives on digital, we often don't find validation and legitimacy. As an industry we wanted to break the digital glass ceiling. We thought that if esports is a sport then why are we not sitting on a sports channel,"" Akshat Rathee, Co-founder and Managing Director, NODWIN Gaming, told Moneycontrol. Surge in popularity Esports, a growing sports category in India, is seeing increased acceptance, especially with its inclusion in the 2022 Asian Games. Esports viewership on digital media has touched 17 million. That figure is expected to surpass 85 million unique viewers in India by 2025, said a 2021 EY-FICCI report. In 2020, the Hindi-language broadcast of the PUBG Mobile World League, which was the last big tournament in Asia, had recorded 449,000 peak viewers, the highest so far. Along with viewership, the number of platforms on which viewers can watch esports is also expected to increase from 14 platforms in 2020 to over 20 platforms by 2025. And TV now gets added to the list. Advertising and sponsorship plans With more viewers, the esports industry is also targeting more brands. Over 50 brands, including prominent national ones such as Airtel, Bookmyshow.com, Flipkart, Monster Energy Drinks, Asus, Redbull and Yes Bank have ventured into esports over the past few years, the report cited above noted. More brands will be added to the list for the BGMI Master Series TV broadcast as 15 sponsors are likely to come on board. NODWIN is already in the finalisation stage with 10, said Rathee. ""The first season is sponsorship-led. That’s why we are trying not to sell a lot of ad inventory and keeping it for sponsors and sponsorship packages,” he added. Rathee also said that in the three-hour window when esports games will air on TV, 30-40 minutes of ad inventory will be made available. The gaming company also said that there are ad slots across the Star network, including the ongoing India versus South Africa cricket series and that they are looking to have ad rates that are second only to India cricket. Cricket India matches on TV attract ad rates in the range of Rs 1–1.5 lakh, according to marketers. Rathee said that Star's talks with advertisers for the esports property on TV has shown that brands targeting men, such as shaving brands and those focusing on young adults, are interested to get on board along with telcos and car manufacturers. While esports is all set to go deeper into the India market with TV broadcasts, for Disney Star, this property comes at a time when the network has only won TV rights for the IPL and lost three others, including the consolidated digital and global rights."
6,Glenmark Pharma launches asthma drug Indamet,companies," Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Thursday said it has launched a novel fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug in the country for patients with uncontrolled asthma. The Mumbai-based drug major has launched - Indacaterol + Mometasone FDC under the brand name Indamet. The drug will be available in three strengths with a fixed dose of Indacaterol 150 mcg and variable doses of Mometasone 80 mcg, 160 mcg and 320 mcg to be taken once daily. ""Respiratory is a key focus area for Glenmark, and the company leads from the front in providing access to the latest treatment options to patients. ""We are proud to introduce this novel fixed-dose combination Indamet, which is the first of its kind in India, offering an affordable treatment option to both adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older suffering from uncontrolled asthma,"" Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Group Vice President & Head (India Formulations) Alok Malik said in a statement. The drug maker is the first company in India to market the FDC of Indacaterol, a long-acting beta-agonist and Mometasone Furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, approved by the DCGI (Drug Controller General of India), the company noted. Asthma affects more than 34 million people in India, causing thousands of deaths every year. According to the Global Burden of Disease report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), asthma accounted for 27.9 per cent of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Indians, causing 3 times higher mortality and 2 times higher DALYs compared to the global proportion of asthma."
7,"Minimum 10-15% increase in airfares must due to ATF price increase, rupee slide: SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh",companies," The sharp increase in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices and the depreciation of the rupee have left the domestic airlines with no choice but to immediately raise airfares, said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, on Thursday. A minimum 10-15 per cent increase in air fares is required to ensure that cost of operations are better sustained, Singh said in a statement. ATF prices have increased by more than 120 per cent since June 2021. This massive increase is not sustainable and governments, central and state, need to take urgent action to reduce taxes on ATF that are amongst the highest in the world,"" he said. SpiceJet has in the last few months tried to absorb as much burden of this fuel price rise, which constitutes more than 50 per cent of our operational cost, as we could, he said."
8,Stelis Biopharma receives EU compliance certificate for two facilities,companies," Stelis Biopharma on June 16 announced that it had received the European Union Goods Manufacturing Practices (EU-GMP) compliance certificate from the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition, Hungary, for two of its manufacturing facilities. The company plans to build a global biologics CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organisation) platform. Arun Kumar, founder, said, ""The approval from EU-GMP is a significant first step in our journey to build a global biologics CDMO platform that offers end-to-end solutions across modalities."" ""The last few quarters for our CDMO business have been eventful as we concluded various major contracts. These contracts have added new service revenues to our business and resulted in a commercial sales value of over $85 million in the peak year,"" he added. Stelis' facility based in Bengaluru leverages microbial and mammalian platforms for developing and commercialising biologics and biosimilars in multiple fill-finish formats, including cartridges, devices, and pre-filled syringes, liquid, and lyophilised vials. Stelis recently entered into international partnerships to manufacture biologics for diabetes, osteoporosis, and other therapeutic categories using mammalian and microbial systems from pre-clinical development through the commercialisation of biologics, biosimilars, and vaccines."

10,"Amazon pulled the plug on cricket, still believes in India",companies," Manish Tiwary had only been in his new job as head of Amazon.com Inc.’s India business a couple of months when he faced a weighty decision: How aggressively should the US e-commerce giant bid for media rights to the Indian Premier League? Securing digital streaming rights to the cricket tournament would be a huge coup, potentially luring hundreds of millions of viewers to Amazon. But Tiwary and his colleagues would have to bid against deep-pocketed giants like Reliance Industries Ltd. In a stunning move, Amazon pulled the plug before the auction started. Tiwary and senior management in Seattle decided those billions would be better spent on Amazon’s e-commerce business. “The final call was based on cost numbers,” said Tiwary, in one of his first interviews since taking over as country head, on the 27th floor of Amazon’s India headquarters in the northwestern neighborhood of Yeshwanthpur in Bangalore. It’s a sign of the tough calls ahead for the 52-year-old former Unilever Plc executive, who took on his current role in February. The country of nearly 1.4 billion people may be Amazon’s most promising long-term opportunity, but it’s also extremely challenging, with tough local rivals, a cantankerous government and unusually price-sensitive consumers. Amazon first began to target India under founder Jeff Bezos, who visited the country regularly and hob-nobbed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The company has invested more than $6.5 billion in India, hired 110,000 employees and built 60 warehouses to expand its reach in the country. Tiwary anticipates the next stage of growth will come from pushing beyond India’s big cities to what’s known as Bharat, the less affluent, non-English speaking people in rural areas. He expects to add the next 100 million shoppers from this effort. “I want Amazon to grow with India,” Tiwary said. “India is forecast to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world.” India’s e-commerce market is projected to swell to $350 billion by 2030, growing at a clip of about 23% as hundreds of millions of first-time smartphone users access the internet. That’s drawn competition from giants like Reliance to Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, as well as a flock of startups. Tiwary maintains there is room for several rivals to succeed given that only a few percent of the country’s $1 trillion retail market has moved online. “At less than 3% online retail penetration, the last thing I’d worry about is competition,” he said. “Sellers and shoppers have both begun seeing value in online retail.” His strategy for pushing beyond India’s big cities is a combination of technology and marketing. Central to it will be what Tiwary calls “Smart Commerce,” an initiative announced last month to help small merchants get online. The company has succeeded in getting about a million sellers on board so far, but that’s a fraction of the total. “If the 13 million or more small businesses are digitized, online shopping can reach every corner of India,” said Tiwary, who during his two decades at Unilever worked in places from Thailand and Vietnam to India and Dubai. He also thinks it’s critical to let more shoppers tap Amazon by voice, including with local languages. So the company’s engineers are enhancing app features to enable such purchases. It’s also expanding into buy-now-pay-later, an increasingly popular way to offer customers credit with no need for a credit or debit card. His marketing strategy couldn’t be more different from that of Reliance, the sprawling conglomerate led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. A joint venture backed by Reliance won the rights to show the Indian Premier League cricket matches online for 238 billion rupees ($3.05 billion). Tiwary is going to focus Amazon’s attention on developing local influencers to help market to Bharat customers. These aren’t stars like Kim Kardashian or Addison Rae. Instead, they’re homemakers like Kajal Srivastava from Deoghar in the state of Jharkhand or students like Ahmad Zahid from Kashmir who unbox and showcase products like affordable sports shoes, memory foam pillows or the latest instant curry concoction."
11,Airbus A350 jet deal on horizon for Tata-owned Air India,companies," Air India Ltd. is polling pilots on whether they want to be trained to fly Airbus SE A350 jets, indicating that it intends to operate the model as it looks to renew its widebody fleet under new owner Tata Group. The airline may introduce the A350 by the first quarter of 2023, according to a letter sent to senior cockpit crew and seen by Bloomberg News. Pilots must respond to the offer by June 20, and those who accept will be ineligible for training on another aircraft type for two years, the letter said. Air India is looking to order around 20 A350s, people familiar with the matter said. One option would be to take on jets initially destined for Russian carrier Aeroflot that Airbus can no longer deliver due to sanctions, as well as Qatar Airways planes that the airline isn’t taking due to a dispute with the manufacturer over paint quality. Bloomberg News reported earlier that talks were ongoing for narrowbody aircraft as well, including Airbus and Boeing Co.’s workhorse models. The deal may involve as many as 50 A350 jets and 100 A321neo aircraft, the Business Standard newspaper reported citing sources it didn’t identify. An Airbus spokesman said the company is always talking to existing and potential customers, while declining to comment further. A representative for Tata didn’t immediately respond outside of usual office hours. Air India could operate the A350 on flights to the US, which it currently serves with Boeing Co. 777s and 787-8s, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. The A350 order would be worth more than $6 billion based on list prices, before traditional industry discounts. Boeing jets could also factor into an order. Bloomberg reported in February that Air India was in talks with Airbus and Boeing about a raft of new planes including A350-900s and 787-9s after Tata won control of the former state-owned company and embarked on a fleet-modernization plan. Once known for its premium services and advertisements featuring Bollywood stars, the airline still has lucrative landing slots at most major airports, but it faces competition from foreign airlines with non-stop services to India and carriers that fly via hubs in the Middle East. Tata, which now owns four airline brands, including the local affiliates of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and AirAsia Group Bhd., is widely expected to consolidate the businesses. It already got antitrust approvals for Air India to take over AirAsia India."
12,Apple’s $2 Trillion market valuation on shaky ground,companies," After briefly surpassing $3 trillion in January, the iPhone maker has lost more than $800 billion in capitalization as tech stocks plunged. With concern growing that the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases could tip the US into recession, the $2 trillion milestone is looking precarious. Apple closed Tuesday at $2.15 trillion.  “In the same way that Apple benefited from the Fed-fueled bull market, it will suffer as the low interest rate and quantitative easing subsidies fade,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer at investment research firm New Constructs. Economists predict the Fed will raise interest rates Wednesday by at least half a percentage point, with some predicting a 0.75-point increase in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected inflation data. Further increases are expected this year. All of that could deepen the selloff in tech stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates as they weigh on the current valuation of companies’ future profits. The FAANG cohort -- Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- were poster children of the two-year bull market, rallying at breakneck speed to scale historic valuations. That quickly evaporated this year with the group losing a combined $2.6 trillion in market value as investors fled from growth names for safer assets. Amazon is also close to falling below $1 trillion.  Analysts have grown cautious, too. Over the past three months, they’ve cut their estimates for Apple’s fiscal third-quarter earnings by 7.8%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue projections are down about 4.2% over the same period. The stock also has the lowest share of analyst buy ratings in more than a year. KeyBanc Capital Markets sees signs of softer US demand, citing credit card data spending. Others have raised concerns about the pace of revenue growth at the company’s App Store, with Morgan Stanley adding that this poses risks to its estimates for Apple’s Services business. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Apple derived 18.7% of its fiscal 2021 revenue and more than 30% of gross profit from services. Apple’s stock woes have intensified this year with a 24% slump and Saudi Aramco snatching its title as the world’s most valuable company. Setting aside the headwinds that have broadly pressured tech stocks -- rising interest rates, slowing economic growth and soaring inflation -- the tech giant is also facing supply constraints related to Covid restrictions in China. In April, it warned that it could take a $4 billion to $8 billion hit to revenues for the current quarter. History shows that it can take years for technology stocks to climb back to the highs set in raging bull markets, assuming they ever do. Cisco Systems Inc., a star of the late 1990s tech frenzy, is still 46% below its all-time peak  of March 2000. “I would say that if an investor under-owns these names, then this is an opportunity to add to positions,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, which has about $130 billion in assets. “However, there are always names that lead in some eras, but then it takes years for them to them to regain their record levels. Just because they will continue to grow, that doesn’t mean these names will regain their former leadership.”"
13,Mission is to take IPL to cricket fans in every part of India and around the world: Nita Ambani,companies," Viacom18’s acquisition of the consolidated digital rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches for 2023 to 2027 has shown that it is building the digital platforms of the future. After winning these rights, Viacom18 will make IPL available to every Indian in every part of India, including the 60 million FreeDish homes which today are not able to access this popular content, the company said in a statement. “Our mission is to take the joyful experience of IPL to cricket fans wherever they are - in every part of our country and around the world,” said Nita Ambani, Director, Reliance Industries Ltd. Viacom18 is a joint venture of Reliance Industries-owned Network18, through its subsidiary TV18, and Paramount Global. It recently entered into a strategic partnership transaction with Bodhi Tree Systems (a platform of Lupa Systems of James Murdoch and Uday Shankar). “Cricket and IPL personify the best of sport and the best of India, which is why we are proud to be deepening our association with this great game and this wonderful league,” said Ambani. Viacom18 paid Rs 50 crore per match for the Indian subcontinent streaming rights, Rs 33.24 crore for the Indian subcontinent special rights package, and Rs 1.45 crore for international rights in some regions. These include cricket-loving nations such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK. The digital rights for the subcontinent at Rs 23,758 crore have surpassed the TV rights acquired by Star for Rs 23,575 crore. The IPL rights mark Viacom18’s first major entry into cricket. This, along with the rights of other events such as the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, National Basketball Association (NBA), La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Abu Dhabi T10, and top ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and Badminton World Federation (BWF), makes Viacom18 and its platforms one of the largest sporting destinations in the country. What’s more, Viacom has state-of-the-art digital expertise to provide the best possible user experience to hundreds of millions of Indian and global consumers. The digital platforms utilise a combination of top-class content as well as digital prowess through big data analytics and predictive algorithms to offer contextualised and relevant content to each consumer, the company said in a statement. This also provides an exceptional opportunity for advertisers to reach a larger, younger, more relevant and highly-engaged audience. The targeting opportunities because of Viacom18’s strategic partnership with Jio, which has brought about a mobile data revolution in India, will be unparalleled. ""The Jio DNA in Reliance gives them the foresight and the conviction to stay with very long-tail customer acquisition strategies,"" said Utkarsh Sinha, Managing Director, Bexley advisors a boutique investment bank firm. Streaming viewership for IPL has been growing with the league registering 421 million viewers last year as compared to 375 million and 325 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively. The league's digital viewership is expected to see the highest growth with analysts estimating it to touch 523 million in 2023."
14,Chai Point’s growth ambition rides on vending machines,companies," Tea cafe chain Chai Point is betting on vending machines to power its growth into the largest tea and coffee retailer in India. Chai Point plans to launch tea and coffee vending machines targeting three sets of clientele grouped under myChaipersonal, myChai boxC and myChai bean to cup. MyChai personal vending machines will be installed at bakeries and myChai boxC at corporate offices. myChai bean to cup machines will dispense western coffees like cappuccino, americano and macchiato. “We have already installed over 4,000 vending machines and we aim to install 30,000 vending machines under each of these categories in the next three-four years,” founder and CEO Amuleek Bijral told Moneycontrol. “We see ourselves as a beverage platform and aspire to be one of the biggest tea and coffee beverage platforms. We want to make sure that predictable, high-quality tea and coffee are accessible to customers. That means that we have to reach customers through various channels,” Birjal added. Beyond retail Chai Point, which started in 2010 as a quick service restaurant serving tea, has been through some tumultuous times in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, like most cafe chains and eateries. The business-to-business (B2B) segment, which provided vending machines to corporate clients, was disrupted by office closures and offline retail stores were hit by closures. As the company emerges from the pandemic, it has homed in on four avenues of growth. Chai Point’s retail business, including deliveries, contributes 60 percent of its sales. The corporate business makes up 30 percent, and the direct-to-consumer segment and MyChai platform account for 5 percent each. According to filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Chai Point posted operating revenue of Rs 56 crore in the financial year 2021, a drop of over 70 percent from Rs 189 crore reported in FY20. The company is eying Rs 700 crore from the vending machine business alone in the next two-three years. “We have realised that in a country like India, building a consumer brand around tea and coffee cannot be just a retail channel play,” said Bijral. “We don't want to be bracketed by thinking that stores are the only approach or vending machine is the only approach,” he added. The bakery business is an immense opportunity, said Bijral. India had about 1 million independent bakeries that want to offer tea and coffee to their customers. “We are targeting only 3 percent of this pie at the moment,” he said. Coffee in the mix Chai Point will sell products like tea leaves and coffee beans required to make the beverages using its machines. According to Bijral, the company recovers the cost of its machine in 8-10 months. “Our business model is the consumables that go behind powering the machine, the same business model that we have deployed in our office channel, where again, we don't sell the machine but deploy the machine as a service,” he added. The company has also started serving coffee through these machines and will also be selling machines for dispensing western coffee, a pivot from its Unique Selling Proposition was “freshly brewed tea.” According to Bijral, the company’s target group of white-collar workers prefers to drink coffee as well as tea, and so it is now offering the beverage. The company started by introducing filter coffee about four years ago and now offers western brews too. Chai Point competes with QSR chains such as Chaayos and Chai Thela."

In comparison, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries — which houses nearly all its ventures — saw a 13.4 per cent rise in value to Rs 18.87 lakh crore, which helped it retain the top rankings in Burgundy Private Hurun India 500 rankings. Tata Consultancy Services came second at Rs 12.97 lakh crore despite a 0.9 per cent decline in value, and was followed by HDFC Bank, Infosys and ICICI Bank. Among the firms led by the Ahmedabad-based Gautam Adani, the valuation for Adani Green Energy rose the fastest at 139 per cent to Rs 4.50 lakh crore, which catapulted it to the sixth spot from 16th just six months ago, the report said. Adani Wilmar grew by nearly 190 per cent to Rs 66,427 crore and Adani Power reported a 157.8 per cent growth to Rs 66,185 crore, the report said, adding that the nine companies in the Adani group combined together saw a 88.1 per cent surge in their value to Rs 17.6 lakh crore and account for 7.6 per cent of the top 500 companies now. ""The Adani Group companies in the review period increased their value by 88.1 per cent, as against an increase of just 2 per cent by the top 500 companies,"" the report said. Value of the top 500 companies in India increased marginally by 2 per cent to Rs 232 lakh crore from Rs 221 lakh crore as on October 30, 2021, it said. Despite the marginal growth, companies in the list, which is a compilation of non-state owned companies, performed better than those in the 30-share BSE Sensex (down 4 per cent) or the Nasdaq (down 17 per cent), it said. ""Indian companies have weathered the storm and performed better than their global peers. It shows the inherent strength and depth of the Indian economy,"" Hurun India's managing director and chief researcher Anas Rahman Junaid said.

The highest gain was by Vedant Fashions with a growth in valuation of 313.9 per cent, followed by Adani Wilmar and Billdesk at 172.9 per cent, it said. Banking sector rivals ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank displayed a trend of a decline in value with the second largest lender restricting the decline to 3.9 per cent, as against an over 15 per cent decline for HDFC Bank. The minimum valuation to make it into the top-500 valuation list was Rs 5,800 crore or USD 760 million, and companies in the list came from 15 states led by Maharashtra. Mumbai alone is home to 159 of the companies, followed by Bengaluru at 59 and Gurugram at 38."
16,"Recent dip in cement demand is temporary, says Anil Singhvi of Shree Digvijay Cement",companies," The recent dip in cement demand was a blip and things should start improving from here, Shree Digvijay Cement Ltd Executive Chairman Anil Singhvi has said. ""I think there was some confusion on account of some statements made by the government that along with the steel prices cement prices will correct or come down and I don't think there is any policy change which was warranting that. Also, steel prices corrected, they were expecting cement prices to also come down and that is where perhaps the demand got slowed down because they were not placing orders,” Singhvi said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 on June 15. Though crude and coal prices have been rising for the last two-three months, the cement industry had not passed even half the spike to customers. If fuel prices cool, the industry would see some better margins in a couple of months. Even though Ultratech Cement's capacity expansion plan made the street nervous, Singhvi expects a 7-8 percent rise in demand for cement in the fiscal year 2023. The demand was unlikely to go down even though Ultratech Cement was adding capacity and Adani Group had entered the sector. Ultratech Cement recently announced a capex plan of Rs 12,886 crore to increase capacity by 22.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) through brownfield and greenfield projects."
17,Adani Transmission's $700 million revolving facility gets 'green loan' tag,companies," Adani Transmission Limited (ATL) on Wednesday said its USD 700 million revolving loan facility has been tagged as 'green loan' by Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics, a Morningstar Company, provides analytical environmental, social and governance (ESG) research, ratings and data to institutional investors and companies. In a statement issued on Wednesday, ATL said its ""USD 700 million revolving facility has been tagged as green loan by Sustainalytics. This provides assurance on the green loan framework for the revolving facility."" A revolving loan facility is a flexible financing tool that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again. On receiving the green load tag, Anil Sardana, MD and CEO, ATL said ""ATL has been a signatory to energy compact goals as part of COP26 and the energy compact with the UN in November, 2021. ""This is the testament to the overall philosophy of ATL to facilitate transition to green energy by increasing the share of renewable power in the overall grid, in line with India's commitment on climate change."" In October 2021, the company in a regulatory filing had announced raising USD 700 million for its under-construction transmission asset portfolio through the definitive agreements signed with leading international banks. The revolving nature of the facility will help the company to achieve its goal of 20,000 ckt km (circuit kilometer) of transmission lines by 2022, ATL had said. The projects associated with the USD 700 million revolving facility are being implemented in Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Gujarat, the projects are part of the government's Green Energy Corridor Projects (GEC), dedicated to the evacuation and transmission of renewable energy."
18,Crayon Motors inks pact with Bounce Infinity to set up interoperated battery network,companies," Electric two-wheeler startup Crayon Motors and EV battery swapping network provider Bounce Infinity have teamed up to set up an interoperated battery network, a release said on Wednesday. The 'first-of-its-kind' tie-up will enable Crayon Motors' customers to buy an electric two or three-wheeler without a battery and instead use Bounce Infinity's 'Battery-as-a-Service' (BaaS) solution, which will be available at various locations, including at the EV maker's dealerships, the electric vehicle startup said in the release.

It has made significant investments in R&D to establish manufacturing plants for key components, such as motors, controllers, and prototypes."
19,"To take on IndiGo, the Tatas have no option but to merge Vistara with Air India",companies," At 04.55 am, two aircraft pushed back simultaneously at Delhi Airport. One was an Air India Boeing 787 and another was an AirAsia India A320. Both were bound for Kochi. Thirty-five minutes later, a Vistara aircraft pushed back to fly on the same route. Clearly, Campbell Wilson, the new CEO of Air India, will have his task cut out. There is a scope for improvement just about everywhere, but it will have to start with schedule integration. On the eve of Wilson starting his tenure, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the merger of AirAsia India with Air India, which paves the way for the merger of AirAsia India with AirIndia Express. While the Tata group and Singapore Airlines have both said that Vistara and Air India will continue to operate separately, reports indicate that all the airlines will be housed under one roof in Gurugram. So, while Vistara might continue as is for a while, there will still be synergy among the various carriers.  Pricing power in aviation comes from capacity. If an airline operates on a particular route with options to fly multiple times a day, it presents a better offering to the corporate market. For this to work, an airline needs to have frequencies spaced out across the day on most major sectors in the country. This is all the more important in a country like India, where over half the market is controlled by one carrier, IndiGo. Data exclusively shared by OAG Aviation for this article shows that IndiGo operates on 746 sectors, while Air India operates on 169, followed by Vistara with 104 sectors and AirAsia India with 90. Air India Express, which primarily serves international routes, operates on 14 domestic sectors. There are 222 sectors in the country in which Air India group airlines (including Vistara) and IndiGo both have a presence. But there are only 110 sectors where IndiGo is competing with either Air India, Air India Express and/or AirAsia India. There precisely lies the need for Air India to have Vistara under its wing, to compete with the market leader. AI, AI Express and AirAsia India: Not a potent combo to take on IndiGo A look at the top 20 routes in the country by frequency shows there is only one where IndiGo has fewer frequencies than Air India, Air India Express and AirAsia India combined. That sector is Mumbai-Goa-Mumbai. Air India Express being primarily an international carrier, there hardly is any overlap with IndiGo on domestic routes. That leaves Air India and AirAsia India to take the battle forward. The last eight years has seen IndiGo build a formidable presence against AirAsia India, leaving it in tatters on many sectors. Even after getting slots for flights on metro routes after the fall of Jet Airways, AirAsia India’s presence on them was skeletal as compared to IndiGo. With Air India’s cost structure, taking on IndiGo will come at a price that may not be affordable till the reorganisation is completed and cost controls are in place. The moment Vistara’s network is added to the mix, the Tata group airline combo pips IndiGo in terms of frequencies on 17 of the top 40 sectors in the country. This includes the lucrative Delhi-Mumbai and Mumbai-Delhi sectors, where the Tata group would have 40 percent more frequencies per week than IndiGo. The combine would also fare better on the next set of routes, such as Delhi-Bengaluru-Delhi and Mumbai-Bengaluru-Mumbai. Of the 169 sectors where Air India operates, it does not have IndiGo as a competitor only on 23. AirAsia India operates on 90 sectors, with only two sectors where it does not compete with IndiGo. Air India Express operates on 14 domestic sectors, most being position flights before international operations. Nine of them are without competition from IndiGo and in fact monopoly routes. Frequency denotes a presence in the market. Multiple frequencies a day helps capture a significant market and more importantly gives an airline pricing power to an extent, which is important in a cut-throat market like India. All of the calculations with Vistara as part of the Air India combine are hypothetical for now. Both the airline groups have publicly stated that a decision has not yet been taken on merging them but at the same time, the Tata group has made it clear that it wants to be a dominant force in this sector."
20,"SentinelOne plans to invest $50 million in India, launches Operations Centre in Bengaluru",companies," Cybersecurity company SentinelOne on Wednesday announced plans to invest USD 50 million in India as part of its ongoing global expansion, and targets expanding its talent base by 500 in the coming years. The company today launched its 'Operations Centre' in the city to help organisations in the broader region address the growing threat of cyberattacks. The Centre will deliver innovation, product development, threat research, and engineering, recruiting top talent to modernize cyberdefense, it said, as a key component to SentinelOne's India investment and build out, customer data will be stored in a local data center. SentinelOne's Bengaluru Operations Centre represents an investment in talent and technology to serve the local market and our global customer base, said SentinelOne Chief Technology Officer Ric Smith. ""The Centre's engineers and threat researchers will focus on cutting-edge cybersecurity innovations to address the exponentially growing threat landscape.

21,"Profitability, revenue forecasting more complex amid rapid technological disruption: Happiest Minds CFO ",companies," Profit and revenue forecasting has become more complex in the face of rapid technological change, making long-term contracts riskier, said Venkatraman Narayanan, Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of Happiest Minds Technologies. His remark came from the backdrop of rising attrition, exchange-rate volatility, and weak global cues affecting the information technology (IT) industry. “Profitability and revenue forecasting is becoming very complex, as complicated as weather forecasting,” Narayanan said in an episode of Life After Listing, a Moneycontrol series that focuses on the key changes for a company's management and founders/promoters after their company goes public. Because of fluctuations in the value of the rupee, attrition rising in high double digits, the Russia-Ukraine war, and COVID-19, among other factors, predicting profitability or growth is a lot more complex than it was earlier, Narayanan said. Happiest Minds posted one of the highest attrition rates in the IT industry in the last financial year when it soared to 22.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Changing contract negotiations Narayanan said less room for predictability has changed the way contracts are negotiated in the digital IT space. “Large million-dollar contracts earlier were safer as companies could predict the trends for the next five years,” he said. With rapid disruption in technology, the components of predictability are also changing now, making long-term contracts riskier. “If I sign on a long-term contract of let’s say $5 million, or $10 million, I only know what I can deliver in the next six months to 12 months because after that there is so much technology disruption. Do you want to lock yourself in for such a long term? So these are questions that are beginning to now surface,” said Narayanan. The conversation around how to approach new technologies has taken centre stage. “So on the technology front, we just spend time talking about what is Web 3.0. Did you miss the bus, you have to make sure that you pick the right technology because there is no dearth of the new technologies that are on offer.” Happiest Minds is focused on making ahead-of-time investments in emerging technologies, said Narayanan. Drone technology “We are making investments in Web 3.0...Process automation, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence-based solutions are other areas. One area which we really picked up on ahead of time was drones,” he said. Along those lines, Happiest Minds is helping the Indian government with the DigitalSky platform, a unified platform to track and trace all drones in the country. According to Narayanan, the company is among the first movers toward drone technology and is capable of taking it to the market. “We are playing a significant role in building the platform. The proof is in the delivery that we have done on DigitalSky and a few other projects.” Narayanan added: “Similarly, we have also been talking about AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality). We have taken a couple of them to our customers and we are working closely with them. Web 3.0, it’s in its early stage. We're making investments in it.”"

23,Shiprocket to acquire majority stake in Pickrr for $200 million,companies," E-commerce logistics SaaS company Shiprocket has inked a deal to acquire a majority stake in its competitor e-commerce platform Pickrr for about USD 200 million (about Rs 1,560 crore) in a mix of cash and equity transaction, the firms said in a joint statement. Shiprocket and Pickrr cater to India's burgeoning D2C (direct-to-customer) sector, where enterprises book order online and deliver it directly to customers. ""We are excited to have Pickrr as part of the Shiprocket family, combining the two largest platforms enabling direct commerce. Together, we will define the future of e-commerce enablement in India,"" Saahil Goel, co-founder and CEO of Shiprocket said in the statement. Established in 2017, Shiprocket started its journey by building a DIY technology stack focusing on social sellers and SMEs. ""The deal value is estimated at USD 200 million, comprising cash, stock and earn-out,"" the statement said. PIckrr was established in 2018. ""As we analysed what the acquisition of Pickrr could mean, we were certain that it would be mutually beneficial, not just for the two platforms, but the entire e-commerce logistics space."
24,Cement margins to crack despite rising demand: Fitch Ratings,companies," India's cement demand is expected to expand by mid to high single digits over the medium term (FY22) after a mid-teen comeback in the financial year ended March 2022, said a report by Fitch Ratings, a global capital markets research company. The report claims that if GDP growth is maintained, infrastructure and affordable housing get continuous push from the government, and corporate capex sees an improvement, growth across various construction end-markets will be strengthened. Moreover, Adani Group's deal to acquire Holcim’s business in India and become the second-largest cement manufacturer in India will enhance the competition in the industry, especially with the company's potentially more aggressive attitude to capacity expansion. By the report, industrywide utilisation will drop from 70% for FY22 to 65% as faster new capacity additions overtake demand growth, limiting pricing power amid anticipation that the sector would consolidate further. It is also expected that cement price increases will not be enough to offset the rise in energy prices since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. Cement makers' per-tonne margins will remain much lower in FY23 than in FY21, when reduced energy prices increased profit despite weaker demand due to the pandemic. Notwithstanding decreased profitability and plans for higher expansion capital, leading Indian cement companies' financial flexibility will be supported by their lowered financial leverage from FY20, the report claimed."

0,"Attrition to peak next quarter amid change in IT job trends, hiring patterns: Happiest Minds MD",companies," A massive talent crunch in the information technology (IT) industry is expected to peak in the next quarter before beginning to plateau and taper, says Venkatraman Narayanan, Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of Happiest Minds Technologies. Narayanan spoke against the backdrop of increased attrition in Happiest Minds and the IT industry as a whole. “I see the attrition problem picking up for maybe a quarter, and then it will plateau. And then like everything else, dip,” Narayanan said in an episode of Life After Listing, a Moneycontrol series that focuses on the key changes for a company's management and founders/promoters after their company goes public. Happiest Minds reported high attrition rates in the last financial year and the level has risen steadily. From 12.1 percent in FY21, it jumped to 17.8 percent in Q2 of FY22, 21.1 percent in Q3, and 22.7 percent in Q4. In fact, the whole IT industry saw attrition jumping in FY22 as startups snapped up tech talent, offering inflated salaries which induced employees to job-shop more aggressively. Sudden shift to digital Narayanan believes the rapid growth in demand for tech talent is on account of a sudden move in the IT industry towards digital technologies. “You have the traditional IT and the digital IT. Everybody is moving to digital IT. This whole transition of moving to digital will require a lot more supply, investments, and capabilities. So, there is a market of demand,” he added. With the IT industry growing at 11-14 percent a year, the sector’s revenue is projected to reach $350 billion by FY2026, according to a recent report by the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM). “Give or take another two years, it’s still rapid growth,” said Narayanan. Happiest Minds reported a 44.5 percent rise in net income to Rs 52 crore in the March quarter, on a 39 percent increase in revenue. The company generates revenues from three business units -- digital business services, product engineering services, and infrastructure management and security services. “The challenge here and now is the talent crunch. You see it because of this sudden (shift to digital) cutover. Whenever there is such a transition, which is so rapid, especially when it got accelerated because of COVID, you run into trouble,” added Narayanan. Changes in hiring patterns and job trends Narayanan believes that owing to a generational shift of mindset towards employment and changing dynamics between talent and recruiters, hiring has now become a collaborative exercise. “We have to change our hiring patterns, our hiring practices according to the needs of the day, and which is what I think our teams are doing today,” he said. For example, Narayanan said while the company needs digitally capable people, they don’t necessarily have to be engineers as long as they are trained by a finishing school in new digital capabilities. “If there are people with both attitude and aptitude, maybe a person who's a pure science graduate, they can get trained, ” he added. Happiest Minds added a net 940 employees, and 2,930 on a gross basis in FY22, taking its headcount to 4,168. It net-added only 147 in Q4 against plans to hire 300 fresh faces in each quarter. “Talent will get backfilled, but it will take time. I would say (for) one or two years, you will have this talent crunch,” Narayanan said. In September 2020, Happiest Minds raised Rs 702 crore via an initial share sale. The IT solution services provider debuted on the bourses at a bumper premium of 111.4 percent over its IPO price."
1,"LinkedIn, UN Women join hands to create employment opportunities for women",companies," LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, on Wednesday said it will invest USD 5,00,000 (Rs 3.88 crore) in partnership with UN Women to advance women's economic empowerment. The project will launch a pilot in Maharashtra to cultivate the digital, soft, and employability skills of 2,000 women and present them with a range of career-building opportunities through job fairs, mentoring sessions, and peer-to-peer networks, a statement said. The three-year regional collaboration will digitally upskill women, providing them greater access to jobs and equipping them to fully participate in the formal economy, it added. ''We are delighted to partner with UN Women to jointly work towards improving female representation and professional diversity across the region's workforce by investing in the upskilling and economic empowerment of women. By bringing women closer to the right skills and resources, we aspire to create a more equitable and all-inclusive talent landscape,'' said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn. The partnership will be guided by the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), a set of effective, actionable principles that guide businesses on how to promote gender equality and women's empowerment in the workplace, marketplace, and community. UN Women and LinkedIn will leverage the online platform and institutional expertise to convene partners to support women's economic empowerment. Together, they will hold joint advocacy campaigns and events, as well as convene key partners from their respective networks to achieve broadly equal opportunities and outcomes for women and men in the workplace. Additionally, UN Women will leverage its partnerships to offer young women foot-in-the-door opportunities across industries, with a focus on operating the LinkedIn platform and building connections. ''Access to quality education is critical to decent employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for women and girls. The aim of the LINK Women project, in partnership with LinkedIn, is to create a cadre of women who will acquire new digital and employability skills, leading to better jobs,"" said Susan Ferguson, Country Representative, UN Women India. A disproportionate number of women lack basic access to the Internet. Addressing gender-responsive technology policymaking in the Asia-Pacific region is crucial given that in Asia, 54.6 percent of men have access to the internet, compared to 41.3 percent of women, the statement said. Women and girls often do not have the same access to education, or type of education, as men and boys do, which sometimes leaves them with decreased digital skills, literacy, and consequentially fewer economic opportunities in an increasingly digital world.

The company will use the fresh capital to develop and implement the yield guarantee solution to improve the resilience of 1,00,000 smallholder farmers against climate risks and incentivise smart agricultural risk management practices, WRMS said in a statement. InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF), managed by the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management (FS), and financed by KfW Development Bank, signed a grant agreement with WRMS and INGEN Technologies, a data provider of weather stations, to co-fund the project development and implementation of the yield guarantee solution. The project also aims to scale up the yield guarantee solution for crops such as cotton, chili, paddy, wheat and potato. ""At WRMS, our aim is to build resilience of smallholder farmers by giving them equal opportunities to thrive. With this new association with InsuResilience Solutions Fund, we are now ready to further ramp up our SecuFarm services to the next level and support the smallholders to our maximum extent,"" Anuj Kumbhat, Founder & CEO of WRMS, said.

WRMS offers SecuFarm which is a sustainable farming solution for smallholders to provide them with farm level yield guarantee and an assured income. The solution guarantees farmers a benchmark yield, provided they follow the Package of Practice (PoP) shared with them on the SecuFarm app. ""If the actual yield is still below the benchmark yield due to any extreme weather attack or crop disease, the farmer is compensated by WRMS, in proportion to the shortfall,"" the statement said."
5,Tesla India policy executive quits after company puts entry plan on hold - sources,companies," A key executive who was leading Tesla's lobbying effort in India has resigned, weeks after the U.S. carmaker put on hold plans to sell electric cars in the South Asian nation, two sources aware of the matter told Reuters. Manuj Khurana, policy and business development executive at Tesla in India, was hired in March 2021 and played a key role in forming a domestic market-entry plan for the U.S. carmaker in the country. He lobbied the Indian government for more than a year to slash the import tax on electric cars to 40% from as high as 100%, a move Tesla said would allow it to test the market with imports from its production hubs like China before investing in a factory. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government insisted Tesla must first commit to manufacturing cars locally before it can offer any concessions. With talks deadlocked, Tesla put its plans to sell cars in India on hold, reassigned some of the domestic team and abandoned its search for showroom space. Neither Khurana, the company's first employee in India, nor Tesla responded to requests for comment. An email sent to Khurana generated an automated reply saying the address was no longer valid and future emails would not be received. ""Tesla's plans to launch in India right now are as good as dead,"" said one of the sources. The sources wished to remain anonymous because the resignation had not yet been made public. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Twitter last month that the company would not set up manufacturing in any location where it was not allowed first to sell and service cars. The carmaker has also shifted its focus to other markets in Southeast Asia, like nickel-rich Indonesia, where it is looking at a potential battery-related investment, as well as Thailand, where it recently registered a local unit to sell cars."

The global market for plant-based meat was estimated at USD 5.06 billion in 2021. It is predicted to increase at a CAGR of 19.3 percent between 2022 and 2030. The market is likely driven by increasing consumer interest in plant-based diets and heightened awareness of animal rights through various animal welfare organizations. The global market for plant-based meat was estimated at USD 5.06 billion in 2021. It is predicted to increase at a CAGR of 19.3 percent between 2022 and 2030. Talking about the plans, the founder, Mr. Suresh Raju, said, Veganism is becoming more popular among consumers for health and ethical reasons, while vegetarian ingredients are becoming more popular among customers who want to prevent animal cruelty and consume sustainable food. Since India closely follows the U.S. trends, we expect similar growth for plant-based meats in India. Plant-based meat is meat derived from plants. It is manufactured to taste, look, and feel like traditional meat from animal products. Plant-based meat is increasingly becoming a feature of the vegan diet, in which people live a vegetarian lifestyle free of animal products.

The imitation meat craze appears to be driven by a rising number of health-conscious and ethically aware people who choose to be vegetarian or vegan. In terms of calories alone, plant-based meat is better than animal-based meat. Vegans aren't the primary consumers of plant-based meats. Vegetarians, vegans, and persons who follow religious or cultural dietary prohibitions are increasingly turning to plant-based meats. Non-vegetarians and flexitarians wanting to lessen the environmental impact of meat production have expanded their appeal due to the global desire for sustainable diets. Because meat substitutes often mimic the texture, flavour, look, and chemical features of specific varieties of meat, it is also consumed by some converts to fulfil their meat cravings, explains Mr. Raju. What is unique about FitdayVeganMeat is that it is curated with the Indian palate & cuisine in mind. This imitation meat is made from soy and natural ingredients and may be used in various recipes. It can be used as fillings, pizza toppings, and gravy additions in any cuisine. Dishes like VeganMeat biryani, spaghetti, sandwiches, dosa, and momos, may be made using this plant-based meat.

The automaker has set up the panels at Jewar in Gautam Buddh Nagar district in UP, Kheri Kalan in Faridabad and Bhorikalan and Bhangrola in Gurugram districts of Haryana. The company said it has plans to extend this initiative to other community health care centres this year. The four Health Centres now have a combined 50 KW of captive solar power and after consuming power for their needs, these health centres can distribute excess power to the grid, thereby not only making a contribution to sustainable energy but also lower their respective energy bills, the company stated. ""Volvo is committed to sustainability and providing renewable and green energy to these health centres showcases our commitment. We have initially set up solar power plants at three centres and have plans to expand this to other Community Health Centres in these regions,"" Volvo Cars India Managing Director Jyoti Malhotra stated. These solar power panels lessens the centre's dependency on conventional energy thereby contributing to a lesser carbon footprint and making health services sustainable, he added. This initiative also reduces the cost of conventional energy as these health centres feed the excess of solar power to the grid, Malhotra said. The company is committed to being a pure electric car company globally by 2030 and has the ambition to be a climate neutral company by 2040."

12,Corporate India's hiring outlook for July-September most optimistic in 8 years: Survey,companies," India's job market looks optimistic with 63 per cent of companies planning to add more staff in next three months, in a bid to speed up the recovery process and sustain the economic growth, a survey said on Tuesday. According to the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, the labour market is indicating strong sentiments in third quarter (July-September) of 2022, with a Net Employment Outlook of 51 per cent, which is a record high in 8 years. Net Employment Outlook is derived by taking the percentage of employers anticipating total employment to increase and subtracting from this the percentage expecting to see a decrease in employment at their location in the next quarter. For September quarter, 63 per cent expect to increase their staffing levels, 12 per cent anticipate a decrease in hiring intent and 24 per cent do not anticipate any change, resulting in a seasonally adjusted Net Employment Outlook of 51 per cent. ""Despite rising inflation and the geopolitical instability, there is a positive sentiment across sectors in India in a bid to speed up the recovery process and sustain the economic growth of the country,"" said Sandeep Gulati, Managing Director, ManpowerGroup India. When compared to the same period last year, hiring sentiments have improved by a whopping 46 percentage points, while there is a 13 percentage points growth when compared to April-June period, the survey of more than 3,000 employers in India indicated. The survey further noted that employers anticipate strong demand for talent across key sectors, and digital roles continue to drive most demand. IT & Technology reported the strongest outlook (68 per cent), followed by Banking, Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (60 per cent), Other Services (52 per cent), Restaurants and Hotels (48 per cent) and Manufacturing (48 per cent). ""Growing need for digitization, automation and tech enabled services in our country coupled with demand for Indian IT workforce across the globe will retain the IT and Technology sector on top of the charts in the Indian job market,"" Gulati said. In the Asia Pacific region, the strongest hiring intentions were reported in India (51 per cent), Singapore (40 per cent) and Australia (38 per cent). While, the weakest hiring intentions were reported in Taiwan (3 per cent), Japan (4 per cent), and Hong Kong (11 per cent). Meanwhile, hiring prospects for all four regions of the country have strengthened when compared with the previous quarter and same time last year. The hiring pace is similar in 3 out of 4 regions (North, West and South) where the Net Employment Outlook stands at 53 per cent. For the East the outlook stood at 41 per cent, the survey noted. According to the survey, hiring optimism is being tempered by the highest levels of global talent shortages in 16 years. ""Shifting demographics, including shrinking birth rates and the rise in early retirees, means talent is scarcer than ever before,"" it said. Employers report difficulty filling open roles, with the biggest impacts being felt in Taiwan, Portugal, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, and India. On the talent shortage and difficulties being faced in finding the required soft skills to match the job, Gulati said, ""We are faced with an unprecedented demand supply gap as indicated by our Talent Shortage Survey. Reskilling and upskilling the workforce to mitigate this gap should be the highest priority for employers as well as industry players like us."""

16,"Adani Group, TotalEnergies form green hydrogen JV to invest $50 billion over the next 10 years",companies," Adani Group has entered into a partnership with TotalEnergies of France to jointly develop the green hydrogen ecosystem with an investment of $50 billion over the next 10 years, the two companies said in a joint statement. The joint venture, namely Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), will have TotalEnergies as a minority stakeholder with 25% interest. ANIL will develop a green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group, said that the partnership is a part of the group’s ambition to be the “largest green hydrogen player in the world.” “The partnership with TotalEnergies adds several dimensions that include R&D, market reach and an understanding of the end consumer. This fundamentally allows us to shape market demand. This is why I find the continued extension of our partnership to hold such great value,” Adani said. “Our confidence in our ability to produce the world’s least expensive electron is what will drive our ability to produce the world’s least expensive green hydrogen. This partnership will open up a number of exciting downstream pathways,” he added. In February this year, the ministry of power notified the first part of the National Hydrogen Mission policy on green hydrogen and green ammonia, aimed at boosting production. Green hydrogen could potentially be the enabler for the global transition towards sustainable energy with net-zero emissions economies. While the second part of the policy is still under consideration by the central government, several private sector companies and even state run companies have already made commitments towards working on green hydrogen production. ANIL will invest over $50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen and associated ecosystem. In the initial phase, the joint venture will develop green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030. For a country that relies on coal for more than 70 percent of its electricity, Adani's efforts are important in India's shift away from coal power. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, said that the partnership was a major milestone for the company in implementing its renewable and low carbon hydrogen strategy which aims to not only decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries by 2030, but also wants to pioneer the mass production of green hydrogen to meet demand as the market is likely to take off by the end of this decade. “This future production capacity of 1 million ton per annum of green hydrogen will be a major step in increasing TotalEnergies’ share of new decarbonized molecules including biofuels, biogas, hydrogen, and e-fuels to 25% of its energy production and sales by 2050,” said Pouyanné. The Adani Group and TotalEnergies are already partners for gas business, Adani Total Gas. The new partnership follows Adani group signing a non-binding pact with Nasdaq-listed Ballard Power Systems to evaluate a joint venture for investment in commercial production of hydrogen fuel cells for various mobility and industrial applications in India in February. The two companies hope to build on the synergies between the two platforms. Adani will offer knowledge of the Indian market, rapid execution capabilities, experience of operations and capital management. TotalEnergies will bring to the table its deep understanding of the global and European market, credit enhancement and financial strength to lower the financing costs, and expertise in underlying technologies. ANIL aims to be the largest fully integrated green hydrogen player in the world, with presence across the entire value chain, from the manufacturing of renewables and green hydrogen equipment (solar panels, wind turbines, electrolysers, etc.), to large scale generation of green hydrogen, to downstream facilities producing green hydrogen derivatives, the statement said. “The complementary strengths of the partners will help ANIL deliver the largest green hydrogen ecosystem in the world, which, in turn, will deliver the lowest cost of Green Hydrogen to the consumer and help accelerate the global energy transition,” the joint statement said. While others in the energy space are also gearing up for green hydrogen production, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries has ambitious plans for green hydrogen as a part of the conglomerate’s ambitious clean energy strategy. RIL also aims to be one of the largest producers of blue hydrogen globally by using petroleum coke. Also Read | As India awaits policy, these companies already have their green hydrogen plans in place RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani has announced a plan to invest Rs 75,000 crore over the next three years to build a new clean-energy business aimed at meeting the conglomerate’s commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2035. Ambani has said green hydrogen would be a priority, as the group aims to offer hydrogen energy at under $1 a kg in a decade. On Independence Day last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘National Hydrogen Mission’ from the Red Fort with the ambition to boost the growth of green hydrogen in the country to work towards being energy independent. As climate change and global warming concerns worsen and countries across the world commit to reducing emission, green hydrogen has generated a lot of interest given its ability to generate large scale energy with low carbon footprint. The recent advancements in technology have led to reduction in prices, which coupled with government incentives could make green hydrogen competitive as against conventional energy going ahead, experts believe."

He added that TV is likely to see mid to high single-digit ad growth and then there are concerns regarding TV subscription revenue which will keep average revenue per user (APRU) under check due to regulatory headwinds (NTO 2.0). When it comes to advertising expenditure, digital is growing faster than TV. TV is expected to grow by 7-8 percent while digital is estimated to grow by 25-20 percent, say experts. Prashant Puri, Co-Founder & CEO, AdLift also noted that the ad rates will increase by 25-30 percent from last year, till 2025. ""FMCG, consumer durables, electronics, and automobiles will continue to keep betting on IPL despite high premiums on digital."" If we go by analysts' estimates, ad rates on TV are likely to touch Rs 19.8 lakh for a 10-second ad slot and digital ad rates will be in the range of Rs 258.7-360 for a 10-second spot. Digital has seen a 70 percent premium over the floor price of Rs 12,210 crore. In the 2018-2022 media rights cycle, digital media rights value stood at Rs 4,040 crore, and TV rights at Rs 11,410 crore. ""On TV and digital, we expect the break even to happen only in the third year. As far as profitability is concerned, TV gross profit margin will peak at 12 percent in the fifth year whereas digital gross margin will breach 35 percent in the fifth year,"" said Taurani. In 2022, it is estimated that 54.5 percent of IPL revenue came from TV advertising, 10.9 percent from TV subscriptions, 21.8 percent from over-the-top (OTT) subscriptions, and 12.7 percent from OTT advertising. This is expected to change to 50.8 percent from TV advertising, 9.6 percent from TV subscriptions, 24.3 percent from OTT subscriptions, and 15.3 percent from ads on OTT. The bidders in the media rights auction race reportedly were Viacom18, Disney Star, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) for broadcast rights, and Viacom18 which operates streaming platform Voot, Disney Star which has OTT platform Hotstar, Zee which operates Zee5 were the contenders.

20,"Govt mulls appeal against English court order in RIL-BGEPL, pursue execution of $3.85 billion award",companies," India is considering an appeal against the English court order that has given a $111 million- arbitration award in favour of Reliance Industries Ltd and Shell-owned BG Exploration & Production (BGEPL) in a dispute over recovery of cost in the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields, the government said in a statement on June 13. The government also said it will push for the execution of a larger award amounting to $3.85 billion and interest that was awarded by the arbitral tribunal under the final partial award in 2016 in favour of the government. “The Government of India has the right to seek leave of the English Commercial Court to challenge this judgment passed by it. Further, notwithstanding two partial awards of $111 million and $143 million in the favour of the contractor, the larger award amounting to $3.85 billion plus interest by the arbitral tribunal under final partial award 2016 is in favour of the Government, and is now being pursued through the Execution Petition filed before the High Court of Delhi,” the government statement said. “It is pertinent to mention that, even in the latest award and order of the English Court dated 9.6.22 ($111 million), contractor’s claim amounting to $148 million has been rejected,” it added. On June 9, the government of India lost its appeal in The English Commercial Court which gave the $111 million arbitration award in favour of the two companies. In 2010, the then operators of Panna-Mukta-Tapti (PMT) fields – RIL and BGEPIL, moved court against the Indian government over cost recovery provisions, profit due to the government and payable statutory dues, including royalty, payable. The operators sought to raise the limit of cost that could be recovered from sale of oil and gas before they share the profits with the government. The government had executed two Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with ONGC Ltd, RIL and Enron, now BGEPIL (BG Exploration and Production India Limited) on December 22, 1994. Since the disputes arose between the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal has passed eight substantial partial awards. Sixty six of the 69 issues were decided in favour of the government of India in the final partial award passed by the Tribunal in 2016. Subsequently, the government of India issued a demand letter to the contractors, calling upon them to pay an amount of $3.85 billion (excluding interest). The contractor failed to make the payment as per the award and therefore, the government has filed an application for execution of final partial award 2016 before the Delhi High Court. But in 2016, RIL and BGEPIL challenged the final partial award of 2016 before the English Commercial Court. In April, 2018 the English Court passed a judgment in favor of the Union of India, dismissing eight out of nine challenges, and directed a ninth challenge to the tribunal for reconsideration. “The tribunal subsequently passed its order on this challenge, partly in favour of the Contractors. Out of the $402 million claims, the tribunal allowed a cost of $143 million and denied the contractors, a cost of $259 million,” the government statement said. Both the government and the contractors challenged the 2018 award before the English Commercial Court. The court disagreed with the tribunal’s denial of the cost of $259 million. In January 2021, the tribunal awarded a sum of $111 million in favour of the contractors. The government challenged this in the English Commercial Court which gave its judgment on June 9. The PMT fields, discovered by ONGC, were awarded for operations after bidding in 1994 to a consortium of ONGC (40 percent), RIL (30 percent) and Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd (30 percent). BGEPIL acquired Enron's 30 percent stake in the joint venture in February 2002, and later Shell acquired BGEPIL in 2015."

22,"NCLAT judgment in Amazon-Future case sends a strong message, say experts",companies," The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday, June 13, upheld the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) decision to keep in abeyance the regulatory approval for a 2019 investment deal between Amazon and a Future group firm—Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL)—and the decision is being hailed as a significant one for competition law and regulatory procedure in India. The CCI in December last year ruled that Amazon had not fully disclosed relevant information pertaining to its strategic interests in FCPL while seeking the body’s approval for the investment deal worth Rs 1,400 crore. Amazon was slapped with a fine of Rs 202 crore in total and was directed to apply afresh for CCI approval. The NCLAT, on Amazon’s appeal, agreed with the CCI’s finding and upheld its decision, though it reduced the fine to a total of Rs 201 crore. While the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), one of the intervening parties in the case, has welcomed the NCLAT ruling, Amazon has so far refused to offer a statement. “The order has proved the dictum ‘truth always prevail’ as right and gives a strong signal to one and all that India is not a banana republic and the laws are not weak,” CAIT national president B.C. Bhartia and secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said in a joint statement. Legal experts say the judgment sends out a strong message. Senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan, the lawyer representing FCPL in the case, said, “It’s an extremely significant judgment from NCLAT because it recognises the need for every entity to remain compliant with Indian laws.” One of the roles of the CCI is to prevent activities that may adversely affect fair competition. This forms the basis for entities seeking regulatory approval from this body that the proposed transaction is in line with the provisions of Indian competition law. This approval has to be obtained within the stipulated deadline laid down in the law. Srinivasan added that the NCLAT’s judgment also “recognises the scheme of legislation that requires full and complete disclosure of material details when an approval is sought to ensure that CCI has the ability to faithfully and properly discharge its statutory obligation in a time-bound manner”. The setback faced by Amazon is also likely to act as a cautionary tale for others who are likely to seek CCI approval in line with regulatory compliance. “With CCI getting a thumping from the appellate tribunal, the companies involved in M&A (merger and acquisition) activities will be on their toes when evaluating deals and the level of disclosures,” said Vaibhav Choukse, partner and head of practice (competition law) at JSA Advocates & Solicitors. Ritika Ganju, partner, Phoenix Legal, said that the CCI in its order of December 17, 2021, had reflected upon the significance of holistic reporting of the combination. “This includes not just commercial contracts directly dealing with the transaction but any contemplated strategic alliances and alignments between the acquirer and target groups which would impact CCI’s assessment of the transaction,” said Ganju. This view of the CCI endorsed by the NCLAT “will certainly make the applicant companies and their advisors cautious about the scope and ambit of disclosures”, she added. One thing that has been made clear in the NCLAT judgment is the scope of the CCI’s powers, experts said. Not only did the tribunal reject Amazon’s defence that it had made all the requisite disclosures but in doing so, it also rejected its argument that the CCI could not have kept the approval in abeyance. Also Read | NCLAT upholds CCI's order against Amazon: 5 highlights from the court order The NCLAT has laid down that the statutory authority under Competition Act, which is the CCI, has an “inbuilt, an implied residual power to annul, modify, vary or to keep the earlier order passed by it in abeyance / putting it on hold” in cases where the objective is to prevent any activity that may have an adverse effect on competition. “There is no express fetter in this regard, in the considered opinion of this ‘Tribunal’,” the NCLAT said in its written order. “It’s a big win for CCI… The tribunal has upheld the order of CCI in its entirety, thereby confirming CCI’s wide powers, which includes directions to refile the approval application and even suspend the approval under exceptional circumstances,” said Choukse."
