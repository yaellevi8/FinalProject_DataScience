4,"Taking Stock | Market erases gains to end flat amid volatility; auto shines, metal worst hit",markets," The Indian benchmark indices ended marginally lower in a highly volatile session on May 23, dragged by metal stocks as the government imposed export duties on iron ore and some steel intermediaries. At close, the Sensex was down 37.78 points or 0.07% at 54,288.61, and the Nifty was down 51.50 points or 0.32% at 16,214.70. During the day, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices touched 54,931.30 and 16,414.70, respectively. After a positive start with the Nifty opening above 16,300, the market remained in positive territory in the first half but erased all the gains in the second half to end on a flat note. ""Markets gave up all its gains in afternoon trade today as it simply could not recover after the export tax imposed on steel products with the metal index falling almost 9% to 5,200 levels in morning trade,"" said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities. ""The prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict coupled with its consequences and inflationary pressures weighed heavily in the minds of investors and traders."" ""Prospects of additional market borrowings by the GOI in the wake of the tax cuts on fuel to tame inflation also came to the forefront,"" he added. M&M, Maruti Suzuki, HUL, Asian Paints, and Larsen and Toubro were among the top Nifty gainers, while losers included JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Divi's Labs, ONGC, and Hindalco Industries. Among sectors, Nifty Auto and Information Technology indices rose 1 percent each, while the metal index fell 8 percent and the pharma index fell 1 percent.

Metal stocks bore the brunt while automobile, realty, and oil & gas stocks also came under selling pressure, thus dragging key indices lower. Technically, on intraday charts, the Nifty has formed a double top formation and on daily charts, it has formed a Hammer candlestick formation which is broadly negative. For day traders, 16,200 would act as a crucial support level, and below the same, we could see a quick intraday correction till 16,100-16,050. On the flip side, the fresh uptrend is possible only after a 16,300 intraday breakout. On breaching the level, the index could move up to 16,400-16,475. Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a positive note & attempted to scale higher on May 23. It went on to test the crucial level of 16,400 where the index had faced resistance in the last two weeks. 16,400 proved to be a strong barrier yet another time. The hourly chart shows that the upper end of an upward sloping channel also created pressure near 16,400. Thus, the index nosedived towards the end of the session & closed in the red for the day. The overall structure shows that the Nifty is likely to witness sideways action in the short term. 16,000 – 16,400 is expected to be the range for the next few sessions.

5,Rupee recovers from record lows to end 15 paise higher at 77.55/USD,markets," Rupee recovered from record lows and settled 15 paise higher at 77.55 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weak greenback overseas. At the interbank forex market, the domestic unit opened at 77.69 against the US dollar. It moved in a range of 77.51 to 77.69 during the session. The rupee finally snapped its three-session losing streak and closed at 77.55, registering a rise of 15 paise over its previous close. On Friday, the rupee had settled at a record low of 77.70 against the American currency. According Gaurang Somaiya, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, rupee continued to consolidate and volatility remained confined to a narrow range despite choppiness in domestic equities. ""Today volatility for the dollar could remain low as no major economic data is expected to be released from the US. We expect the USD-INR (Spot) to trade sideways and quote in the range of 77.20 and 77.80,” Somaiya added. However, unabated foreign fund outflows and firm crude oil prices weighed on the rupee and kept the appreciation bias capped. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 1 per cent lower at 102.12. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 37.78 points or 0.07 per cent lower at 54,288.61, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 51.45 points or 0.32 per cent to 16,214.70.

6,Government clips steel sector’s wings at wrong moment,markets," The steel sector, which looked all set to be the leader of the much-awaited revival in India’s private investment cycle, has now been left to hold the bag for dousing the flames of inflation in the country. On May 21, the government announced a series of measures to bring down inflation in the country which in April reached multi-month highs and forced the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee into an emergency hike in interest rate of 40 basis points earlier this month. Among the measures announced by the government, the one that could end up having long-term ramifications for India to emerge out of its decade-old slump in private capital expenditure is the move to bring in 15 percent duty on steel exports to reign in domestic prices. Analysts believe the export duty will not only hurt steel companies in terms of profitability as the lucrative export market, which drove earnings at a time when domestic demand was hit by COVID-19, becomes unattractive, but will cloud their long-term expansion plans. India’s finished steel exports rose by 25 percent in 2021-22 to 13.5 million tonnes while the same rose more than 60 percent when compared to the pre-pandemic period, according steel ministry data. Ironically, in March, the Steel Minister Piyush Goyal hailed India’s emergence as a key player in the global steel market as a vindication of the government’s export-focused policies in the pandemic era. The same export-focused policy, which was buttressed by steel import duties to deter countries like China and South Korea from dumping cheaper steel, now appear to have been kept on the backburner to reduce input costs for several steel-consuming industries. “Will it lead to lower price of housing, automobiles, construction? We don’t think so,” said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which has put its coverage on the sector under review in light of the shift in policy. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has termed the government’s measure a “policy shock” that “would slow down growth capex and could eventually force a reversal of duties”. Investors saw the sudden shift of policy in the same vein as shares of Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, JSW Steel, and SAIL tanked 6-16 percent on May 23. Motilal Oswal Financial believes that the measures are a year too late given that at the time profits of steel companies were near record highs and cost of coal was about 20 percent lower, allowing companies to easily absorb the higher cost of export. “The current measure will impact the ability and will of the companies to continue with their long term capex plans and will only commission the capacities where capex has been significantly committed,” Motilal Oswal Financial said in a note. Kotak Equities is of the view that the slowdown in capital expenditure from the sector, generally a key driver of private capex, could force the government to reverse the hike in export duties but “we do no build it in our base case”. Tata Steel, which announced a more than Rs 10,000 crore outlay on capital expenditure for 2022-23, said earlier this month that it will review its capex plan during the middle of the financial year with the expectation of increasing it substantially to bake in its long-term capacity expansion plans. Those plans will likely be put on hold given that much of it was driven by the need to cater to the appetite of global markets, which are dealing with China’s withdrawal as the dragon focuses on cleaning its environment. Jindal Steel and Power’s Managing Director VR Sharma summed up the shock for the industry when he told Reuters that the sector will be forced to cancel orders from European companies, who were counting on India to lend a hand in replacing million tonnes of Russian steel that are now under sanctions. ""This could possibly lead to force majeures. And the customer has done no wrong here and he doesn't deserve to be treated that way,” Sharma told Reuters.

7,Startup claims 'go-between' firm for IPO siphoned off funds,markets," In a stunning, if not, bizarre case of lack of financial know-how and market fraud, BSE-listed startup Trekkingtoes.com has alleged that a firm, acting as a go-between itself and its investment banker during its initial public offering (IPO) has run away with a large chunk of the proceeds of the issue. In an April 13 exchange filing, Trekkingtoes.com told BSE that the major portion of proceeds raised through an IPO by the company had been misappropriated by GYR Capital Advisors (formerly Alpha Numero Services). As per Trekkingtoes.com's complaint to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), GYR Capital Advisors was a consultant and intermediate between Fast Track Finsec and the company. The Jaipur-based company had raised Rs 4.54 crore through a public issue in August 2020. The company is a new-age digital startup involved in intercity cab rental services. “The company has initiated action against them for defrauding the company with the intention of siphoning the proceeds of the IPO, as aptly mentioned in our complaint attached below,” Trekkingtoes.com said. Trekkingtoes has filed a complaint with SEBI against Fast Track Finsec (merchant banker), whose former director Abhishek Vijay Kumar Sharma is a director at Alpha Numero (now known as GYR Capital), Rohit Pareek, and Mohit Baid, director of Alpha Numero, and three others. ""Without any ground or supporting documents they have taken our name in the public domain for which we will take necessary legal actions against in the due course,"" a spokesperson for GYR Capital Advisors said in an email statement. GYR Capital said that neither was it the investment banker nor an advisor to the issue. Promised land In 2020, Trekkingtoes.com’s founders Sahil Agarwal and Sagar Agarwal were approached by Fast Track Finsec, a SEBI-registered category-I merchant banker, with the idea for an IPO. Fast Track convinced the startup’s founders that it could help them raise funds from the market to grow the business instead of relying on the promoters’ own funds, debt and investments from friends and family, as was the case till then, the copy of the complaint filed by the company showed. “It is apposite to mention here that being a start-up and due to their lack of familiarity with the capital market, the Promoters were not well acquainted with and required hand-holding even for basic capital market processes, operations and understanding,” Trekkingtoes.com said in its SEBI complaint. As per the draft red herring prospectus of Trekkingtoes.com, Sagar Agarwal, a whole-time director and chief financial officer at the company, is Bachelor in Commerce (B.Com.) and has cleared Integrated Professional Competence Examination Certificate held by ICAI. Trekkingtoes.com ultimately floated a public offering with the intention of using the funds for strategic initiatives, repayment of some portion of existing debt and general corporate purposes. Red flags The promise of raising much-needed capital for the company and getting itself listed on the stock exchanges quickly turned into an ordeal for Trekkingtoes.com after it took a look at its agreement with the banker to the issue, ICICI Bank, just before the issue. “It was for the first time vide the banker to the issue agreement that the complainant got to know that it would be entitled to utilize only Rs 40-45 lakhs from proceeds of the IPO,” Trekingtoes.com said. According to Trekkingtoes.com, the investment bankers coerced the founders into agreeing to invest Rs 4 crore into other entities suggested by the investment bankers by way of strategic investment or unsecured loans. “The Respondent no. 3 (Abhishek Sharma) stated that if the complainant does not approve of the Respondent No. 1’s (Fast Track Finsec) new and arbitrary arrangement then the whole agreement between the Respondent No. 1 and the complainant would fall apart and the IPO would fail even before it had taken flight,” Trekkingtoes.com said. Trekkingtoes.com argued that since its founders had committed to repaying its debtors and told employees about the IPO, it was forced to agree to the unfavourable terms under “commercial duress”. According GYR Capital Advisors' statement to Moneycontrol, the purpose of the IPO funds was decided by the board of the company in a meeting as mentioned in the prospectus of the issue. ""Board of directors of trekkingtoes.com Ltd. are well qualified includes chartered accountant, IIT etc. and in the board meeting they have decided the fund utilization and identification of companies,"" GYR Capital Advisors said. Further, Fast Track Finsec allegedly assured the founders that it had conducted due diligence on the companies it wanted Treekingtoes.com to invest in and that the company “would be paid back the money invested in or lent to these companies with suitable interest and that the Trekkingtoes.com is completely secured as regards the entire arrangement”. Muddled Details Disaster struck Trekkingtoes.com in the days following the closure of the IPO on August 20, 2020. Having agreed to invest the majority of the proceeds in four firms shortlisted allegedly by the merchant banker, Trekkingtoes.com signed and emailed agreements with two of them, Swarnsiddhi and OPCL, for unsecured loan agreements. The startup also couriered the same documents to the addresses of the two companies but the delivery failed, raising suspicion that both entities were shell companies. Similarly, Trekkingtoes.com entered into an agreement to buy compulsorily convertible debentures of two others companies suggested by the merchant bankers but did not hear from both entities following the execution of the agreement. On August 28, the day of the market debut when issues arose around the listing of the company, Trekkingtoes.com tried to contact the merchant bankers but got no response. On speaking to ICICI Bank regarding the status of the IPO funds, “the complainant was shocked to learn from the Banker to the Issue that a sum of Rs 4 crore had already been siphoned off from their account”. Collateral damage This is not Fast Track Finsec’s first run-in with the regulator. In January, the merchant banker was penalised for failing to make timely disclosure of an open offer in the case of Sea Gold Infrastructure and AKM Lace and Embrotex—in both cases, it was the lead manager to the issue. But despite the case of alleged fraud with Trekkingtoes.com, Fast Track Finsec acted as the lead manager in another startup IPO listing, that of Jeena Sikho Lifecare, on the National Stock Exchange’s Emerge platform without any hitches. For investors in Trekkingtoes.com, meanwhile, things have been going from bad to worse. Investors faced a double whammy of having its funds allegedly siphoned off by the merchant bankers and also the stock has nosedived since its listing. Having raised funds at an issue price of Rs 105 per share, Trekkingtoes.com’s shares have sunk to Rs 29 each and have been suspended from trading due to penal reasons that spring from the IPO case. While the company has been submitting its quarterly results to the bourse, they are unaudited results that in many occasions were filed late and in some instances did not disclose the results. According to Trekkingtoes.com, the delay in disclosure of financial results is down to its inability to secure the services of a statutory auditor in the light of the diversion of its IPO proceeds.

History suggests an interesting answer: since the Second World War, Fed tightening has led to a range of outcomes for the economy, from hard to softish landings, but has always led to financial crises somewhere — including every major global crisis in recent decades.

While one lender’s performance need not stretch to the industry, there are enough signs that gold loans lost their sheen in FY22. What’s more, FY23 may turn out to be another challenging year for lenders.

12,"NSE shares see hectic trading, tax-evaders have a field day",markets," National Stock Exchange’s (NSE’s) shares are seeing heavy trading even as there is little clarity on when the bourse will be able to come out with its initial public offering (IPO). While foreign institutional investors have been sellers of late, local high networth individuals (HNIs) are on a buying spree with several new investors now picking up smaller lots. Unlike earlier, when the minimum lot size used to be 10,000 shares, now brokers are willing to engage in lot sizes of as small as 1,000 shares, or even 500 shares in some cases, accommodating investors willing to deploy smaller sums. This has resulted in a significant rise in the number of shareholders in NSE. This explains heavy trading in NSE shares, despite the absence of a formal platform, over the past year. In FY22, around 5 million NSE shares changed hands on an average every month, which works out to roughly 250,000 shares being transacted every trading day. That’s the kind of delivery-based volumes even many midcap stocks cannot stake claim to. Trading volume last month were down sharply to 2 million shares, but this has to be seen in the context of the broad-based sell off in the stock market. Price action in the stock, however, indicates that tax-evaders may be exploiting this liquid but unlisted stock. A hit with HNIs The number of HNIs owning NSE shares has risen exponentially over the last five years. At the end of FY21, just 7 individuals owned NSE shares. That figure now stands at 1838, with DMart founder Radhakishan Damani, industry captains, and many reputed stock market investors among the shareholders. The strong appetite for NSE shares is not surprising. NSE is India’s number one stock exchange with a 92.5 market share in the equity segment, a near monopoly in the equity derivatives segment, and the dominant player in the currency derivatives segment. Its operating profit margin is close to 70 percent and it is the number one derivatives platform globally according to data by the Futures Industry Association. Wide spreads And yet, for a stock so actively traded, the sharp variation in prices of individual deals is puzzling, even after accounting for the fact that there is no formal mechanism for price discovery. From the table below it can be seen the difference between the lowest price and the highest price in a month is 100 percent or even more than 200 percent at times.  Since the shares are unlisted, the disparity in prices on any given day will be more than what one would normally see in stocks traded on the stock exchanges. Besides the urgency of the counterparty and size of the block (of shares) are key factors deciding the price at which the deal is struck. And yet the difference should not be so wide, for two reasons. One, the NSE publishes details of every transaction, and two, HNIs are savvy enough to know what the prevailing market rates for NSE are. The discrepancy between the lowest and highest prices in a month was not as glaring between June 2020 and March 2021 when HNIs were just beginning to warm to NSE shares. Check table below.  So what explains the gap? Brokers dealing in NSE shares say the sharp discount to market price is usually when the one of the parties in the deal wants to avoid tax outgo or launder unaccounted cash. “In unlisted shares the rates are usually in a band of 5-7 percent or at most 10 percent depending on which side is pushing for the deal,” said a broker. “Anything more than that has nothing to do with fundamentals,” he said. On paper, the deal will be done at a hefty discount (or premium), and the difference settled in cash later. “It is hard to evade tax through deals in listed shares, but when the shares are unlisted, the tax man will have a hard time proving the trades were done way below the fair price,” the broker said. Fair value of NSE shares For financial year 2021-22, NSE’s consolidated revenues rose 53 percent to Rs 9500 crore and consolidated net profit rose around 44 percent to Rs 5184 crore. Earnings per share is Rs 105. Rival BSE, with a much smaller market share, slower growth in revenues, and less than half the operating profit margin, is quoting at roughly 40 times trailing earnings. Using the same yardstick, NSE shares should be valued north of Rs 4000 apiece, not factoring its dominant market position and better return ratios. The gap between the fair value and what it is going for at the moment can be explained by the uncertainty over when the bourse will eventually go public. At present, most deals in NSE shares are being done around Rs 2800 apiece, brokers said. They said that the process of NSE approving the transfer of ownership rights takes anywhere between 3-4 months. So most deals reported by the exchange in April would have been done in December 2021 or January 2022. NSE had filed the draft red herring prospectus for its IPO with SEBI way back in December 2016. However, the DRHP had to be withdrawn after the regulator began investigating a whistleblower complaint that certain trading members were getting preferential access to NSE’s data feed illegally under the colocation facility. Till January this year, many in the market were hopeful that NSE’s IPO would be approved by SEBI soon. But the wait may have got longer after SEBI’s final order on former NSE CEO Chitra Ramakrishna triggered a fresh probe by CBI into the colocation controversy. Ramakrishna and NSE’s ex-COO Anand Subramanian have been arrested and are presently behind bars.

15,Gold Prices Today: Yellow metal to edge higher amid weak dollar and high fuel prices; buy on dips,markets," Gold prices touched a more than one week high on Monday in international markets as an easing dollar continued to support greenback-priced bullion although higher US Treasury yields capped gains. Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,848.96 per ounce by 0201 GMT. At 9:35am, gold contracts were up 0.3 percent at Rs 50,984 for 10 gram on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) while silver added 0.49 percent at Rs 61,705 a kilogram. Gold prices traded higher on Monday with spot gold prices at Comex trading around half a percent up near $1854 per ounce. Gold prices continued upside on weaker dollar which fell below 103 on Monday. Economic growth worries and higher fuel prices may support yellow metal as inflation hedge, said Tapan Patel, Senior Analyst (Commodities), HDFC Securities. ""We expect gold prices to trade up with Comex spot gold support at $1820 and resistance at $1870 per ounce. MCX Gold June support lies at Rs 50600 and resistance at Rs 51200 per 10 gram,"" he said. Track Live Gold Prices Here Trading Strategy Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Gold prices snapped a four-week losing trend, managing to close on a higher note. Last week gold prices gained around two percent while silver prices recovered around six percent from their lows amid a fall in the dollar index and US bond yields. Last week, the dollar index witnessed a steep fall after failing to sustain around the fresh 19 year high at 105. The index eased more than two percent from recent highs and US 10-year bond yields also cooled off and slipped below 2.80 percent. Bullion prices also got support from weak US data. Unemployment claims rose again and existing home sales and the Philly Fed manufacturing index disappointed. This week investors’ focus will remain on the release of the Fed Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, which is due on Friday. Gold has support at $1832-1820 while resistance is at $1858-1870. Silver has support at $21.48-21.20 while resistance is at $22.10-22.38. In rupee terms gold has support at Rs 50,640–50,410 while resistance is at Rs51,140–51,350. Silver has support at Rs 61,010-60,750 while resistance is at Rs 62,350-62,610. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Swastika Investmart Due to continued selling pressure in global stock markets, investors have turned towards precious metals. Gold and silver have registered an increase after a month of continuous decline. The dollar has retreated from two-decade highs and rising concerns over US economic growth have turned investors to safe-haven assets. However, the US Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes and balance sheet cuts will still offer major resistance to gold's bullishness. The cut in the five-year loan prime rate by the People's Bank of China has supported the prices of industrial metals and crude oil, which has also boosted the prices of the precious metals last week. On MCX, a pullback can be seen so buying can be initiated at lower levels where gold has resistance at Rs 51100 and support at Rs 50500. Silver has resistance at Rs 62300 and support at Rs 60500. Amit Khare, AVP- Research Commodities, Ganganagar Commodity Gold and silver prices showed mixed movement on May 20 on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX); June gold contracts closed up by 0.56 percent at Rs 50,829 for 10 grams. July contract Silver futures closed at Rs 61,407 a kilogram, down 0.26 percent. As per technical chart, gold and silver are making bottom and we can see a huge short covering rally in the coming future; momentum indicator RSI is also indicating the same on the hourly as well as daily chart. Traders are advised to create fresh buy positions near given support levels and should focus on important technical levels. June Gold closing price Rs 50829, Support 1 - Rs 50700, Support 2 - Rs 50500, Resistance 1 - Rs 51000, Resistance 2 - Rs 51250.

18,"Daily Voice | Market far from being in a stable territory, pick these 4 themes, says Varun Lohchab of HDFC Securities",markets," Commodity prices are yet to stabilize and their future course of movements will dictate future actions of global central banks, hence, we believe market is far from being in a stable territory, Varun Lohchab, Head of Institutional Research at HDFC Securities said in an interview to Moneycontrol. The recent market correction has certainly provided some pockets of interesting investment opportunities, he said, adding HDFC Securities is bullish on the auto sector, which has underperformed for the past few years. The market veteran's advice of the participants is to choose bottom-up stock analysis to pick the fundamentally strong companies. Read the edited excerpts here: Do you think the bear market phase is over? We don't believe that bear market phase is over as the near-term risks might be known but their quantum and duration of existence are still unknown. While we're already in an inflationary environment, it is still to be seen how long does it last for. Prices of key commodities like crude, steel, coal, natural gas and palm oil have shown early signs of stabilizing after a steep rise but are yet to meaningfully decline. Also read - Real estate sector welcomes govt announcement to cut duties on iron, steel inputs Hence, pressure on CPI (consumer price index) and WPI (wholesale price index) continues which is adversely impacting consumption expenditure, household savings and corporate profitability. Also, while market has discounted certain expected interest rate hikes by US FED and RBI, any surprise with respect to quantum or pace of these rate hikes will trigger market jitters. Steeper-than-expected FED rate hikes could increase the quantum of FII outflows impacting market sentiments. As, trajectories of commodity prices are yet to stabilize and their future course of movements will dictate future actions of central banks, we believe market is far from being in a stable territory. Is the expected earnings downgrade in the coming couple of quarters already priced in by the market? As recent leg of commodity inflation became more prominent post outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war in the latter half of February 2022 and intensified subsequently, Q4FY22 earnings results didn't reflect its full impact. We expect the true intensity of inflation impacting earnings of companies in Q1FY23. Aggravating inflation will drive future rate hike decisions of RBI. While direct impact of inflation on commodity consuming companies is discounted, its indirect impact on household consumption sectors led by reduced monthly savings is yet to be priced. Also read - IT, pharma, FMCG, telecom likely to attract institutional flows in near term post recent correction It is expected to hit discretionary spending viz. retail, outdoor dining and travel. Further increased savings rates will trigger some outflows from equities to less risky assets like bank deposits. Do you think the valuations are looking more attractive now? What are the themes to pick now, especially after the recent correction? The recent market correction has certainly provided some pockets of interesting investment opportunities. We are bullish on the auto sector which has underperformed for the past few years due to various structural reasons. We believe that the worst is behind us and the sector will recover hereafter. Over the medium term, we expect elevated metal prices to soften, supply chain disruptions to improve gradually and a pickup in demand to play out. We also have a positive outlook on select large banks with healthy CASA ratios that will be beneficiaries in a rising interest rate scenario. Lastly, we are also bullish on Indian chemical industry which is witnessing historically high levels of CAPEX on the back of global supply chain diversification. The country is becoming a preferred manufacturing destination for international pharmaceutical & agrochemical clients as domestic companies are rapidly improving upon their technical capabilities. It is imperative to note that while these sectoral trends are expected to play out, investors must do bottom-up stock analysis to pick the fundamentally strongest companies in each industry. Also read - Infosys reappoints turnaround artist Salil Parekh as boss, showers stock options on top execs Is it the time to focus on defensive stocks considering the macro environment? While the macro environment is temporarily subdued, it is expected to bounce back strongly after a pause of few quarters driven by inherent long term tailwinds of Indian economy. Hence, we believe it is opportune time to look beyond current market weakness and invest in high conviction long term ideas rather than focusing on defensive stocks. The recent market sell off has made some fundamentally strong companies available at attractive valuations. Long-term investors with a 3 to 5 years investment horizon can use this opportunity to consolidate positions in their respective high conviction stocks. Such investors should realign the portfolio by trimming high valuation, low growth tail end stocks and replace those by stocks with long term earning growth visibility & moderate valuations. Should one start accumulating banking & financial space given the bond yields are rising? Also read - Consider buying LIC only if the insurer's metrics improve, says Anil Rego of Right Horizons While rising interest environment helps expansion of net interest margin for banks with healthy CASA, higher bond yields will hurt their treasury portfolios by way of increased mark to market losses. Also, while moderate rise in interest rates help banks as they increase their lending rates, a very steep rate hike can impede credit growth. As, we believe interest rate hikes in India will not be very steep, so select banks are expected to get benefitted. This would be a prudent choice to invest in select large banks with stable CASA franchise. Pertaining to other financial services companies, we are bullish on the long term potential of the insurance and capital market sectors in India. The monthly SIP flows have been strong (grew from Rs 4,335 crore in March 2017 to Rs 12,328 crore in March 2022) and country's demat accounts witnessed a sharp surge (from 4 crore in FY20 to 9 crore in FY22). Also, while the insurance penetration (total gross premium/GDP) in India is growing steadily it is only around 2 percent currently compared to 20-25 percent in developed nations. These are proofs of the financialisation of savings story beginning to play out. Also, there is a long and profitable runway ahead for broking and asset management companies. With so much headway for growth, we are positive on the industry's long-term outlook. One needs to ensure to be stock specific in these industries while making investment decisions. Do you expect three more rate hikes of 50 bps each by Federal Reserve? Do you think the same has already been priced in by the market? US FED chairman has been unequivocal about doing ""whatever it takes"" to control inflation which is at an unprecedented levels in USA. As increasing costs of essential goods and services are outstripping wage gains, FED is expected to keep raising rates till inflation falls in a clear and convincing way. It is widely expected that rates need to be elevated to more than 3 percent from current level of around 1 percent in order to curb inflation meaningfully. In the wake of this situation, another three 50 bps hikes won't be surprising. While direct impacts of interest rate hikes might be already discounted by the market, its secondary impacts are yet to be fully priced in. As US households are relatively highly leveraged, so steep rise in rates will increase monthly mortgage and credit card payments leaving less room for consumption expenditure. Further, savings rate will become more lucrative than earlier. A combination of incentive for savings and an impediment to borrowings will lead to a decline in consumption expenditure. This will adversely impact all rate sensitive consumption sectors namely housing, auto and retail. Currently we are dealing with a multitude of volatile economic variables such as global inflation, high commodity prices, geopolitical tension, supply chain disruptions, etc. Any adverse incremental news flow on any of these could decisively drive central bank future moves and hence can impact an already jittery market. Will the RBI take repo rate above 5 percent considering the increased focus on inflation concerns and elevated oil prices? We expect the RBI to hike rates 3-4 times more this year and expect the terminal repo rate in this cycle at 5.6 percent. The RBI governor has already explicitly stated that the central bank will prioritize reigning in inflation over growth. What makes this inflationary environment particularly difficult is that it is led by global supply chain disruptions. India is particularly impacted because of our import dependence on key commodities such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas. While the repo rate hikes will certainly help in curbing inflation to some extent, global commodity prices will need to soften for inflation to truly ease. It is however imperative to note that the interest rate hikes expected in India will not be as steep as those expected in USA. Hence the impact felt by Indian corporates and households will be less acute compared to their American counterparts.

19,Oil climbs in tight market as US driving season looms,markets," Oil prices rose in early trade on Monday with U.S. fuel demand, tight supply and a slightly weaker U.S. dollar supporting the market, as Shanghai prepares to reopen after a two-month lockdown fuelled worries about a sharp slowdown in growth. Brent crude futures rose 82 cents to $113.37 a barrel at 0126 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed 69 cents, or 0.6%, to $110.97 a barrel, adding to last week's small gains for both contracts. ""Oil prices are supported as gasoline markets remain tight amid solid demand heading into the peak U.S. driving season,"" said SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes. ""Refineries are typically in ramp-up mode to feed U.S. drivers' unquenching thirst at the pump."" The U.S. peak driving season traditionally begins on Memorial Day weekend at the end of May and ends on Labour Day in September. Analysts said despite fears about soaring fuel prices potentially denting demand, mobility data from TomTom and Google had climbed in recent weeks, showing more people were on the roads in places like the United States. ""High frequency data suggests demand continues to grow,"" ANZ analysts said in a note. A weaker U.S. dollar also sent oil higher on Monday, as that makes crude cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. Market gains have been capped, however, by concerns about China's efforts to crush COVID with lockdowns, even with Shanghai due to reopen on June 1. Lockdowns in China, the world's top oil importer, have hammered industrial output and construction, prompting moves to prop up the economy, including a bigger-than-expected mortgage rate cut last Friday.

21,"Stock selloff to intensify as fresh 10% plunge looms, survey finds",markets," Get ready for a fresh slump in the world’s most-watched stock index, as economic growth fears spiral and the Federal Reserve embarks on its biggest policy-tightening campaign in decades. With the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market last week and notching more than $1 trillion in losses, participants in the latest MLIV Pulse survey reckon there’s more pain to come. The gauge is likely to keep falling this year before bottoming at around 3,500, according to the median projection of 1,009 respondents. That represents a decline of at least 10% from the Friday close of 3,901 -- and a gut-wrenching 27% drop from the January peak.  The Fed’s hawkish-at-all-costs posture, the chaos in supply chains and intensifying threats to the business cycle are all undermining confidence in Corporate America’s profit machine, while equity valuations keep sinking. Money managers endured a worse drawdown in the Covid-spurred tumult of 2020, but that’s scant consolation with projected losses of this scale. “I still think the worst is not behind us,” said Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Corp., on Bloomberg Television Friday. “There’s a pervasive fog of negative sentiment out there.” Sobering profit assessments from the likes of retailer Target Corp. and network-equipment company Cisco Systems Inc. saw investors take the ax to share prices last week. Short interest in a popular exchange-traded equity fund jumped near levels last seen in March 2020. The renewed haven bid for US government bonds suggests money managers are getting increasingly fearful about the economic trajectory, with lockdowns in China and the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict taking their toll. As the retail-stock meltdown kicked off last week, respondents became more bearish over the latter part of the May 17-20 polling period. On average MLIV professionals in the research, risk management and sales community were more pessimistic than their peers in portfolio management and sell-side trading. (The mean data can be skewed by outlier views.) Meanwhile, Marko Kolanovic at JPMorgan Chase & Co. is downplaying fears of an oncoming US recession and the median estimate from prominent Wall Street strategists suggests the index will close the year out at 4,800, suggesting hopes for a market bounce later this year. For Kristina Hooper, while an economic downturn is “pretty much priced in,” she doesn’t see that happening. “Sentiment is very negative, which supports the view we’re closer to the bottom,” said the chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd. Yet as central bankers seek to engineer a tightening of financial conditions to moderate excesses, the risks of further cross-asset chaos is very real. Asked which event will take place before the Fed shifts to dovish policy, 47% of respondents said they anticipated the S&P 500 falling 30% from its peak, while a similar proportion said US unemployment would rise to 6%, from 3.6% currently. More than 40% expect investment-grade credit spreads to blow out beyond 250 basis points before the monetary-easing cycle kicks in, while around one-in-four see American home prices tumbling 20%. Asked which asset class would need to see further declines before the risk-aversion cycle blows over, readers overwhelmingly cited equities, while housing, commodities and bonds also received submissions. Meanwhile, some 31% of respondents said the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle would deliver the biggest boost to growth and 27% indicated a preference for a scenario whereby China ends its zero-Covid policy. Around one in five said that a bigger growth dividend would come if the war in Ukraine were to end, and a similar proportion voted for a drop in crude oil to $70 a barrel.

0,Top 10 trading ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks as market snaps five-week losing streak,markets," The market snapped a five-week losing streak and closed 3 percent higher in the week ended May 20. Volatility remained on the higher side amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis, and fear of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. After losing more than 11 percent in the previous five weeks, the Nifty50 closed decisively above 16,000 mark at 16,266, up nearly 500 points and formed a bullish candle on the weekly scale. The index also closed way above 5 and 10 days simple moving averages whose value placed above 16,060 levels. The index has not fallen below its March lows (15,671) and also held strongly above the 15,700 mark, which both could act as strong support levels in coming days and sustaining above 16,000 could take the index beyond 16,600 mark, experts said. ""With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart which has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said. On the flipside, he said, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600. ""And till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key."" Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. ""This we believe should do extremely well if market remains above the psychological support of 16,000,"" Sameet Chavan said. Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 20 closing prices: Expert: Vinay Rajani, CMT and Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Chalet Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 302.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 335 | Return: 11 percent  Elecon Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 204.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 227 | Return: 11 percent The stock has surpassed the previous top resistance of Rs 200 with rising volumes. Stock has broken out from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly charts. It has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily charts. Indicator and oscillator setup is bullish on short to medium term charts.  KSB: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,455.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,595 | Return: 10 percent The stock surged more than 8 percent with a jump in volumes on May 20, 2022. It has registered fresh all-time high of Rs 1,484. It has broken out from the “flag” pattern on the weekly charts. It is placed above all important moving averages, which indicates a bullish trend on all time-frames. Indicators and oscillators have been showing strength in the current uptrend.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities KEC International: Buy | LTP: Rs 379.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 345 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 16 percent The stock is turning positive on the daily chart. For the past two months, the major oscillator MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has been trending up, while the price is making lower lows, indicating a change in the prevailing trend in the near future. It had formed the lowest level at Rs 345 and bounced back sharply. We expect further upside in the near term. It is at Rs 380 and the strategy should be to buy at current levels and add more at Rs 355. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 345. At higher levels, the stock would face resistance at Rs 410 and Rs 440.  Nestle India: Buy | LTP: 16,862 | Stop-Loss: Rs 16,000 | Target: Rs 18,500 | Return: 10 percent The stock was in an extended corrective wave. In September 2021, it was at Rs 20,610 and, in the last week, it was at Rs 16,000. Technically, we think it has completed the correction at Rs 16,000 and has bounced back sharply along with sectoral movement. Until the stock breaks the Rs 16,000 level, it will continue to move higher. During the corrective pattern, the stock spent the maximum time at Rs 18,500, which should be its first price target. Our advice is to buy at the current levels and place a stop-loss at Rs 16,000.  Grasim Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,488.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,430 | Target: Rs 1,600 | Return: 7.5 percent The stock is forming a double-bottom formation at Rs 1,430. It is still in corrective mode, however, the Rs 1,400 level should act as a trend decider level for the stock. Unless the stock breaks the Rs 1,430 level, we can see the stock rallying towards Rs 1,575-1,600 level. Last year also the level of Rs 1,430 acted as the key support and helped the stock to take the level of Rs 1,600 at the minimum level and Rs 1,800 level at the maximum. It is advisable to buy between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,450 levels. However, stop-loss is mandatory at Rs 1,430 level.  Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking Inox Leisure: Buy | LTP: Rs 493 | Stop-Loss: Rs 465 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 10 percent Inox Leisure witnessed a marginal dip after making a new record high and retraced to the support zone of the neckline (breakout) area of the previous consolidation range. It has spent nearly two weeks around that zone while holding firmly above the support zone of medium term moving average (100 EMA) on the daily chart.  TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 684.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 640 | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 10 percent We see a decent traction in the auto space despite the prevailing corrective phase and TVS Motor is among the top performers. Broadly, it has been consolidating in a range and currently trading around the upper band of the same. The chart pattern indicates a strong possibility of a breakout so traders can consider initiating long positions within Rs 680-685 levels.  Deepak Nitrite Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,972 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,085 | Target: Rs 1830 | Return: 7 percent It has been trading in a declining channel for the last seven months and currently trading below the support zone of major moving averages. The recent upswing has resulted in the formation of a fresh shorting pivot which may result in a decline towards the lower band of the channel ahead. We thus recommend creating shorts on an uptick within Rs 1,980-2,000 zone.  Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com Britannia Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,450.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,340 | Target: Rs 3,640 | Return: 5.5 percent The FMCG space has recently bucked the trend and inspite of the broader market correction, certain stocks from this sector have managed to hold well. This stock was trading in a falling channel and after some consolidation; prices have given a breakout from the channel. The ‘RSI Smoothened’ oscillator, too, is indicating a positive momentum and thus, we expect an up move in prices in the near term. Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,450-3,430 for potential target of Rs 3,640 in next few weeks. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 3,340.  Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 130.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 122 | Target: Rs 144 | Return: 10.5 percent Recently, the stock has managed to show a relative outperformance during market correction and the prices have given a breakout from its resistance zone on Friday. The breakout was supported with high volumes which is a positive signs. Also, it has resumed the ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ structure which indicates that this stock could witness further buying interest in the near term. Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 130-127 for potential target of Rs 144 in next few weeks. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 122.

3,Gold hits over 1-week high as US dollar dips,markets," Gold prices touched a more than one-week high on Monday, as an easing dollar supported greenback-priced bullion, although rising U.S. Treasury yields capped gains.

The dollar began the week on the back foot, following its first weekly loss in nearly two months, as investors cut bets on more dollar gains from rising U.S. rates and hoped that easing lockdowns in China can aid global growth. USD/ A weaker dollar makes bullion more attractive for overseas buyers. However, benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields firmed, limiting demand for zero-yield gold. US/ St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard reiterated his view last week that the U.S. central bank ought to raise interest rates to 3.5% this year to get high inflation more quickly under control. (Full Story) Bullion, seen as a safe store of value during times of economic crises, tends to become less attractive to investors when U.S. interest rates are raised because it yields no interest. Asian stocks faced an uncertain start on Monday as persistent inflation fears and the prospect of rising interest rates dogged the global economic outlook.

11,Asia markets tussle with inflation and rates concerns,markets," Asian stocks faced an uncertain start on Monday as persistent inflation fears and the prospect of rising interest rates dogged the global economic outlook, which remains mired in negative sentiment. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.04% higher, after U.S. stocks ended the previous session with negligible gains for the day. The index is down 3.6% so far this month. In early trade, Australian shares gained 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei stock index was 0.85% higher. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.7883% from its U.S. close of 2.787% on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.5869%, up from 2.583%. Uncertainty in market sentiment this week follows the S&P 500's meagre gains on Friday of just 0.01%. The Nasdaq declined 0.30% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%. Despite the marginal gains, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded their seventh straight weeks of losses, the longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. Inflationary pressures remain top of mind for investors, given German wholesale inflation figures published on Friday showed a higher than expected jump indicating prices will remain elevated in the short term future. Germany's producer price index for April rose 2.8% for the month, which meant annual growth was a persistently high 33.5%. In Australia, the Labor Party ended a near 10 year rule of conservative government at a general election on the weekend While Labor has promised climate, housing and enhanced social welfare reforms analysts do not believe the change in government will crate major implications for the nation's economy.

""Put another way, our economic forecasts and call on the RBA are unchanged despite the change of national leadership."" In early Asian trade, the dollar rose 0.04% against the yen to 127.9.

The concerns over global economic growth has prompted renewed support for gold. ""Gold prices saw the first weekly gain since mid-April as safe haven demand was boosted by concerns over economic growth amid high inflation,"" ANZ analysts said in a research note on Monday.

12,"Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on Petronet LNG, Axis Bank for short term",markets," Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One We started the proceedings last Monday on a positive note despite sluggish global cues. In an initial hour, the gains extended to move towards 16,000 mark. Similar to recent trends, the profit-booking took place at higher levels to erase all gains around the midsession. Although the market recovered slightly thereafter, the overall movement was quite choppy to conclude the day around 15,850, with nearly four-tenths of a percent gains. This was followed by a massive relief move last Tuesday, which extended towards 16,400 on the subsequent day. However, the global weakness struck back once again on the weekly expiry session with a huge gap-down to retest 15,800. The market was not done with its twists as Friday's session opened with yet another gap; but this time it was fortunately on the higher side. This pleasant surprise picked up its momentum as the day progressed, to conclude the week convincingly above 16,200 mark. The second half of the week gone by was full of dramatic twists and turns. Both the counterparties were caught napping in all this but, as we mostly say ‘all's well that ends well’, eventually the bulls turned out to be victorious as they managed to pull the Nifty back inside the safe terrain by gaining over 3 percent from previous week's close. With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart who has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone. On the flipside, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600 and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key. Let's see how things pan out this week. It would be important to keep a regular tab on global developments and one should certainly be prepared for surprising moves on either side. As far as sectoral participation is concerned, we witnessed some decent relief moves in most of the beaten heavyweight spaces this week. Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs which, we believe, should do extremely well if the market remains above the psychological support of 16,000. Here are two buy calls for short term: Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 227.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 217.80 | Target: Rs 245 | Return: 7.5 percent If we take a glance at the price action for last ten odd months, we can clearly see rangebound movement with slightly negative bias. Stock prices continued with its lower lows lower highs configuration all this while and has faced tremendous resistance around the sturdy wall of '200-day SMA'. Of late, we witnessed lot of changes structurally as prices managed to turn the tide upwards by confirming 'Higher Highs Higher Lows' and importantly, has managed to finally traverse the '200-SMA' with some authority. There are no exceptional volumes as such, but are certainly much higher than its previous average daily volumes, which provides credence to the move. Hence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 245. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 217.80.  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 673.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 657 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 4 percent Overall financial space has been one of the worst performing spaces in last couple of months and 'Axis Bank' has certainly contributed in it to the fullest. After witnessing a 20 percent price correction from recent highs, the stock prices finally saw some respite around the multi-month supports of Rs 640 – 630. On last Friday, we could see first sign of strength after sustaining beyond the '5-day EMA' along with positive crossover in 'RSI-Smoothened' oscillator from its deeply oversold territory. Hence, if global market remains stable, this stock is likely to give decent relief rally in the coming week. We recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 700.

13,"IT, pharma, FMCG, telecom likely to attract institutional flows in near term post recent correction",markets," Mitesh Dalal, Director and Chief Investment Strategist at Standard Chartered Securities (India) May 2022 has been a highly volatile month for equities, with Nifty50 nearing to lows seen in July 2021. Unscheduled surprised rate hike by Reserve Bank of India and sharp rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve has led to muted sentiments across the global equities. High inflation continues to be the key concern around the globe for central banks, mainly fuelled by geo-political issues causing disruption in supply chain around the globe. Markets eventually are likely to adjust themselves with increasing interest rate scenarios, while focus on earnings can provide healthy portfolio returns going ahead to investors. We expect the volatility, which is at its peak currently, to subside in the coming months as the ongoing earnings season brings better clarity on the demand, arrival of monsoon on southern cost of India and a possible resolution to the geo-political issues. The key concern around inflation across the world is likely to normalise post resolution of the geo-political issues. The current equity valuations (12-month Forward Nifty50 PE ratio is currently nearing its long-term average) provides further comfort as consensus has started factoring c.75-100bps of rate hike by RBI in next 9-12 months along with c.150bps of rate hike getting priced by US FED. Q4 FY22 earnings season has not seen any significant downgrades in earnings estimates. Companies with sustainable growth at reasonable valuations are likely to defend the valuation de-rating across the markets in the current rising interest rate scenario. Management commentaries across the sectors seems to be bullish around demand scenario while margin pressures persist. The much-required correction/volatility in markets has provided investors an opportunity to add exposure to equities for the long term in a systematic manner. While it's difficult to guess the bottom, adding exposure in current dips is likely to provide healthy returns over the longer term. Technically, Nifty has support c. 15,500 (c.500points downside) while we do expect Nifty returns to be even year-on-year (c.17600 CY22). Our positive bias remains towards large private sector banks (valuations are favourable versus growth opportunities). Defensives like IT, Pharma, FMCG and Telecom are likely to attract institutional flows in the near term post the recent correction. Export opportunities in agrochemical companies, industrial components are likely to find sustained earnings growth over the long-to-medium term. Based on technical chart readings, FMCG / consumer stocks are likely to find short term bounce from their distress levels. Key risks: Crude oil sustaining above the $100 a barrel mark could present a challenge for tackling inflation and act as a risk for fiscal math. Interest rate hikes to compress valuation multiples as cost of equity and cost of debt increase.

14,Markets may face volatility amid derivatives expiry; global trends and FII trading key: Experts,markets," Global factors and trading activity of foreign institutional investors are expected to guide domestic market sentiments this week, while equity benchmarks may face volatility amid monthly derivatives expiry, analysts said. Indian markets have been witnessing volatile trades for the past several trading sessions. However, the Nifty managed to break its five-week losing streak and ended with a decent weekly gain of 3 per cent, said Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Inflation and slowdown in the global economy means stagflation is a key concern for the global equity markets, ""therefore, we are seeing relentless selling by FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors). However, Indian markets are in a better position due to support from domestic investors,"" he added. ""The market may remain volatile this week due to May month expiry. On the global front, minutes of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting will be released on 25th May, which will be an important trigger, while movement of the dollar index and commodity prices will be other important factors,"" Meena said. Yesha Shah, head of equity research, Samco Securities, said, ""The volatility observed last week is expected to continue considering major economic data releases, the current earnings season and the monthly expiry. The FOMC minutes, US GDP growth rate forecasts and initial jobless claims will all influence global market sentiment."" Last week, the Sensex climbed 1,532.77 points or 2.90 percent, while the Nifty jumped 484 points or 3.06 percent. Last week, the Sensex climbed 1,532.77 points or 2.90 percent, while the Nifty jumped 484 points or 3.06 percent. ""Overall we expect this volatility to continue this week as well with several macro headwinds like high inflation and aggressive interest rate hike. Also heavy FII selling continued, which added to the overall pressure in the market,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, head — retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. From the earnings front, SAIL, Zomato, Adani Ports, Deepak Fertilizers, InterGlobe Aviation, Hindalco, NMDC, GAIL and Godrej Industries would announce their quarterly numbers this week.

15,"Daily Voice | Consider buying LIC only if the insurer's metrics improve, says Anil Rego of Right Horizons",markets," ""In the IT space, largecaps have corrected close to 20 percent and the midcaps close to 30 percent due to margin contractions in the last few quarters on high attrition, but demand continues to be robust while some slowdown is expected in the medium term,"" Anil Rego, founder and fund manager of Right Horizons PMS said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Right Horizons is bullish about quality names on a longer-term horizon beyond four to five years as they are available at attractive valuations. On Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) which saw a tepid listing, he said: ""Sales of newer policies are lower, pay-outs are increasing, less people are paying premiums for the policies purchased and metrics like VNB (value of new business) margin are one-third of the industry."" Hence, Rego said it is better to avoid LIC unless VNB margins and other metrics improve. Do you think the market has discounted all negatives? Markets are sort of leading indicators, pricing in information. While we are in times of uncertainty it is the unexpected that has led to sharp downmoves recently and expected factors have been priced in making the markets reasonably valued; historically when Nifty PE trades below 20 we have seen decent returns in the following years. It is difficult to predict the short term so any sharp upmoves depend on the type of information that may come in but the fact of the matter is commodity cost pressure is impacting interest rates and profitability of companies although the cause for concern is the same across the globe and as such is priced in. But what is different for India is we are in a position that is fundamentally sound compared to peers because of deglobalisation after the pandemic and the underlying policies that have been and are tailwinds for growth. We recommend not to rush into deploying cash all at once because markets may become even more attractive, but experience has taught us never to time the market. So one can look to exploit opportunities with a gradual approach over the next few months. Are you bullish on telecom, which is largely a two player market now? In a recent interview, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal mentioned that the firm is likely to push through a tariff hike in 2022, with expectations of increasing ARPU (average revenue per user) to Rs 200; the subscriber addition may remain muted depending on whether the market is ready to absorb this hike, but revenues may increase sequentially. In a price-sensitive sector, one needs to track the players very closely and see how subscriber additions and absorption of such hikes play out to take a long-term call. If Jio were to go public the telecom sector may be in for a re-rating. Is it the right time to bet on IT services? In the IT space, largecaps have corrected close to 20 percent and midcaps close to 30 percent due to margin contractions in the last few quarters on high attrition but demand continues to be robust while some slowdown is expected in the medium term. We are bullish about quality names on a longer-term horizon beyond four to five years as they are available at attractive valuations. Should one start taking exposure to auto space or wait for the situation to improve? It is the supply side issues that are the headwinds, demand is not an issue any more; it was the inability to service the demand that has been a major issue. However, with the expectation of improvement in the supply chain, steel prices cooling down and debottlenecking being exercised, companies have announced higher capex plans for FY23. Tata Motors for example has raised capex by 30 percent to Rs 32,000 crore in FY23 hoping to extend a strong recovery and is sitting on a record booking of over 2.5 lakh units or Rs 1.1 lakh crore of business, which needs to be delivered in six to nine months. Jaguar Land Rover is sitting on its highest ever booking of 1.68 lakh units whereas the passenger vehicle business is a little over 75,000 units to 1 lakh. Considering the demand outlook, product launches, and attractive valuations, we are positive on Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland in the commercial vehicle space, and among ancillaries we prefer Sona BLW Precision Forgings. What is your take on LIC that has seen a tepid listing? When it comes to LIC it is not necessarily the pricing or the industry that is the issue; sales of newer policies are lower, pay-outs are increasing, less people are paying premiums for the policies purchased and metrics like VNB (value of new business) margin are one-third of the industry. As things stand now it is better to avoid LIC; one may consider taking a stance if there's an improvement in VNB margins and other metrics. BSE IPO index fell more than 30 percent in the last six months. What are your thoughts on the Indian IPO market that has seen several listings since last year, but around 40 percent of them are way below their issue prices including new age companies?. The number of listings will always be the highest in the years when markets are in a bull run due to the euphoria as investors look forward to listing gains without considering the underlying businesses. India witnessed a high number of listings from various new-age technology-driven and emerging sectors in 2021. However, as the market enters a sense of fear, stocks with no clear view of profitability will be discarded and discounted and that is what was witnessed in the last few months. What are your thoughts on eMudhra and Aether Industries IPOs? Do you expect muted listing for Delhivery and Venus Pipes? We have always been of the view to pick companies with strong fundamentals because such firms are resilient and thrive; this has been proven more so in the last two years than ever and as such we never look at investment for the sake of listing gains. Any business available at premiums should be avoided especially in the present market scenario.

I) Delhivery: Logistics and supply chain startup is going to list on May 24. The IPO ran from May 11-13 with a price band of Rs 462-487 per share. Delhivery planned to mobilise Rs 5,235 crore through its public issue that comprises a fresh issue of Rs 4,000 crore and an offer for sale of Rs 1,235 crore by shareholders.

Of the total issue size, 75 percent is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15 percent for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10 percent for retail investors.

FIIs offloaded equities worth of Rs 11,401.34 crore while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth of Rs 9,472.91 crore in the week. In the month of May till now FIIs have sold equities worth Rs 44,102.37 crore and DIIs have bought shares worth Rs 36,208.27 crore. 6) Corporate Action Here are key corporate actions taking place in the coming week:  7) Technical View On Friday, Nifty formed a bullish candle along with an island reversal pattern on a daily scale which has bullish implications after the tug of war between bulls and bears over the last seven trading sessions. Nifty formed a bullish candle on the weekly scale after the decline of last five weeks and now a negation in lower highs on the weekly scale could trigger short covering spike. ""Now it has to hold above 16161 zones to extend this bounce towards 16400 and 16666 zones while on the downside support exists at 16000 and 15800 zones,"" Chandan Taparia, vice president, analyst-derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. 8) F&O Cues Option data suggests a trading range between 15800 and 16500 zones. On the option front, maximum call OI (open interest) was at 17000 then 16300 strike while maximum put OI was at 16000 then 15800 strike. Call writing was seen at 16300 strike while meaningful put writing was seen at 16000 then 16100 strike. ""Volatility has fallen from higher zones from 24.55 to 23.10 levels, which supported for some smart pullback and now needs to come down for market stability,"" said Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities. ""Nifty witnessed a strong recovery as the benchmark index ended about three percent higher. On the daily chart, the index has formed a double bottom. Immediate resistance is visible at 16400 and a decisive breakout above 16400 may induce a rally towards 16600-16700. On the lower end, support is visible at 16000,"" De added. 9) Rupee After hitting a new low in the last week, dollar-rupee will remain in focus as the domestic currency inched towards 78 level and touched a fresh record low of 77.92 in the week ended May 20. The rupee has erased some of its intra-week losses despite the sell-off in equities. Further positive news from China should improve sentiments and trigger a re-test of 77.25 levels. A move above 77.80 though will open targets of 78.25 levels for the current leg of rupee depreciation, said Emkay Global Financial Services. 10) Russia-Ukraine war Global investors will keep an eye on the fresh development on the Russia-Ukraine war situation as Russia has suffered huge setbacks and heavy losses of men and equipment in the 86 day war. The Group of Seven leading economies agreed Friday to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid to Ukraine to ensure its finances do not hinder its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion. Italy's foreign minister said on Friday that the nation has submitted a peace plan for Ukraine to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said during a Council of Europe meeting in Turin, Italy, that the plan submitted on Thursday calls for local cease-fires to evacuate civilians along humanitarian corridors, and creating the conditions for a general cease-fire leading to a long-lasting peace, Reuters reported.

19,"Shree Cement Q4 Results | Standalone profit falls 16% YoY to Rs 645 crore; revenue grows 3.6% to Rs 4,099 crore",markets," Shree Cement Limited on May 21 reported a 16 percent decline in standalone net profit of Rs 645 crore in the fourth quarter of FY22, as against Rs 768 crore recorded a year ago. On a sequential basis, the profit increased by 31 percent from Rs 492 crore earned during the October–December period. Standalone revenues for the Rajasthan-based cement major rose 3.6 percent on-year to Rs 4,099 crore as compared to a revenue of Rs 3,958 crore registered in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, the revenue was 15.4 percent higher from Rs 3,552 crore recorded in the previous quarter, according to the exchange filing from Shree Cement. The year-on-year decline in profit was due to surge in power and fuel costs, along with the high base of last year’s quarter. Meanwhile, the sequential growth was aided by higher volumes and better realizations during the quarter. For the full-year period from April – March 2022, the standalone PAT witnessed a growth of 2.8 percent to Rs 2,377 crore from Rs 2,312 crore achieved during FY21. Standalone revenues for FY22 jumped 13 percent to Rs 14,306 crore from the revenues of Rs 12,669 crore for last year. The cost of raw materials as a percentage of revenues declined 70 bps on year to 6.6 percent. On a sequential basis, the saving was 140 bps. Employee costs as a percentage of revenue witnessed a steady decline both on year and quarter-on-quarter basis to 4.8 percent, compared to 6.2 percent during the same period last year and 5.5 percent during the previous quarter, said Shree Cement. The rise in energy prices have inflated the power bill for the company 10.1 percent on year and 3.4 percent on quarter. The power cost as a percentage of revenue came in at 26.2 percent during the quarter. The impact of rise in crude oil prices was visible in the rising freight and forwarding charges compared to previous quarter to 23 percent, a sequential increase of 1.5 percent. On a yearly basis, however, the freight cost declined by 1.1 percent. On February 1, the company started commercial operations of its clinker grinding unit at Patas in Pune District having a capacity of 3.0 MTPA (million tonnes per annum). On March 28, it started the commercial operations of its 12,000 tpd (tons per day) or 4MTPA clinker unit (kiln 3) at Beloda Bazar in Raipur district. The company has recommended a final dividend of Rs 45 per equity share of Rs 10 each for the financial year ended March 2022.

20,"Daily Voice | Sonam Srivastava of Wright Research advises caution on eMudhra IPO, expects tepid listing for Delhivery, but Venus at premium",markets," “eMudhra is India’s most significant licensed certifying authority. The company has issued over 50 million digital signature certificates through 88,457 channel partners. But it will list at a PE of 78.81x within a highly competitive industry. So, we advise investors to be cautious,” Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Thanks to retail investors, the IPO of Venus Pipes was subscribed 16.31 times on the final day. “We expect the stock to open at a premium. Venus Pipes will be an excellent addition to the listed stainless steel pipes and tubes segment with a strong export presence,” she said. However, Delhivery’s IPO hardly sailed through, and retail investors barely participated. “We expect the listing to be tepid and damaging as the current market hates high-growth tech stocks with negative earnings,” she said. Do you think the market has bottomed out after the recent correction, and is ready for a sharp upmove? The last six months have taught us that picking the market bottom is a futile exercise in adverse macroeconomic conditions. We are at a low point in the market despite a robust economy. Moreover, the rise in inflation worldwide, persistent geopolitical tensions, and worsening conditions in China are some things that still worry investors. Despite the sharp upward rally in the last week, no one can certainly say that the markets are ready to bounce back. These are the times to be cautious and exercise your risk management muscles. The telecom space, which is largely a two-player market now, has seen strong growth in ARPUs, especially after the tariff hikes in November last year. Do you expect more tariff hikes in the coming period, and are you bullish on these players? Both Bharti Airtel and Idea have posted increase in revenues and seen good days after announcing the tariff hikes and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Both Gopal Vittal of Bharti Airtel and Ravinder Thakkar of Idea have signalled that more hikes are coming in the next quarter. Telecom ARPUs have been sustainably low since Jio disrupted the space, and we will see them rising soon. The hikes will help the revenue and EBIDTA numbers of the two players. In this volatile market where rates rise, cash is king, and increasing cash flows won’t hurt anybody. The telecom sector is seeing a structural revival, and the 5G rollout will be exciting. We are watching this sector optimistically. The IT services space has corrected nearly 20 percent in the recent correction. Where do you see value in this space and should one stick to frontline players instead of mid-caps and small-caps? The IT services sector is buoyant structurally. But with rising margin concerns from a potential macro slowdown and increased exposure to the US, the industry earning cycle might be in trouble. JP Morgan even downgraded the sector and said that the peak revenue is behind us, and EBIT margins are trending down due to inflation and mean reversion. We think, IT is a decent bet while the US hikes rates, but the simultaneous debacle in the US markets has discouraged the sector. So, we are cautious here, and sticking to larger players might make sense. The auto space has been facing issues on the demand as well as supply sides. Should one start taking exposure to the space or wait for the situation to improve? The auto sector has been surprisingly robust over the last month amid the market decline, which might be due to mean reversion effects or because demand in the industry remains high. The auto sector is struggling on the supply side due to semiconductor shortages while people are still waiting for their cars. As inflation rises, demand is seen to be impacted, and global forces, especially the China showdown, which shrunk their auto demand by 40 percent, can impact this sector. The sector’s fate would be governed by the inflation numbers and the revival of consumer sentiment. We are not yet buying but watching this sector. LIC has seen a tepid performance on its listing day. Do you think the stock is still overpriced or is there an issue with the life insurance space as a whole? The valuations at which LIC got listed were cut from the previous numbers discussed but were still on the expensive side for the old world stock in an industry that is growing more and more competitive and digital. The tepid performance could be due to the broader bearish market dynamics due to inflationary pressures and tight monetary policy. In addition, insurance stocks across the board are weak as they anticipate lower demand. Therefore, LIC stockholders need to be patient and wait for the market to return. The BSE IPO index fell more than 30 percent in the last six months. What are your thoughts on the Indian IPO market that has seen several listings since last year, but around 40 percent of them are way below their issue prices, including new-age companies? The IPO market premium is primarily linked to the sentiment in the secondary markets. When the markets are euphoric, IPOs demand premium valuations, but no one likes an overvalued company in tough times, especially if the profits are low. The new-age companies face the same problem. They might have a long way to profitability, and in such volatile times, no one trusts exorbitant growth projections. Nevertheless, companies in attractive sectors with good profitability track records and reasonable valuations are still being lapped up by IPO investors. Therefore, we look at the IPO market to keep on bringing exciting companies to the listed space. What are your thoughts on the IPOs of eMudhra and Aether Industries? Do you expect muted listing for Delhivery, Venus Pipes, and Prudent Corporate? eMudhra is India’s most significant licensed certifying authority. The company has issued over 50 million digital signature certificates through 88,457 channel partners. But it will list at a PE of 78.81x within a highly competitive industry. So, we advise investors to be cautious. Click Here To Read All IPO News Aether Industries is a specialty chemicals manufacturer in India with solid revenue and growth numbers. Given the increasing focus on specialty chemicals in the Government of India's PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme and the China+1 strategy, we see this sector come in flavour soon. Prudent Corporate Advisory’s shares made a muted stock market debut with profit booking post listing. The stock opened for trading at Rs 660 and quickly slipped below Rs 550 levels. This shows that many investors joined the IPO only for the listing gains. Thanks to retail investors, the Venus Pipes IPO was subscribed 16.31 times on the final day, and we expect the stock to open at a premium. Venus Pipes will be an excellent addition to the listed stainless steel pipes and tubes segment with a strong export presence. Investors might dump the stocks on listing day to lock-in to the listing gains even after a positive listing. The Delhivery IPO hardly sailed through, and retail investors barely participated. We expect the listing to be tepid and damaging as the current market hates high-growth tech stocks with negative earnings.

0,"Commodities market to remain focused on economic numbers, central bank comments",markets," Ravindra Rao, VP- Head of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities The general trend seen in financial markets in the last few days was exit from riskier assets like equities and commodities to the safety of cash especially the dollar. We saw a brief break from the trend this week as the dollar index came off highs and recently battered assets like commodities, Japanese yen, and US bond saw some buying interest. Equities remained volatile and Chinese equities managed to test near one-month high. The change in trading interest shows renewed search for best investment amid increasing uncertainty. Global growth worries are high as central banks look to tighten monetary policy aggressively while inflation remains at elevated levels and China continues to struggle to get virus spread under control and Russia-Ukraine fighting continues to intensify with no major efforts to restart talks. Commodities attempted to stage some recovery this week gaining support from a correction in the dollar index, improvement in China's virus situation and China's measures to support the economy. The dollar has been on a steady rise since the start of the year on the back of safe haven buying and US Fed's monetary tightening expectations and has tested the highest level since 2002. The dollar's sharp rally made it vulnerable to profit taking which materialised amid some disappointing US economic data, correction in bond yields and hawkish comments from some other central banks. US housing, regional manufacturing indices and labour market data released this week disappointed. The US 10-year bond yield corrected from 2018 high as bonds benefitted from safe haven buying. Inflation has been rising globally and this has put pressure on central banks to act. European Central Bank's monetary policy account released this week showed increased debate as to how fast and how far they should tighten policy. Meanwhile, Swiss National Bank also attracted market attention as Thomas Jordan said policy makers are ready to act against inflation. While the US dollar has come off the highs, Fed's monetary tightening stance has kept a floor to the price. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed support for monetary tightening to get inflation under control. Financial markets got a brief jolt this week as Fed chairman Jerome Powell said that they will continue with rate hikes unless there are clear signs of improvement in inflation situation. One of the biggest concerns for commodities in the last few days was increasing economic stress on the Chinese economy owing to virus related restrictions. Outlook for Chinese economy still remains bleak as economic indicators highlighted the impact of restrictions. China's industrial production, retail sales and unemployment data released earlier this week disappointed. Market nerves calmed somewhat as the virus situation improved somewhat in China's Shanghai. Shanghai officials declared the city's epidemic under control and aim to reopen broadly and allow normal life to resume from June 1. Market confidence wavered as Shanghai found first cases outside quarantine in six days, raising questions over whether plans to loosen curbs there will be impacted. Once China starts lifting virus related restrictions, economic activity may improve. However, it is likely that authorities may take a gradual approach to avoid resurgence in cases. With increasing challenge from virus spread, China has also stepped up efforts to support the economy. Amid the latest move, the People's Bank of China cut the five-year loan prime rate, which is the reference rate for mortgages, from 4.6 to 4.45 percent to boost activity in real estate. Commodities attempted some recovery this week, but there is still uncertainty if this trend can continue. The dollar is off the highs but may continue to be supported by Fed's hawkish stance. Outlook for China also remains clouded unless the virus situation comes under control. Amid continuing debate about the impact of monetary tightening, the market focus will remain on economic numbers and central bank comments.

1,More than 100 smallcaps gain 10-50% as market bounces back in volatile week,markets," After losing four percent each in previous two weeks, Indian markets bounced back gaining three percent in the highly volatile week ended May 20 despite worries over rising inflation, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling and mixed global cues. For the week, BSE Sensex added 1,532.77 points (2.90 percent) to close at 54,326.39 while the Nifty50 rose 484.05 points (3.06 percent) to end at 16,266.2. The BSE Sensex and Nifty50 recovered some of their monthly losses but were still down nearly four percent in the month of May till now. On the sectoral front, BSE Metal index surged 7.3 percent, BSE Capital Goods index added 5.3 percent and BSE FMCG, Auto and Realty indices gained four to five percent. On the other hand, Information Technology index fell two percent. The BSE Small-cap index rose four percent, Mid-cap and Large-cap indices were up three percent each. ""The Nifty had a volatile week where it witnessed sharp swings in both the directions and ultimately posted a positive weekly close. The steep decline on May 19 was arrested near the swing low of 15,735. The March low of 15,671 offered additional support on the downside. Thus the index took a strong leap on the upside on May 20,"" Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, head of technical research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. ""With this, it filled up the recently created gap area on the daily chart. Going ahead, the index is set to test the upper end of a reverse falling channel and the swing high of 16,400 which is a key barrier to watch out for. On the flip side 16,100-16,000 will act as a near term support zone,"" he added. FIIs continued selling as they offloaded equities worth of Rs 11,401.34 crore while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth of Rs 9,472.91 crore. In May so far FIIs have sold equities worth Rs 44,102.37 crore and DIIs have bought shares worth Rs 36,208.27 crore. In this week, more than 100 smallcap stocks rose 10-50 percent with the following adding 20-50 percent: Nava Bharat Ventures, Uttam Sugar Mills, Welspun Corp, Orient Bell, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Datamatics Global Services, Elgi Equipments, JK Lakshmi Cement, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores, Vikas Lifecare, Honda India Power Products, Seamec, TGV Sraac, 63 Moons Technologies, HBL Power Systems, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Grauer and Weil (India), Tilaknagar Industries, Patel Engineering Company, Easy Trip Planners, Emami Paper Mills, IRB Infrastructure Developers, and National Fertilizers.  On the other hand, Birla Tyres, Future Retail, Amber Enterprises India, Muthoot Capital Services, Dr Lal PathLabs, Asian Granito India, Metropolis Healthcare, and Brightcom Group lost 10-22 percent. ""The Nifty 50 ended the week on a positive note and both the benchmark index and the Bank Nifty recovered from last week's lows. Despite the rebound, we feel the market has not reached its bottom since price patterns on the Nifty show that the uptrend has been significantly harmed. Similarly, a Head and Shoulder breakdown has been seen on the weekly chart of the S&P 500 index,"" said Yesha Shah, head of equity research at Samco Securities. ""Having said this, a short-term rebound cannot be ruled out and at this point it is unclear if the bounce will be a relief rally or the start of a fresh bullish surge."" ""Taking all of this into account, we recommend that traders keep a cautiously bullish stance for the coming week as long as the Nifty does not break below 15,700 levels,"" he added. Among midcaps, Adani Power, JSW Energy, Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Heavy Electricals, CRISIL, Balkrishna Industries, LIC Housing Finance, PI Industries added 10-17 percent. BSE 500 index rose over three percent led by Welspun Corp, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Elgi Equipments, JK Lakshmi Cement, Ruchi Soya Industries, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Adani Power and IRB Infrastructure Developers adding over 20 percent each. ""Nifty started this week around the 15800 mark and surpassed the 16000 mark, we saw a sharp upmove in the index towards 16400 in just couple of sessions. The sharp sell-off in the global markets then lead to a huge gap down on the weekly expiry day and the market resumed its downmove to end around 15800 again,"" said Ruchit Jain, lead research, 5paisa.com. ""However, it was not done with it yet, surprisingly the index again rallied sharply on the last trading session and it ended this volatile week above 16,250 with weekly gains of over three percent. ""It was one of the most difficult week for traders as markets have oscillated sharply on both the sides. The alternate bouts of buying and selling perplexed market participants as to the primary trend of the index. ""In our view, the recent activity in the Nifty where it has taken support several times as it approached 15,700-15,800 and has faced resistance around 16400 has changed the trend from down to sideways. The index has formed a broad range of 15,700-16,400 where we can see multiple supports and ’20 DEMA’ hurdle on the higher end i.e. around 16,400,"" Jain added. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Markets have been seeing a roller-coaster ride and the key is to manage the overnight risk. Going ahead, global cues, the last leg of earnings and updates on the Russia-Ukraine war will be on the radar. We reiterate our advice to focus more on managing risk and preferring hedged bets. Manish Shah, Independent Technical Analyst: Nifty is currently far away from its 50 and 20 period moving average. Sooner or later it will revert to the mean. Minor swing high in Nifty is at 16,400. A break above 16,400 should trigger a rally to 16,650-16,700. It is likely that the Nifty may be making a significant low and a strong thrust on the upside. Next week is expiry week. If Nifty manages to break above 16,400 in the early part of the week, the monthly expiry could be around 16,650-16,700. For a weekly expiry trader, this could be a good opportunity to be on the long side of the market.

2,"Implied volatility, an integral part of option premium: Shubham Agarwal",markets," Shubham Agarwal Implied Volatility or IV as it is popularly known is mentioned a lot in discussions about Options trading. IV is one such integral part of Options that may not be as important a driving force as the price of the underlying stock/index but it is required to be understood and considered while trading Options. Let us understand what IV is first and then its impact on Option prices along with our action with respect to IV. Option Premium is calculated using 5 following factors: 5. Volatility in the Underlying First 4 factors are known to each and every one of us and there is no disagreement in its value among any of us. However, the volatility figure is a bit tricky. This is not volatility that is posted by the underlying but the volatility that is expected of the underlying during the life of the Option. We don’t need to worry about calculating it since we already know the answer i.e. Option Premium. But, with the given Option Premium and 4 known factors we can definitely find out the Volatility Implied by the Premium by back calculation. Thus, found Volatility from given Premium is called Implied Volatility. Relationship: Impact of IV is fairly straight forward with Options being priced mathematically. Higher the Premium at a point in time and at price point in the Underlying, Higher will be the IV. Higher IV >> Higher Expected Volatility This helps with the relationship again (it is which came first Egg or Chicken dilemma). Higher Expected Volatility >> Higher IV >> Higher Premium Lower Expectation of Volatility >> Lower IV >> Lower Premium This relationship is very vividly visible during the times of results. Most of us must have seen this. Right after the Result of a company (which is expected to bring unknown development) we see all Options (Calls and Puts) premiums fall. This is the reduction in Expected Volatility since the unknown is over and hence the Premiums fall. The reason for this is Fall in Expected Volatility or Fall in IV. One more thing we should keep in mind is that Rise or Constructive move is always slower than the Fall or Destructive move. Hence, when there is no event in sight, we can easily observe that Rising Market has Falling IV and Falling market has Rising IV. Actionable: Remember the relationship Rise in IV >> Rise in Premium and Vice Versa. For a market turnaround trade I should be prepared that IV may fall with a constructive move and thereby the Premium may also fall due to a fall in IV. So, I will try and trade Options in Spread, Buy a Call and Sell a Higher Strike Call while trading a market turnaround to safeguard myself from a fall in premium due to fall in IV. Similarly, I should be careful in holding on to Buy Option position when the Result is announced, because there may or may not be a movement in the underlying but there will definitely be a fall in premium due to end of the unknown event. IV also has an analytical aspect but that is a separate discussion altogether. One must know that there is a significant aspect of IV a.k.a. expected volatility that impacts Option Premium. Hope this explains what the impact is and how to provide for it. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
3,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | People’s Bank of China rides to the rescue ,markets," Dear Reader, The Fed ‘put’ may be history, but the markets consoled themselves on Friday with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) ‘put’. The PBOC cut its five-year loan prime rate, the reference rate for mortgages, by 15 basis points in an attempt to prop up its beleaguered real estate sector. It was a welcome change from the gloomy news about higher inflation and policy tightening, and stocks gave a rousing cheer. In recent weeks, estimates of Chinese growth this year have been cut, thanks to its COVID curbs. Goldman Sachs cut its forecast to 4 percent while Bloomberg Economics put it as low as 2 percent. Nobody believes the official Chinese government forecast of 5.5 percent. In April, retail sales had contracted 11.1 percent from a year ago. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had predicted Chinese real GDP growth of 4.4 percent. Going by the IMF projections, China is forecast to contribute 32.4 percent of global growth this year, while the US contributes 31 percent. Chinese growth is therefore of immense significance for global growth. In The Eastern Window, old China hand Saibal Dasgupta wrote about the impact of the China slowdown on global supply chains. Real estate is a very important driver of Chinese growth, estimated to contribute 17-29 percent to Chinese GDP, depending on how it’s measured. A report that average new home prices in 70 major cities fell in April must have rung the alarm bells for the Chinese leadership. Premier Li Keqiang has been rooting for a monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy at every meeting. Xi Jinping, whose coronation as supreme leader for life is scheduled to take place this autumn, must also be worried. But how can China afford to cut interest rates at a time when the rest of the world is tightening? Well, producer price inflation, at 8 percent in April 2022, is at its lowest level in a year, while retail inflation moved up to a still low 2.1 percent because of supply disruptions caused by the COVID curbs. Producer prices lost momentum as demand fell on the one hand, while the government took measures to increase production. For instance, my colleague Ravi Ananthanarayanan pointed out that aluminium smelters were running at full capacity by end-April and output is expected to be even higher in May. It’s another matter, of course, whether the rate cut will bail out the Chinese real estate sector. There is after all a glut of housing and it wasn’t so long ago that Xi went to town with the slogan that houses are for living in and not for speculation. For the moment, though, the markets seem to have immense faith in the ability of the Chinese Communist Party to deliver results. The bounce may also be due to pessimism in the market having reached extremes, as the survey of fund managers by Bank of America showed, setting the stage for a bear market rally. But there’s no escaping the fact that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the major central banks will have a big impact on the markets, as V Anantha Nageswaran, the Indian government’s chief economic adviser, told us in an exclusive interview. Anantha Nageswaran also said India is better placed among the emerging market economies both for portfolio and direct investments. The strength of the US dollar, though, is a problem, as this FT story, free to read for MC Pro subscribers, says. There is nowhere to hide. If China eases policy while the US tightens, the pressure on the yuan could weigh on the rupee, although it’s also true that letting the rupee depreciate may not be a bad idea. The Indian economy is in a reasonably good shape, as our Economic Recovery Tracker shows. Indian banks have had bumper profits. Among companies, with business conditions getting back to normal, Avenue Supermarts saw a good recovery in sales in March. Price hikes and exports have helped Eicher Motors. Loan growth at the bottom of the pyramid has gained momentum, as seen from Bandhan Bank’s results. With a normal monsoon expected, tractor demand is expected to be strong. With the resumption of travel, the road ahead is smooth for luggage companies. ITC’s FMCG segment has done well and the full resumption of mobility is a tailwind for its cigarettes business. Barbeque-Nation Hospitality is accelerating new restaurant openings. The situation in Russia presents a long-term opportunity for Dr Reddy’s. Tariff hikes have led to a profit surge at Bharti Airtel. But inflation remains a problem, as seen from margin pressures at several firms, including Pidilite and tyre companies. Lupin’s Q4 performance was marred by pricing erosion in the US. Godrej Consumer Products’ international business dampened the show. And, as the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee show, more rate hikes are in the offing. How the government and RBI manage inflation, says Shyam Sekhar, is “central to the stability of the stock market. If we do far better than 2012-13, then we should be able to overcome this problem”. How should investors approach the markets then? In this tumultuous environment, investors need to take stock of the drivers of volatility. This FT piece argued it’s time to hold gold and commodities. Our analyses of SBI and Tech Mahindra stressed their attractive valuations after the market correction. My colleague Madhuchanda Dey looked at bond yields versus earnings yields as a way to figure out whether it’s time to bottom-fish. This piece said that after the investing excesses of the pandemic, it’s time to go back to basics. Staying in cash is not an option, because inflation will erode the value of your savings—taking no risk is therefore the biggest risk. My colleague Sachin Pal wondered whether we are in for a repeat of the 2008 meltdown in the markets. Start-up Street considered what start-ups should do as venture capital funding ebbs. In our constant endeavour to add value and help investors navigate asset markets, we have brought you GuruSpeak—where we can learn from successful traders; Crypto Conversations—we had a story on how to buy property in the Metaverse; FX Learn, on currency trading.

4,"Shree Cement Results Preview: Profit may decline 6-8%, revenue likely to grow 10%",markets," Shree Cement is expected to declare a year on year decline of 6-8 percent in standalone profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended March on May 21. However, revenues are expected to improve 10 percent. Experts expect the cement major to register a profit of Rs 710 – 740 crore for the quarter with revenues of Rs 4,360 – 4,380 crore. Growth in revenue will be aided by higher increase in blended realisations on a yearly basis but the marginal decline in volumes and the high base of the same quarter last year will result in muted year on year growth. Sequentially the Rajasthan based company is expected to post healthy growth of 23 percent in revenue aided by higher volumes while profit is expected to grow 45 percent due to higher volumes and stable realisations partially negated by rising variable costs. Brokerage views Brokerages expect the cement volumes to decline on year due to the high base of last year. On a sequential basis though volumes are expected to show remarkable growth. “We estimate volumes of 8 million tons, a decline of 3 percent YoY and growth of 22 percent on quarter factoring strong sequential recovery due to seasonality; however, high base of Q4FY21 are expected to keep the YoY growth muted”, a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. The brokerage estimates blended realizations to increase 13 percent on year and 1 percent quarter on quarter impacted by lower exit prices of Q3FY22 and back-ended price strength in Q4FY22. Experts expect 4-5 percent sequential increase in power-fuel cost led by higher pet coke/thermal coal prices in the past six months leading to ~1-3 percent quarter on quarter increase in costs/ton during the quarter. Gross margins are expected to be impacted due to the higher variable costs compared to the same period last year. Cement EBITDA/ton (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is likely to decline 6-8 percent on year but improve by 7-9 percent on quarter to Rs 1,345 – 1,375 per ton. The sequential growth in cement EBITDA/ton is likely to be led by a combination of higher realizations and operating leverage, partially offset by higher variable costs. EBITDA margins are expected in the range of 24.8-25.4 percent for the quarter which is a decline of 450-500 bps compared to last year period but on a sequential basis, there is a likely improvement of 150-200 bps. Estimates The brokerage firm JM Financial pegs the revenues for the quarter at Rs 4,365 crore with a year on year growth of 10 percent and a sequential growth of 23 percent. PAT is likely to come in at Rs 748 crore with a 3 percent on year decline but a sequential growth of 52 percent. Axis Securities has a revenue estimate of Rs 4,385 crore at a growth of 12 percent on year and 23 percent quarter on quarter. EBITDA margins for the quarter are likely at 25.6 percent resulting in a PAT of Rs 721 crore. It expects the PAT to decline 6 percent compared to the same period last year but on a sequential basis it sees the PAT improving by 46.5 percent. As per the estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities, the revenues for the company are seen improving by 10.3 percent year on year to Rs 4,364 crore, a sequential growth of 23 percent. EBITDA margins at 24.6 percent are seen declining by 525 bps from last year quarter. However, from the previous quarter of current fiscal, the margins are likely to improve by 140 bps. It forecasts a PAT of Rs 702 crore, declining by 8.5 percent year on year but increasing by 43 percent from the previous quarter. Shree Cement ended Rs 215.15 lower at Rs 22,001.20 on May 20 at The National Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 20 percent during the past one year and is down 14 percent over the past one month.

5,Wall Street ends mixed after punishing week,markets," Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy. The S&P 500 spent most of the session in negative territory and at one point was down just over 20% from its Jan. 3 record high close before ending down 18% from that level and flat for the day. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since reaching that January high, according to a common definition. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last down about 27% from its record close in November 2021. Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla tumbled 6.4% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple Google-owner Alphabet Inc down 1.3% and Nvidia losing 2.5%. Shares of Deere & Co dropped 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. Pfizer rose 3.6%, helping the S&P 500 avoid a loss for the day. Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp and Target Inc have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers. On Friday, Ross Stores plunged 22.5% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp gained 6.1% on strong 2023 revenue outlook. Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July. The S&P 500 edged up 0.01% to end the session at 3,901.36 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.30% to 11,354.62 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03% to 31,261.90 points. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.0%, the Dow lost 2.9% and the Nasdaq declined 3.8%. About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.0 billion shares, compared with a 13.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

6,"Global markets in ""unambiguous contrarian buy territory,"" Bank of America says",markets," The trillions wiped off global markets in recent weeks has triggered a contrarian 'buy' signal from BofA's closely-followed 'Bull & Bear' sentiment indicator, while emerging markets are seeing their toughest time since the peak of the COVID crash. Fears that inflation and fast-rising rates will send major economies into recession have sent global markets in a downward spiral with global equities losing close to 18% since the beginning of the year. It is the worst start to a year on recent record. BofA's analysts said their 'Bull & Bear' indicator had now moved into ""unambiguous contrarian buy territory"", given the huge redemptions in developed market stocks, riskier high-yield debt and emerging market bonds. The week saw the largest ouflows from emerging markets debt since March 2020 and the biggest withdrawals from high yield bonds in 14 weeks, at $6.1 billion and $4.3 billion respectively BofA noted, citing EPFR data. Across the equity space, Europe, which is being hit hardest by the Russia-Ukraine war, suffered a fourteenth week of withdrawals.

7,Russia to lift short-selling ban from June 1,markets," Russia's central bank will from June 1 lift a ban on short selling of securities and on buying of foreign currencies using credit leveraging, in moves to increase market liquidity as volatility has subsided, it said on Friday. Russia restricted trading in Russian assets in March, saying it wanted to protect investors' rights and ensure decisions were not driven by political pressure, after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. The short-selling ban led to a drop in turnover on the Moscow Exchange to 88 trillion roubles ($1.49 trillion) in April from 95.7 trillion roubles in the same month of 2021, data showed on Friday. The central bank said it would still limit the size of credit leveraging that a brokerage can offer its clients until the end of this year. The rouble has rallied to its strongest levels in years against the euro and dollar, which analysts attributed to EU countries preparing to pay Russia for gas and to capital controls imposed by Moscow. Russia is expected to ease those controls further. The central bank has said a ban on the sale of securities by non-residents helped to avoid extreme market volatility that could have caused mass defaults through a domino effect.

8,"As bear market looms, battered Wall Street seeks elusive 'Fed put'",markets," The Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates until it squashes the highest inflation in decades is darkening the outlook across Wall Street, as U.S. stocks stand on the cusp of a bear market and warnings of a recession grow louder. At issue is the so-called Fed put, or investors’ belief that the Fed will take action if stocks fall too deeply, even though it has no mandate to maintain asset prices. One oft-cited example of the phenomenon, which is named after a hedging derivative used to protect against market falls, occurred when the Fed halted a rate hiking cycle in early 2019 after a stock market tantrum. Also Read: Global stocks rebound despite unease over economy; dollar gains This time around, the Fed’s insistence that it will raise rates as high as needed to tame surging inflation has bolstered the argument that policymakers will be less sensitive to market volatility - threatening more pain for investors. read more A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers now expect the Fed to step in at 3,529 on the S&P 500, compared with expectations of 3,700 in February. Such a drop would constitute a 26% decline from the S&P’s Jan. 3 closing high. The index, which closed Friday at 3,901.36, is already down almost 19% from that high this year on an intraday basis - close to the 20% decline that would confirm a bear market, according to some definitions. ""The Fed has bigger fish to fry and that's the inflation problem,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes, who is increasing his cash levels. ""The 'Fed put' is kaput until the central bank is confident that they're no longer behind the curve."" As a result, some investors are digging in for a long slog. BofA’s survey showed cash allocations at a two-decade high, while bets against technology stocks stand at their highest since 2006. Strategists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, earlier this week published a “Recession manual for US equities” in response to client inquiries on how stocks will perform in a downturn. Barclays analysts said that numerous negative near-term catalysts mean the risks for stocks “remain firmly stacked to the downside."" The S&P 500 closed broadly unchanged on Friday, reversing a sharp intraday decline that had briefly put it into bear market territory. The index marked its seventh straight week of losses, the longest streak since 2001. Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, believes the index needs to fall at least another 15% for the Fed to slow its tightening, given that unprecedented monetary policy support helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows. ""The Fed is being very clear that there will be some pain ahead,"" he said. The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points and is expected to tighten monetary policy by 193 basis points this year. Investors will get more insight into the central bank's thinking when minutes from its last meeting are released on May 25. Some worry the Fed risks exacerbating volatility if it does not heed possible danger signs from asset prices. Analysts at the Institute of International Finance said stocks may be subject to the same type of selling that rocked markets in late 2018, when many investors believed the Fed tightened monetary policy too far. “In the past, rising uncertainty and mounting recession risk have had important effects on investor psychology, making markets less tolerant of monetary policy tightening that is seen as no longer warranted,” IIF analysts wrote on Thursday. “The risk of a similar market tantrum (to 2018) is rising again now as markets fret about global recession.” There have been signs of resilient sentiment among investors. For example, the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is elevated but below levels it reached during previous major selloffs. read more And the ARK Innovation Fund ARKK.K, which became emblematic of the pandemic rally, has brought in net positive inflows of $977 million over the last six weeks, Lipper data showed.

9,Global stocks rebound despite unease over economy; dollar gains,markets," Global equity markets rebounded after the S&P 500 pared losses that briefly took it into bear market territory, and the dollar gained on Friday, as investor unease about Federal Reserve policy tightening to curb inflation kindled fears of a recession. Shares rebounded earlier in Europe and Asia after China cut a key lending benchmark to bolster its weakening economy, helping initially to drive gains on Wall Street. China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. Also Read: Indian markets should be moving upwards next week, says IIFL’s Sanjiv Bhasin While a late-day rally stopped the S&P 500 from confirming a bear market, the gloom on Wall Street led the benchmark to fall for the seventh consecutive week, an event that has occurred only five times since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How long the downdraft in equities lasts will depend on when inflation breaks, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly,"" Tuz said, referring to poor earnings results at Walmart Inc and Target Corp. Also Read: Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy The S&P 500 closed up 0.01% after being down 2.27% at one point or below the level would confirm a bear market – a 20% decline from its Jan. 3 record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite, already in bear territory, fell 0.3%. Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes. ""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Auth said. ""You’re seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it’s just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added. MSCI’s gauge of stocks in 47 countries closed up 0.37%, but still fell for the seventh consecutive week, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.73%. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 6.5 basis points to 2.790%. Fed funds futures were firmer, suggesting that the U.S. rates market has pulled back a bit from some of its more extreme rate hike estimates. The rates market has priced in a fed funds rate of 2.783% at the end of next year, compared with the current level of 0.83%. It was as high as 2.9% two weeks ago. The day’s gains for the dollar were not enough to erase sharp losses from earlier this week that pulled the greenback away from a five-year high against the common currency, on worries its months-long rally may have been overdone. The dollar has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety amid a rout across markets due to fears of soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed and the war in Ukraine. The dollar index rose 0.146%, with the euro down 0.3% at $1.0554. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09% to 127.92 per dollar. Euro zone bond yields were higher after two days of hefty falls as risk sentiment improved following China’s rate cut. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield rose 0.1 basis point to 0.9450%, below last week’s eight-year high of 1.189%. Markets are pricing in 38 basis points of tightening from the European Central Bank by its July meeting. This suggests a 25 basis-point hike is fully priced in and markets see around a 50/50 chance of an additional 25 basis-point move. Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth will hurt demand. U.S. crude futures settled $1.02 higher at $113.23 and Brent rose 51 cents to settle at $112.55 a barrel. Gold edged up, heading for its first week of gains in five weeks on persistent worries over economic growth and the dollar’s decline over the week. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,842.10.

10,"S&P 500 on pace to confirm bear market, falls 20% from record close",markets," The benchmark S&P 500 index is trading down 20% from its Jan. 3 record close in volatile trading on Friday, as investors fretted over the impact of rising inflation on earnings and the fallout of interest rate hikes on economic growth. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is already in a bear market, down 30.7% from its record close in November 2021. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary and industrials down 3.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Apple Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Nvidia Corp and Tesla slid between 2.5% and 9.9%, weighing the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Both the indexes had climbed above 1% in morning trading. Shares of Deere & Co tumbled 12.1% and were the biggest drag on the industrial sector after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more ""In this process of a bear market, it is very common to have these intraday swings and counter cyclical rallies in it,"" said Will Nasgovitz, chief executive officer at Heartland Advisors. ""We are going to probably see a bear market (in S&P 500). The market is reflecting that the economy is not standing extremely tall, there are some cracks in the foundation."" Disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart Inc and Target Inc rattled market sentiment this week, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. The three major indexes are down between 15.1% and 28.6% so far this year as investors adjust to supply-chain snarls, lockdowns in China, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the Ukraine conflict and the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates. Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July. At 12:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 439.27 points, or 1.41%, at 30,813.86, the S&P 500 was down 69.83 points, or 1.79%, at 3,830.96, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 291.39 points, or 2.56%, at 11,097.11. Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session. Ross Stores plunged 23.8% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp gained 3% on strong 2023 revenue outlook. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.85-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

""Friday’s strong move can also be interpreted to conclude that the fall of the last Thursday’s session was just a reaction to the negative global cues, provided the Nifty witnesses a follow-through buying in the next trading session. In that scenario, the initial hurdle shall be around 16,400 levels and beyond that test of 20-day SMA cannot be ruled out."" It is critical that the index to sustain above 16,000, below which weakness can be expected with initial target of 15,775.

15,"Taking Stock | Market bounces back; Sensex, Nifty gain 3%; metal, pharma, banks lead charge",markets," The Indian benchmark made a smart recovery from the previous day’s battering, recouping the losses and ended nearly 3 percent higher supported by strong global cues and buying across the sectors. At close, the Sensex was up 1,534.16 points, or 2.91 percent, at 54,326.39, and the Nifty was up 456.80 points, or 2.89 percent, at 16,266.20. Asian markets opened high after China cut the five-year loan prime rate to 4.45 percent from 4.6 percent to bolster growth, amid indications that the Covid situation had begun to ease in the financial hub of Shanghai. ""The market displayed a confident yet calm rally throughout the day, supported by fortified global markets, especially the Asian market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. A positive start for Asian peers saw Indian shares open higher and the indices extended the gains as the day progressed, finishing a tad below intraday highs. The Sensex and the Nifty touched highs of 54,396.43 and 16,283.05 during the day. For the week, BSE Sensex rose 1,532.77 points, or 2.90 percent, and the Nifty added 484.05 points, or 3.06 percent. Investors got richer by Rs 4,92,349.47 crore, as the market capitalisation of BSE listed companies rose to Rs 2,54,11,537.52 crore on May 20 from Rs 2,49,19,188.05 crore the previous day. ""The Chinese central bank cut a key interest rate to support growth, injecting optimism into emerging markets,"" Nair said. With concerns about slowdown and rate hikes across the globe, investors will continue to move with caution. Value stocks should do well during this consolidation period, he said. Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Reliance Industries, JSW Steel, Nestle India and Tata Motors were among the top Nifty gainers, while losers included Shree Cements and UPL. All the sectoral indices ended in the green. Nifty bank, metal, pharma, PSU bank, FMCG, auto and energy indices were up 2-4 percent. Also Read: Nilesh Shah lists three reasons for FII selloff Stocks and sectors On the BSE, metal, healthcare, capital goods, and realty indices rose 3-4 percent each.

A long build-up was seen in BHEL, Sun TV and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, while a short build-up was witnessed in Container Corporation, PI Industries and Godrej Consumer Products. Welspun Corp, ITC and Hindustan Aeronautics were among the stocks that touched their 52-week high on the BSE.

However, following global cues, the Indian equity markets witnessed large volatility. The metal sector rebounded sharply after a steep correction in recent weeks. BSE IT index was down in an otherwise positive market this week. FIIs continued their selling in India. Markets remained wary of global growth-inflation expectations. With the result season entering the last leg, the focus will be more on the macro data points. Monetary policy tightening action by central banks globally amid high inflation will continue to weigh on market sentiments. Prashanth Tapse, Vice President (Research), Mehta Equities Led by Reliance Industries and Tata Motors, bulls came back with vengeance, primarily buoyed by a fall in the US treasury bond yields and the US dollar Index. Another positive takeaway was the all-round buying—from FMCG, IT to metal stocks. Interestingly, the gains came despite the overnight fall in Wall Street amid fears of inflation and waning hopes for the US and global economic recovery. The technical picture has shifted to neutral and positive following the aggressive spike during the day, with all bullish eyes on the Nifty’s biggest hurdles at the 16,411 mark. Expect a waterfall of selling only below the 15,951 mark. Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President-Technical Research, Kotak Securities The Market did a U-turn from the previous day’s slump, as bargain hunting following the recent crash and recovery in other Asian indices bolstered the sentiment at home. China's central bank cutting the five-year loan prime rate and easing of Covid restrictions also provided a major leg-up to the market. Technically, after a sharp price correction, the Nifty eventually took the support near 15,750 and bounced back sharply. On the daily chart, the index formed a double bottom formation and, on the weekly charts, after a long time, it formed a long bullish candle, indicating a further uptrend. On the weekly charts, the Nifty reclaimed 16,000 and is comfortably trading above the 10-day simple moving average (SMA). The reversal formation is likely to continue if the index succeeds to trade above 16,000 and above it, it can move up to 16,400. The upside may continue and lift the index to 16,550. However, below 16,000, the upside would be vulnerable and the index could slip to 15,800-15,700.

16,"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | GST: A simple, reliable tax still a distant dream?",markets," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The Goods and Services Tax is widely acknowledged as one of the most important reforms implemented in India in the past decade. However, almost five years since it was first introduced, the dream of a simple and reliable tax structure still seems far away. What’s added to the muddle now is the Supreme Court ruling on a case which among other things made the point that the recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the states and the central government. Now, that might seem to be just a reiteration of what’s already there in the law. Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said as much after the apex court judgment. On the other hand, critics of the tax (or the way the tax has been implemented) say the order restores the power of the states. Finance ministers of states ruled by non-BJP parties have also welcomed the judgment and said it will boost cooperative federalism. Where the Supreme Court judgment acquires significance is in the way the recommendations of the GST Council are implemented. So far, even if the states have had differences, they have stuck to the recommendations of the Council. Now, some states may well be emboldened to step out of line since the recommendations are not binding. This threatens the concept of ‘one nation, one tax’, the most attractive selling point of GST that replaced a complicated indirect tax structure with multiple levies. The ruling also comes at a particularly delicate time. The compensation cess arrangement — wherein states are compensated by the Centre for revenue shortfall —is coming to an end this year. This increases the scope for further friction between the Centre and states. To be sure, in a huge federal democracy like India, there will always be teething troubles for complex laws, especially those involving revenue sharing. But the apex court ruling should act as a trigger for the Centre and states to come together and work as one, not only to increase revenues, but also stop a potential flood of litigation that can act as a drag on the nascent economic recovery. A recovery in GST revenues in recent months is a welcome trend and the two can work together to build it up further.

17,Moneycontrol Market Sentiment Survey | Fund managers see scope for up to 15% further fall in Indian equities,markets," Majority of domestic asset managers see scope for up to 15 percent further fall in benchmark – Nifty 50 and BSE-Sensex – from current levels amid macroeconomic volatility and tightening global monetary policy, according to the latest edition of Moneycontrol’s Market Sentiment Survey. The survey saw participation from 11 fund managers managing assets worth Rs 10 lakh crore. Domestic stock indices have already corrected more than 11 percent from their record highs hit in October 2021 but have outperformed other major markets like the US, China and the European Union in that period. If the worst-case scenario of 15 percent correction from the current level of the Nifty 50 played out, the index would stand below the 14,000 points mark giving up more than 25 percent from the record highs.   That said, one in three fund managers polled expected a rebound rally in the market after months of consolidation in a 3,000-point range. In terms strategy, four in five fund managers said that they will buy every dip in the market reflecting their optimism for long-term returns and overall economic growth.  The optimism of fund managers of strong long-term returns in the market stems from their expectation of Nifty 50 earnings rising 10-15 percent in 2022-23. More than 90 percent of the respondents saw 10-15 percent growth in earnings as compared to 75 percent in the April survey.  Given the volatility, banks and fast-moving consumer goods companies emerged as the top choice of surveyed fund managers for seeking refuge from the ongoing market volatility. Those two sectors were followed by information technology and automobiles. In terms of taking a contrarian bet in the market, 54.5 percent of the participating fund managers recommended going overweight on automobile companies’ stocks while 27.3 percent suggested going underweight on commodity producers.  On the macroeconomic front, two in three fund managers expected the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee to raise interest rates by another 100-125 basis points that will leave the repo rate at 5.4-5.65 percent. Earlier this month, the MPC raised the interest rate by 40 basis points following an emergency inter-policy meeting.

Here's your look at the week ahead from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee, and Karin Strohecker in London. 1/ FED THINKING Can the Federal Reserve tame the worst U.S. inflation in decades without dragging the economy into a recession? The bank's meeting minutes on May 25 will offer clues. Chair Jerome Powell is confident the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing"" — words that are little solace to equity markets as recession warnings from big Wall Street banks pile up. Having raised rates by 75 basis points since March, the Fed is expected to hike another 50 bps in July. Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to tame inflation. The minutes will show how tenacious policy makers expect inflation to be and whether growth is resilient enough to face much tighter monetary policy. 2/ A BEAR HUG Wall Street is melting. Major stock market indexes are in the grip of bear market territory with S&P 500 down some 19%, the high flying Nasdaq has lost more than a quarter from a November 2021 peak. And there's no respite in sight: Barclays and Goldman predict further pain for equities as corporate margins suffer from surging inflation. The selloff is widespread. Since the bond bull market peak in March 2020, a constant duration 30-year U.S. Treasury bond lost half its value, and safe-haven gold is down 6% this quarter. Surging volatility means even hardened stock pickers are reluctant to take big bets. Retail and institutional investors are also bearish. A U.S. retail investment sentiment index is close to a March 2009 low while fund managers are running their highest cash levels since September 2011. 3/ PIVOT POINT Forward-looking Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan, and euro area is worth paying attention to. And more so than usual with central banks caught between surging inflation and its impact on consumers amid a darkening growth outlook, hurt by China's COVID-lockdowns and war in Ukraine. China bounced back quickly from an initial 2020 pandemic slump thanks to bumper exports and factory production, but the current downturn could be harder to shake off. Entrenched in their inflation fight, policymakers may reach a pivot point in the coming months where they have little choice but to focus on recession risk. PMIs have held up well recently, but might show how close that turning point is. 4/ EARLY MOVERS CATCHING UP They were early movers, but the race is on for central banks in New Zealand and Korea to stay ahead of a Fed hot on their heels with some big-step hikes. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely seen raising rates by a half-point again on Wednesday to tame inflation, though risks to the economy are rising with recent homebuyers feeling the pain of higher mortgage rates. Korea's new central bank governor roiled markets by flagging a half-point increase before his maiden meeting on Thursday. Falling behind the curve could squeeze the fragile won, sending imported food and energy prices soaring. One of the few remaining holdouts, Bank Indonesia, is tipped to stay put a little longer when meeting on Tuesday. 5/ RUSSIA FACES DEFAULT, AGAIN The prospect of a Russian sovereign default is back given a deadline for a U.S. license allowing Moscow to make payments expiring on May 25 and $100 million in interest payments due a couple of days after. Russia's $40 billion of sovereign bonds are just one of the flashpoints after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow. Also pressing is whether gas will keep flowing to Europe as firms struggle to confirm how they can legally buy gas if they have to pay in roubles with payments due from May 20. The EU has advised companies against opening rouble accounts but stopped short of saying that this would breach its sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas.

20,"Exclusive Interview: Blackstone Real Estate bullish on India, sees office rentals firming up",markets," Blackstone Real Estate is the largest office space owner in India with a commercial real estate portfolio valued at $20 billion. Kenneth Caplan, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, and Tuhin Parikh, head of real estate at Blackstone India, told Nisha Poddar that they are bullish on India investments and see an all around recovery in office rentals, malls and logistics to pre-COVID levels. Excerpts from an exclusive conversation. Caplan: From a macro standpoint, we are in this uncertain time, with a more challenging environment, and we have COVID still creating disruptions. We have geopolitical conflicts happening, with rising inflation and rising interest rates and that is creating a more challenging backdrop and challenging environment. In terms of what is driving that, we have demand that is increasing. I am based in New York and in the US we are seeing economy reopening, a tight job market, a lot of fiscal stimulus that is stimulating a lot more demand than supply can keep up with and that’s triggering inflation. With higher inflation we are seeing higher interest rates and with higher interest rates we are seeing the US Fed trying to tamp that down and that’s creating an environment where people are questioning how much of that tightening do you have and what does that mean for growth. Generally we are seeing slowing growth in parts of the US, slowing growth in parts of Europe obviously again with the Ukraine situation and slowing growth in other parts of the world as well, but here in India we are seeing greater growth. You are seeing higher inflation and some higher interest rates but you are also seeing higher level of growth which is actually really encouraging and positive. Tuhin, here in India you are the largest owner of office space, how is that shaping up at the moment given the new change in the macro environment. Being a $20 billion portfolio manager, what are you looking at? Tuhin Parikh: As Kenneth mentioned we are highly thematic investors, so we invest in what are long-term trends -- so in office, the trend that we are investing in is the fact that the growth of the ITs and offshoring business outsourcing in India has accelerated during Covid. We had work from home issues but hiring places doubled in India in the past couple of years -- that’s an extremely good underpinning of the fundamentals or office business and we are seeing that now as people are coming back to office, demand for offices is actually quite strong and we are seeing that recovery across the entire portfolio in office; retail world recovery has been the strongest so far. People are going out to shop, to consume, to see movies, malls are performing much better than they were at their 2019 peak. Newest portfolio, of which we are the largest owners, warehousing, where the e-commerce tailwinds and GST uniformalisation of the Indian economy are really propelling new tenants to come in and take up space. Now there’s a hybrid model but the vacancies it seems have been dropping, so how are the rental prices stacking up Parikh: When Covid hit obviously, the world came to a standstill -- people didn’t know what was happening at that point in time. There was a high level of uncertainty, whether people would come back to office or what would happen. I think two trends have come out, people may want more flexibility in their work-life, the fact that office is a centre of your work-life has also become a reality -- office being a part of people’s lives is not going away. Given rental pressures, inflation is increasing the cost of producing the same assets and the interest rate is reducing the amount of development people can do, therefore we actually see rentals firming in India because replacement costs are going up. The same office building takes 20-30 percent more to develop than it took 2-3 years ago, that’s pretty good fundamentals for existing stuff that we own. Which are the new areas you are focusing on for more investment? Caplan: Hotels are an area we have been investing in since the beginning of our existence, we have been investing in real estate for 30 years. It is what we have done from the beginning, we actually have a number of hotel investments here in India -- it is an area we are globally very enthusiastic about and that would include India. Data centres as well, frankly. In data centres we bought a company called QTS in the US last year and it had great initial success, not only the portfolio but also growing that business and we look for similar opportunities here in India. And we are studying other areas to grow as well. Those are two good examples and again that’s partly why I am here and we are constantly looking at where are those opportunities, where are those strong tailwinds. The good neighbourhoods are where we wanna invest. How is India placed when it comes to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) compliance especially in portfolio companies?

0,What are investors supposed to trust in now?,markets," Merryn Somerset Webb

I’m not often glad I am no longer the young person in the room. This month I am. If you have only been knocking around in markets for, say, 15 years, you are seeing the collapse of everything that you have been told is true and have also observed to be true about markets.

It turns out that quality growth stocks do not always outperform; that the Federal Reserve will not always step in to protect your wealth;..."
1,eMudhra IPO opened today: Should you subscribe?,markets," eMudhra Ltd  is a licensed certifying authority that issues digital certificates to individuals and institutions for ITR filings, banking transactions and the like. The company was incorporated on June 16, 2008, as a wholly owned subsidiary of 3i Infotech Ltd, and it enjoyed a market share of 37.9 percent in the digital signature certificates segment in FY21. In FY20, it was 36.5 percent. The company, which works closely with large government and banking customers, including more than 20 public and private sector banks and state governments, has launched its maiden public offering today (May 20). The subscription period will close on May 24 (Tuesday). Features of the offer The company intends to garner Rs 413 crore through the IPO. Of this, there will be a fresh issue of equity shares to the tune of Rs 161 crore. An offer for sale (OFS) of 9,835,394 equity shares will be worth Rs 252 crore. Post the issue, the promoter shareholding will fall 18.16 percent -- to 61.03 percent from 79.19 percent. The price band has been fixed between Rs 243 and 256 per equity share, with a face value Rs 5 each. Of the total offer size, 50 percent of the net offer will be reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), 35 percent for retail investors, and the remaining 15 percent for non-institutional investors. Brokerage recommendations Brokerages recommend investors to exercise caution while subscribing to the issue. They say only those investors who have a high risk appetite should go for the issue. The company has its inherent strength of being the largest licensed certifying authority in India. It is a one-stop shop solution provider in secure digital transformation, and it has a diverse, long-standing and growing customer base. It has partnerships with leading Indian and global channel partners and enterprise solution partners. But there are concerns about the prospects of the company. According to a report from Angel One, the company’s success will be largely dependent on its ability to anticipate, adapt and respond effectively to the technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing regulations as well as R&D. It is highly dependent on technology and operates in a highly competitive industry. The brokerage says the scale of operation for the company is relatively modest and the digital security and paperless transformation market is highly competitive. “At the upper end of the price band, the post-issue FY22 annualised P/E works out to 49.0x, which, we believe, is factoring in the positives,” it said. However, taking into account the concerns highlighted earlier, it recommended a ‘neutral’ rating. COVID-19 has forced organisations to adopt digital solutions like digital identity, security and paperless transformation solutions faster. “We feel that this trend will continue and players like eMudhra, which is a one-stop shop player in secure digital transformation, is expected to benefit from the growth in the addressable market,” said a report from Choice Broking. While highlighting the concerns related to the company, it said that the company is prone to risks due to, “unfavourable government policies and regulations, difficulty in adapting to the rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, and difficulty in expanding international operations and rise in competition”. Since there are no listed peers with a similar business, peer comparison is not feasible. “At the upper price band of Rs 256, the company is demanding a P/E multiple of 114.5x (to its FY21 earnings of Rs 2.2 per share), which seems to be high,” the report said. “Annualising the 9MFY22 performance, the demanded P/E multiple comes out to be 49x and considering the current turbulence in the global equity market, we assign a ‘subscribe with caution’ rating for the issue,” the report said. Brokerage firm Arihant Capital Markets recommends that only investors with high-risk appetite can ‘subscribe’ to the IPO. “At the upper price band, the issue has been offered at a P/E of 44x to its FY22E annualised EPS of Rs 5.8 (9MFY22 EPS was INR 4.4)”, it said. That said, eMudhra reported revenue from operations of Rs 131.59 crore for FY21 -- up 13 percent from Rs 116.45 crore in FY20. For the nine months ended December 2021, the company clocked Rs 137.24 crore in revenues. The company has consistently achieved a double-digit growth in profit after tax (PAT) since FY19. It recorded a PAT of Rs 18.4 crore in FY20. This jumped 38 percent to Rs 25.36 crore in FY21. Profit for the nine months ended December 2021 was at Rs 303.34 crore. Looking after the decent financial performance of the company and the unique business model, Hem Securities recommended a ‘subscribe’.

2,"Sensex, Nifty up 2.5% each as China cuts key lending rates, FM foresees 8.9% GDP growth for FY23",markets," The Indian stock market recouped the previous day’s losses and was almost 2.5 percent higher around noon on May 20 on strong global cues after China cut key lending rates. At 11.49 am, the Sensex was up 1,305.79 points, or 2.47 percent, at 54,098.02, and the Nifty was trading 396.40 points, or 2.51 percent, higher at 16,205.80. All sectoral indices were in the green, with auto, financials, capital goods, FMCG, healthcare, metals and realty indices adding 2-3 percent each. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices are up over a percent each. Here are the factors pushing the market higher: 1 China cuts key lending rates China cut its five-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 15 basis points on May 20, a sharper cut than expected, as authorities seek to cushion an economic slowdown, though it left the one-year LPR unchanged. The five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. Senior officials have pledged further measures to fight a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy, hit by COVID-19 outbreaks that prompted stringent measures and mobility restrictions and causing huge disruptions to activity, according to Reuters. The Chinese central bank has pledged to step up support for the slowing economy but analysts say the room to ease policy could be limited by worries about capital outflows, as the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Catch all the market action on our live blog 2 Strong Asian markets Asian markets were trading on a robust note as China cut key lending rates to stimulate the economy. Among the Asian names, Hang Seng added over 2 percent followed by Kospi, Nikkei and Sanghai adding over a percent each. SGX Nifty was trading at 16,177 level, up 392 points or 2.48 percent at 11.21 am. Also read: Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy 3 FM signals speedy recovery, projects 8.9% GDP growth India's economic growth is likely to be robust at 8.9 percent in the current financial year, reflecting the country's strong resilience and speedy recovery, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said. She also expressed confidence that India will continue to achieve a high growth rate in the next financial year as well, the finance ministry said in a statement. The finance minister said India's economic growth in the current financial year has been robust and is estimated to be 8.9 percent, the highest among all large economies. 4 All sectors in the green All sectoral indices are trading in the green, with auto, financials, healthcare, realty, metals, oil & gas and capital goods indices adding 2 percent each. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices traded higher by over a percent each. RIL, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the top positive contributors, while Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS and ITC were the most active stocks. About 2394 shares advanced, 598 declined, and 115 shares remained unchanged. Technical views VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services The excessive volatility in the market is broadly due to two reasons. Te market has discounted severe monetary tightening by the US central bank, which is likely to take the Fed funds rate to around 3 percent in 2023. It has not fully discounted the probability of the US economy slipping into recession in 2023. Till there is clarity on the second issue, the “risk-off, risk-on mode” in the market is likely to continue in the near term. It may take a few weeks for the markets to stabilise. It is important to appreciate the fact that the dominant feature of this market is bearish in the short term. Nasdaq is 30 percent down from the peak and S&P 500 is trading 19 percent lower from its highs. These are reflections of weakness in the market. FIIs are likely to continue selling since India is the only emerging market where they are sitting on good profits and the market provides the liquidity to sell. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel One The opening was painful on May 19 as the Nifty started 300 points lower on massive overnight selloff in US bourses. It caught a lot of momentum traders on the wrong foot who had carried over their longs after a sharp rebound the previous day. But fortunately, there was no major damage seen during the day as compared to the global screen. Eventually, the tragic weekly expiry day ended with over two and half a percent cut to the previous close. At this juncture, it’s better to take one step at a time. As far as levels are concerned, 16,000–16,100 once again become a sturdy wall and till the time, it does not get surpassed, we are likely to see selling pressure at higher levels.

4,Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy,markets," Domestic commodity producers soared on May 20 after the world’s largest commodity consumer China cut its key lending rates by a record quantum to stimulate the economy ravaged by the latest outbreak of the COVID-19 and reemergence of lockdowns. Shares of domestic producers such as JSW Steel, Hindustan Copper, Tata Steel, Vedanta, National Aluminum Company, SAIL, and Hindalco Industries soared 2-7 percent in the morning trade. Futures of several metals in China soared 3-10 percent earlier in the day on expectations of more stimulus for the construction sector that will boost consumption of commodities. Follow our live blog for the latest on the market China's surprise rate cut forced traders to cover the short positions in several metal companies' stocks due to overall concerns over global growth. Indian producers will benefit from the surge in international prices of commodities, which is likely to feed into domestic prices. In recent weeks, domestic metal prices have softened following a steep correction in global commodities on fears of demand slowdown led by China. Indian companies will also benefit from higher exports to China as and when demand picks up in that country, analysts said. Indian companies have ramped up exports over the past two years as domestic volume growth remained muted.

5,SEBI has developed algos to spot front running by employees at funds and brokerages: Sources,markets," The incidence of front running by a fund manager and a trader at a mutual fund hasn't come as a complete surprise to SEBI, as per sources close to the market regulator. These sources say the regulator has been using its database to spot front running based on synchronized movement in prices of stocks purchased by funds, on the day of purchase. The regulator had been alerted to such bad apples by market participants on various occasions. The big problem was to first spot the front running and then prove it. For the past few months, SEBI has been using artificial intelligence on its data trove to identify such synchronized stock moves on the days of purchase of stocks by funds.

9,Rupee surges 7 paise to 77.49 against US dollar in early trade,markets," The rupee appreciated 7 paise to 77.49 against the US dollar in opening trade on Friday as crude oil prices retreated from the elevated levels.

10,Prudent Corporate Advisory Services debuts at a premium of 4%,markets," Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Ltd (Prudent), an independent retail wealth management services group in India, made its debut on the bourses at a premium on May 20, the listing day. The stock opened at Rs 660, at a premium of 4.7 percent to its issue price of Rs 630 on the BSE, while the listing price on the NSE was Rs 650. Volatility and negative market sentiments impacted the listing of the one of the top mutual fund distributors. On May 19, the Indian stock markets tanked more than 1,400 points, wiping off over Rs 6.4 lakh crore of investor wealth in a single day. The after-effects might weigh upon the stock’s listing today. The shares of the company that offers digital wealth management solutions through platforms such as FundzBazar, PrudentConnect, Policyworld, WiseBasket and CreditBasket climbed/declined xx percent on May 20, the listing day. Most of the brokerages had suggested investors to exercise caution while subscribing to the issue. The issue did not receive a robust response from investors and was subscribed 1.22 times its size of Rs 538.61 crore. Its QIB portion was subscribed 1.26 times, while the portion reserved for non-institutional investors got a subscription of 0.99 times. Retail investors did not evince much interest and subscribed 1.29x the portion reserved for them. The employees of the company lapped up 1.23 times of their allotted portion. Experts are of the opinion that higher valuations demanded by the company for the issue was among the main reasons for the lacklustre response to the IPO. Fair valuations would have shown a better response, they said. The competitive intensity in financial product distribution industry has become more intense with entry of lot of fin-tech players. “The company might face challenges in maintaining its margins at 25 percent going forward,” a report from Choice Broking said. The brokerage found the demanding valuations quite stretched. “We believe the demanding valuation at Rs 2,608 crore is expensive leaving no margin of safety for investors in highly competitive financial products distribution industry,” it said. The key strengths of the company lies in the fact that it has consistent track record of profitable growth due to a highly scalable, asset-light and cash-generative business mode. It uses innovation and technology to improve investor and partner experience and has a growing independent financial products distribution platform. The company operates in an underpenetrated Indian asset management industry that has averaged a compounded annual growth rate of more than 20 percent. The offer was entirely an offer-for-sale of up to 8.55 million shares by shareholders and promoters. The company will not get any proceeds from the issue. Wagner will sell up to 8.28 million shares or 50 percent of its stake and Shirish Patel will sell around 2.68 lakh shares. Wagner holds 40 percent stake, while Patel has 3.15 percent stake in the firm. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
11,Gold Prices Today: Experts expect yellow metal to edge higher amid volatility on global macro concerns,markets," Gold edged lower on Friday in international markets but prices were still set for their first weekly gain since mid-April, as the dollar receding from two-decade highs and mounting concerns over US economic growth revived safe-haven demand. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,838.81 per ounce by 0258 GMT, tracking an uptick in the dollar on the day. US gold futures edged 0.1 percent lower to $1,839.30.

Precious metals prices gained as the US dollar index and benchmark Treasury yield fell more than one percent in the previous session. US spot power and natural gas prices soared near their higher levels over several parts of the country supporting the prices of precious metals. Selling pressure in the global equity market spurs safe haven demand and makes gold prices attractive for investors.

Gold prices rebounded with dollar decline and fall in US bond yields. The dollar index fell below the 103 mark while 10 year US Treasury yields fell to 2.85 percent. Global economic growth worries are weighing on the dollar despite hawkish US Fed. Higher inflation may continue to support gold prices in medium term. We expect gold prices to trade sideways to up for the day with Comex Spot gold support at $1820 and resistance at $1850 per ounce. MCX Gold June futures support lies at Rs 50200 and resistance at Rs 50800 per 10 gram. Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Gold and silver prices on May 19 logged significant gains, boosted by sharply falls in US dollar index and slight decline in US Treasury yields. Amid growing weakness in the US labour market, a more than expected number of American workers are applying for first-time unemployment benefits which also appears to be adding to gold’s technical bullish momentum. We expect bullion prices to remain volatile in today’s session. Gold has support at $1822-1810, while resistance is at $1850-1862. Silver has support at $21.48-21.20 and resistance at $22.05-22.30. In rupee terms gold has support at Rs 50,330–50,110, while resistance is at Rs 50,740–50,950. Silver has support at Rs 61,140-60,750, while resistance is at Rs 61,950–62,410. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research Gold and silver jumped again amid downbeat US economic data and sell-off in the dollar index. Both precious metals settled on a positive note in international markets. We expect gold to test $1858 per troy ounce and silver could test $22.40 per troy ounce levels. Gold has support at $1830-1814 per troy ounce and resistance at $1858-1870 per troy ounce while silver has support at $21.55-21.00 and resistance at $22.10-22.40 per troy ounce. At MCX, gold has support at Rs 50330-50100 and resistance at Rs 50750-50920 while silver has support at Rs 61100-60660 and resistance at Rs 61900-62500. We suggest buying gold on dips around Rs 50350 with a stop loss of Rs 50100 on a closing basis for target of Rs 50800 and silver on dips around Rs 61100 with a stop loss of Rs 60600 on a closing basis for target of Rs 62400.

13,"As Dr Reddy's rises after earnings, should you buy or sell stock?",markets," Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price rose nearly three percent in early trade on May 20 a day after the company announced its March quarter earnings. Dr Reddy's reported a 76 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 88 crore, way below analysts' expectations of Rs 677 crore, largely due to impairment of non-current assets worth Rs 751.5 crore. The company reported a 15 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated revenues from operations to Rs 5,437 crore. Dr Reddy's said that during the quarter it marked down the value of tepilamide fumarate extended release tablets by Rs 433 crore, Shreveport cash generating unit by Rs 305 crore and saw impairment of Rs 17 crore in other intangible assets. Catch all the market action on our live blog Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after March quarter earnings Credit Suisse The research house has kept a neutral rating on the stock on high market expectations from Revlimid opportunity. It has kept a target of Rs 4,465. The good launch momentum in the US will continue while concerns remain about potential litigation from payers for Revlimid generic, said Credit Suisse. The market is factoring in sustenance of low price erosion environment, CNBC-TV18 reported. Morgan Stanley The brokerage has maintained an overweight rating on the stock with a target of Rs 5,202.

""We expect 13 percent earnings per share compound annual rate over FY22-24 (excluding Revlimid) and broadly maintain our estimates at ‘Buy’ rating with revised target price of Rs 4,900. ""Delay in key ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) approvals and prolonged inflationary environment of raw material prices are key risks to our call."" Sharekhan ""Strong growth prospects across business, opportunities from vaccines exports, sturdy product pipeline, and expected growth in the portfolio in the US would likely enable the firm to tide over pricing pressures in the US and provide ample growth visibility.

14,Let the rupee depreciate,markets," The recent depreciation of the rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar – it has been striking new lows almost daily -- is being viewed with some concern at the popular level, going by the tone of media headlines.

15,Time to take stock after this week’s market volatility,markets," Nifty has been bearing the brunt of a global selloff of risky assets for several months now. In fact, barring a few days of consolidation around the middle of last month, Nifty has struggled through an almost uninterrupted correction of nearly 13% since the beginning of April.

On 17th May, this seemingly incessant fall was arrested at the previous swing low, and made way for a large recovery of nearly 3% in a single day. This, however,..."
16,Dollar falls for first week in seven amid US yield retreat,markets," The U.S. dollar headed for its worst week since early February against major peers on Friday, weighed down by a retreat in Treasury yields and fatigue after the currency’s breathless 10%, 14-week surge. The dollar index, which measures it against six major rivals, was down 1.5% for the week to 102.96, on track to snap a six-week winning run. A week earlier it had soared to the highest since January 2003 at 105.01. Even with global stocks continuing to slide amid risks to growth from aggressive monetary tightening, led by the Federal Reserve, and China’s strict lockdowns to quash a COVID-19 outbreak, the dollar’s appeal as a haven was eclipsed by a decline in U.S. yields as investors rushed for the safety of Treasury bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank overnight to a more than three-week low of 2.772%, from a 3 1/2-year high of over 3.2% earlier this month. ”The dollar was ripe for a pullback,” Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA, wrote in a note to clients. ”Across the board weakness might continue a while longer.” Other safe haven currencies continued to rally overnight, as a key index of global equities headed for a seventh weekly decline, its longest ever. The yen headed for a second-straight weekly advance, with the dollar dropping 1.16% to 127.785 yen since last Friday. The Swiss franc headed for its best week since March 2020, with the dollar falling 2.9% over the period to last trade at 0.97265 franc. Concerns grew that the Fed and other central banks have fallen behind the curve in combatting super-hot inflation, and will need to be ever more aggressive in tightening policy, inflicting pain on the economy as a consequence. The war in Ukraine shows no sign of abating either, darkening the outlook for commodity price-driven inflation. China’s path out of coronavirus lockdowns also remains unclear, threatening more global price pressures, even as Shanghai prepares to allow more businesses in zero-COVID areas to resume normal operations from the beginning of June. The Australian and New Zealand dollars have drawn some support from signs of a reopening in their major trading partner, despite the risk-off tone in equity markets. The Aussie has rallied 1.4% this week and the kiwi has added 1.49%. Australia’s currency slipped on Friday though, down 0.23% to $0.7031, as the U.S. dollar bounced a bit after the Aussie’s 1.33% surge on Thursday. ”China’s strict lockdowns are the main reason why AUD has diverged so much from the level implied by its fundamentals,” Carol Kong, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. ”We remain confident AUD can rebound strongly once lockdowns are eased because of China's commitment to ramp up infrastructure spending.” New Zealand’s kiwi though held all of the previous day’s 1.41% jump, ticking up a bit more to $0.63845. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand sets policy next Wednesday, with expectations for another half-point increase to the key rate. The euro edged 0.07% lower on Friday to $1.05735, but was still on course for a 1.55% weekly gain. Sterling slipped 0.07% to $1.24615, but was up 1.66% for the week, its best showing since late 2020. Westpac analysts warned not to count the dollar out, even if its rally was ”losing some of its vitality”.

17,"Daily Voice | Structurally bullish on defence, chemicals, API, Jitendra Gohil of Credit Suisse bets on realty, too",markets," Credit Suisse is structurally bullish on defence, chemical and the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) stocks, and believes that investors with a medium to long term horizon should start looking at real estate companies as demand growth is expected to remain solid despite rate hikes by the RBI. During an interaction with Moneycontrol, India equity research head at Credit Suisse Wealth Management, Jitendra Gohil, shares that he sees that the Indian market will remain choppy for the next few months. ""Sector rotation and bottom-up stock picking is the best strategy now,"" he says. Despite a slowing global growth and rising interest rates, oil prices have remained stubbornly high, and this is certainly a cause for concern for India, Gohil says. ""If oil prices shoot up further, say another 10-15 percent, India may see one more round of selloff. Secondly, the Indian equity market is pricing in 15 percent per annum growth for FY 2023 and FY 2024."" Excerpts from the interaction: With the fall of more than 15 percent from record highs, do you think the market has bottomed out for the time being and priced in all risk factors? There are a lot of moving parts, and it is difficult to say with conviction if this is a bottom or we can see another 5-10 percent correction or more. From valuation perspective, the Nifty index is trading at a rolling 12-month forward PE of 17.6 times versus the peak of over 22.5 times in October last year. This is also comparable versus 3- and 5-year pre-COVID average (from 2017-2019 and 2015-2019) of 17.5 and 17.0 times, respectively. Also read - Mine has been a lone voice in MPC, but I have never felt lonely: Jayanth Varma Hence, from a valuation perspective, the Index is now trading closer to a reasonable level, in our view. India's fundamentals are far superior compared to pre-COVID 3- and 5-year average. For example, BSE 500 net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) has improved materially from over three times to now close to 1.5 times, while the ROEs (return on equity) have jumped from high single digits to about 13 percent. This fundamental shift, coupled with the fastest growth in EPS (earnings per share) compared to other large economies for the next two years, makes us comfortable on valuations for Indian equities as of now. Due to these factors, we have been very vocal for the past one year that India deserves a higher PE premium compared to global peers and despite spike in commodity prices, especially oil, India's relative valuation premium remains at historically high levels. What risk factors do you see that can bring in more correction for the market? Markets can be irrational in the short-term and despite improved fundamentals of Indian corporates, we may see valuation may undershoot. During escalating geopolitical tensions, widespread fears of price hikes have resulted in hoarding of essential commodities such as food and oil globally. Over and above this, supply constraints, sanctions and stimulus-led demand has created shortages of several essential commodities. Also read - Indonesia to lift ban on palm oil exports from May 23 Despite slowing global growth and rising interest rates, oil prices have remained stubbornly high, and this is certainly concerning for India. If oil prices shoot up further, say another 10-15 percent, India may see one more round of selloff. Secondly, the Indian equity market is pricing in 15 percent per annum growth for FY 2023 and FY 2024. If the RBI goes aggressive in controlling inflation, we expect some downgrades to Nifty EPS growth expectations. We are already 2-4 percent below consensus for the next two years and we may cut our expectations if growth dwindles further. So far, we have been expecting some additional fiscal headroom for the government given robust tax collections, but given expectation of overall slowdown in GDP growth, the fiscal headroom is waning in my view. Adani Group picked up Holcim's stake in ACC and Ambuja Cements. Do you expect more consolidation in the cement space? From an industry perspective, this deal may lead to higher competition and margin pressure depending on the acquirer's strategy in the medium term with respect to expansion, pricing and target market share, in my view. Also read - 10 sectors where small-cap mutual fund managers went on a treasure hunt Indian cement companies are already trading at a substantial premium to global averages and given the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) framework is gaining traction, foreign players may decide to exit. Moreover, domestically some small players are not expanding capacities and are thus losing market share. We think that this is a good opportunity for larger players to expand via acquisitions. The deal has also capped valuations for existing players, in our view, as it was just above the current valuations, which is likely to pave the way for further consolidation in the sector. From a long-term perspective, we remain positive on the infrastructure and housing sectors in India, which creates a promising demand outlook for the cement sector, further supported by the present urbanization trend and already low per-capita cement consumption. We are near the end of March quarter earnings season. Have you seen more downgrades than upgrades due to inflation worries? Surprisingly, Corporate India is withstanding the cost pressure very well so far. There are pockets of downgrades and upgrades but net-net earnings have been resilient so far. Up to a point, inflation is positive for earnings and this view has played out, but if it goes out of control earnings can take a knock, in our view. According to our analysis, Corporate India can weather up to 7 percent CPI inflation, after which Indian equities might see deterioration in valuations. We are currently at this point, and the RBI, too, acted when retail inflation started to rise above 7 percent, which re-confirms our thesis. Going forward, normal monsoon, salary hikes and private capex growth will determine the earnings trajectory for India, and it seems that we are on track so far. On the positive side, slower growth will impact commodity prices as well and some of the companies that are facing unprecedented commodity cost inflation may see margin tailwind in the next 12 months, once the inflation starts to fall. Hence we have started recommending FMCG and some consumption oriented names. On the basis of March quarter earnings and macro risks, what are your broad earnings expectations for the first quarter of FY 2023 and full year as well? We are below consensus by about 4 percent for the next two years. After recent broad-based correction, where do you see the value that can be picked for portfolio? We have been expecting the Indian equity market to remain choppy for the next few months, and think sector rotation and bottom-up stock picking is the best strategy. We have advised our investors to exit or book profits in the IT sector few months ago, while we have started to become constructive on the FMCG sector where a lot of negatives are already priced in. We also like selected discretionary companies now, including autos where we think supply constraints will abate and cost pressures will come down in the next few quarters. We are structurally bullish on defence, chemical and the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) sectors. We recommended investors to book profits in the real estate sector few months ago, but in this correction medium- to long-term investors should start looking at real estate companies as demand growth is expected to remain solid despite rate hikes by the RBI, in our view. Lastly, some of the reopening plays such as multiplexes and staffing companies look attractive from a medium- to long-term perspective. Do you expect inflation concerns to stay for long and is there any further major cut in global growth forecast for FY 2023? Yes, inflation could remain elevated in India and globally for some more time, partly due to rising import bills and supply constraints globally. Until geopolitical tensions are fully abated, it will be difficult to say convincingly when inflation will come under control. However, the base effect will catch up and slowdown in economic activities will hopefully bring down inflation in the latter part of the year, in our view. In terms of global growth, we always have been cautious as in my view this isn't a 2003-07 like scenario where the recovery was broad-based across the globe and despite the Federal Reserve hiking rates, the US dollar was falling. Post-pandemic recovery is fragile and uneven across the globe and within India as well. This time, Fed tightening is leading to strengthening of the USD, which is putting tremendous pressure on emerging economies like India that are import-dependent. The consensus expectation of global growth is 3.3 percent, down from 4.4 percent at the beginning of the year. China, too, is slowing down materially as its key growth engine, real estate, is struggling. Surging inflation is forcing central banks to tighten policies faster, which may not immediately bring down inflation, which is supply led, while higher interest cost may derail economic growth for many countries. In this challenging environment, India's position so far has been relatively better and our growth slowdown is much slower than other countries. On the flip side, if growth starts to dwindle dramatically, global central banks including India may have to go slow on hiking interest rates, but this isn’t our central scenario. Our House View is that growth will remain reasonably strong to withstand higher interest rates by the Fed.

18,Asian shares jump as China cuts key lending benchmark,markets," Asian shares jumped in early trade on Friday after China cut a key lending benchmark to support a slowing economy, but a gauge of global equities remained set for its longest weekly losing streak on record amid investor worries about sluggish growth. China cut its five-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 15 basis points on Friday morning, a sharper cut than had been expected, as authorities seek to cushion an economic slowdown, though it left the one-year LPR unchanged. The five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. Most respondents to a Reuters poll had expected a marginal 5-basis-point cut to both rates. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan quickly built on early gains after the cut, and was last up 1.4 percent. Chinese blue-chips were 1.1 percent higher in early trade and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped more than 2 percent, while Australian shares rose 1.3 percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index gained 1 percent. ”While it certainly will not suffice to reverse growth headwinds in Q2, (the cut) constitutes a move in the right direction so markets might be reacting to expectations of stronger easing going forward,” said Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at Union Bancaire Privee in Hong Kong. Despite the gains in Asian shares, MSCI’s All-Country World Price Index remained headed for its seventh straight week in the red, the longest such stretch since its inception in 2001. It would also be the longest including back-tested data extending to January 1988. Concerns over the impact of battered supply chains on inflation and growth have prompted investors to dump shares, with Cisco Systems Inc on Thursday tumbling to an 18-month low after it warned of persistent component shortages, citing the impact of China’s COVID lockdowns. On Friday, China’s financial hub of Shanghai announced three new COVID-19 cases outside of quarantined areas, throwing a wrench in the city’s hopes for an exit from its strict, weeks-long lockdown. ”The focus of (Chinese) officials has been to come up with easing policies to mitigate the impact of COVID suppression … The problem is that such easing policies will not have any real impact so long as the COVID suppression policy is tightly enforced,” said Christopher Wood, global head of equities at Jefferies. The gains in Asia came after a late rally on Wall Street petered out, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.75 percent, the S&P 500 0.58 percent lower and the Nasdaq Composite off by 0.26 percent. Mirroring the shift in risk appetite in equities, U.S. government bond yields ticked higher following China’s LPR cut. The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.8677 percent, up from a close of 2.855 percent on Thursday, while the two-year yield climbed to 2.6364 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.611 percent. In currency markets, the dollar index was 0.08 percent higher at 102.99 as the safe-haven yen slipped against the dollar. The greenback was last up 0.23 percent against the Japanese currency, and the euro was 0.14 percent lower at $1.0571. China’s onshore yuan weakened a quarter of a percent to 6.726 per dollar, and the more freely traded offshore yuan weakened past 6.74 per dollar. Oil prices remained lower on worries over economic growth, through crude pared losses following China’s LPR announcement. Brent crude was last down 0.37 percent at to $111.63 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was 0.19 percent lower at $112 per barrel.

20,"Fed to plow ahead on half-point hikes, undeterred by stock slump",markets," Don’t count on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to ride to the rescue of a faltering stock market -- at least not yet. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said Thursday that the market rout was no surprise in light of the central bank’s repeated caution that it will continue raising interest rates to cool the hottest inflation in decades. While she acknowledged equities were having a “rough” week, her remarks in a CNBC interview did nothing to soften the tone set by Powell on Tuesday, who warned that officials seek “clear and convincing” evidence that price pressures are retreating. That’s not encouraging for investors betting on the imminent exercise of a “Fed put” -- in which the central bank alters policy to prop up equity markets after a sharp decline.  The Fed raised interest rates by 50 basis points earlier this month and Powell indicated it was on track to make similar-sized moves at its meetings in June and July, as well as start reducing the central bank’s bloated balance sheet. But in the months ahead, signs of a slowing economy and reduced price pressures would set the stage for a debate at the Federal Open Market Committee’s September 20-21 meeting on easing back to quarter-point hikes. “The tightening in financial conditions is an intended consequence of Fed hikes and QT,” or quantitative tightening, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “They want to slow down aggregate demand and financial conditions need to tighten to do that.” The S&P 500 suffered its worst selloff since June 2020 on Wednesday as investors assessed the impact of higher prices on earnings, following disappointments by retailers  Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., as well as what monetary-policy tightening means for economic growth. This week’s slide extended the year-to-date decline to about 18%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down 27%. While his remarks were before the latest slide, Powell didn’t sound perturbed by the weakness seen since January. “I think the Fed welcomes it. The stock market has to decline a lot more -- double the current drop -- before it will get close to wiping out the stock gains during the pandemic. This sounds callous, but declining stocks will get more people to come out of early retirement.” --Anna Wong, chief U.S. economist Falling equities assist the Fed’s goal of slowing growth because of the “wealth effect” in which investors curtail some spending in response to market drops. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists have cut their US economic forecasts for this year and next, citing in part the decline in stocks. Each $1 of lost financial wealth translates into a drop of spending of two to three cents over the course of a year, they estimated. “What we have seen so far remains consistent with the Fed’s objectives in terms of tightening financial conditions to slow growth and realign demand with depressed supply,” said Robert Dent, a Nomura Securities economist. “The market is beginning to come to terms with a Fed that is determined to bring inflation lower at all costs.”  The stock market isn’t the only goal of Fed tightening. Higher rates for home mortgages and vehicles reduces demand in those markets, where supplies have been short, and a stronger dollar has the effect of cutting export demand for US manufacturers and trimming import prices. Even so, there are limits to how far stocks could fall before the Fed might pay attention. While most of the declines this year have been a revaluation of equities and future earnings based on expected higher interest rates, a decrease that seemed to signal a sharper downturn in the economy than desired would be concerning. “The Fed may well welcome a tightening in financial conditions, but they are walking a very fine line,” said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Piper Sandler. “If S&P 500 earnings estimates as a whole start dropping, the Fed would most likely pay attention. It would be a sign that the economy is faltering and that a soft landing looks even less likely.” Fed leaders have taken a lesson from recessions of the past two decades that declines in equities are usually not too consequential, while any disruptions in credit markets -- such as the subprime mortgage blowup that lead to the 2007-2009 recession -- can be extremely damaging. The 2000 technology-stock plunge when the dot.com bubble burst has been seen by central bankers as mostly benign for the economy.  “What matters to the Fed is a credit market seizure,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “That is not easy to recover from and is something to be guarded against. A Fed-induced slowdown is much easier to recover from.” What volatility has occurred has been just markets digesting information, New York Fed President John Williams said this week, adding he supports the Powell plan to raise rates. Most Fed officials have embraced raising rates to a neutral setting --  which neither speeds up nor slows down the economy -- this year. The FOMC estimated that at 2.4% in quarterly forecasts updated in March. Powell and other Fed officials have said they are willing to go well past that level if necessary to cool prices, though the pace of increases could slow. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans laid out a plan in a Bloomberg News interview this week in which policy makers would raise rates to neutral quickly, then switch to “a more measured pace” of quarter-point hikes to end up 50 or 75 basis points above neutral. While the near-term policy outlook is unchanged, market turmoil and any indications of slower growth could set the stage for a policy shift from “peak Fed hawkishness,” said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management.

21,"SEBI comes out with new format for security cover certificate, revises timeline",markets," With an aim to provide a holistic picture of all borrowings and the status of encumbrance on the assets of listed entities, capital markets regulator SEBI on Thursday came out with a new format for disclosing security cover to stock exchange and debenture trustee. Also, the regulator has put in place obligations of listed entity and debenture trustee (DT) with respect to preparation and submission of security cover format, according to a circular. It has specified the manner of preparation of security cover certificate by listed entity and DT. In addition, SEBI has revised timelines of submission of security cover certificate, valuation report and quarterly compliance report, and regulatory compliance by debenture trustees. This comes after representations were received from issuers, debenture trustee(s) as well as other market participants on issues related to operational challenges faced in complying with certain provisions of circulars and have also given suggestions on strengthening such requirements. These challenges were also discussed in the SEBI-constituted Working Group on ""Unique Identification Code – Securities & Covenant Monitoring System"". After taking into account recommendations of the Working Group and feedback from market participants, the regulator last month amended the Debenture Trustees rules, LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) norms and SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations. Further, ""based on the recommendation of the Working Group, the security cover format has been revised…The revised format has been prepared to provide a holistic picture of all the borrowings and the status of encumbrance on the assets of the listed entity,” the regulator said. SEBI said that a listed entity will be required to prepare the security cover certificate on quarterly basis, and the statutory auditor of the listed entity will certify the book values of the assets provided in such certificate. Also, debenture trustee on quarterly basis is required to certify the market value of assets based on the due diligence carried out by it or its appointed agencies and submit the security cover certificate in a specified format. The regulator has standardised the calculation of security cover ratios. The certificates certified by the statutory auditor of issuer company and by the empanelled independent CAs of the debenture trustee will have the Unique Document Identification Number (UDIN) generated in the manner prescribed by the relevant regulatory authority. The DT will have to ensure that the qualifications/disclaimer (by whatever name called), does not impair the rights of debenture holders in terms of security provided. Further, if the DT is of opinion that such qualifications/disclaimer are affecting rights of debenture holders, the DT will be required to take corrective action in this regard. With regard to monitoring of covenants, SEBI said that on quarterly basis, listed entity will have to furnish the compliance status with respect to financial covenants of the listed debt securities certified by statutory auditor of listed entity to debenture trustee. In order to ensure effective monitoring, debenture trustee is required to establish board-approved internal policies with respect to proactive and effective monitoring of breach of covenants and such policy. In order to enhance transparency with respect to no-objection certificate (NOC)/no-dues certificate issued by DT and monitoring of listed entity, Debenture Trustee will have to make certain disclosure to stock exchanges, including any breach of the minimum security cover within 48 hours of such breach. In respect to timelines, SEBI said that the DT will have to submit security cover certificate to the stock exchange and make website disclosure of the security cover certificate and quarterly compliance report within 75 days from the end of each quarter except the last quarter of financial year. In addition, the DT will be required to submit the security cover certificate to the exchange and make website disclosure of the security cover certificate and quarterly compliance report for the last quarter of the financial year within 90 days from the end of the financial year, and the valuation report and title search report to the exchange once in three years within 75 days from the end of the financial year. On independent verification of creation of Recovery Expense Fund (REF) by issuer companies, Debenture Trustee(s) will be required to take confirmation from designated stock exchange(s) or any other independent source in writing regarding the creation of REF by the listed entity and will not rely solely upon the communication by the listed entity. The exchange(s) will be required to disclose the REFs created by the listed entities on half-yearly basis. Such disclosure will also include the details of the debenture trustee to the debt issue. The framework related to revised format of the security cover and monitoring of covenants’ are applicable with effect from October 1.

0,Wall St sell-off deepens on Snap's bleak forecast; Nasdaq tumbles over 3%,markets," Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the slump, as a weak earnings forecast from Snapchat-owner Snap Inc added to nerves about an inflation-struck economy. Snap Inc plummeted 39.7%, dragging down several social media and internet stocks, after the company slashed its second-quarter earnings forecast and said the economy had worsened faster than expected in the last month. The stock was set for its worst single-day drop. Twitter Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Pinterest Inc, which rely heavily on advertising revenue, fell between 3.0% and 24.8%. ""Snap is a proxy for online advertising and when you see weakness there then you automatically think Facebook, Pinterest and Google,"" Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, said. ""The back half of the earnings season has seen major disappointments. Expectations are a lot lower, but these companies seem to be finding a way to even get under the lower bar."" Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors declined in morning trade after rising broadly in the previous session. The communication services sector slid 5.2%. Wall Street rebounded on Monday from a steep selloff last week that saw both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq mark their longest streak of weekly declines since the dotcom bust in 2001 on mounting concerns about a recession. Data showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in May as higher prices cooled demand for services, while renewed supply constraints because of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine hampered production at factories. ""Yesterday's rally and Friday's action suggested that the market hit a near-term bottom, but there's still a lot of negative sentiment ... (macro worries) are a big part of this decline,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day, with investors looking for fresh comments about the path of future interest rate hikes. Markets are pricing in 50 basis point rate hikes by the Fed in June and July. . At 10:06 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 246.25 points, or 0.77%, at 31,633.99, the S&P 500 was down 70.15 points, or 1.77%, at 3,903.60, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 376.45 points, or 3.26%, at 11,158.83. Abercrombie & Fitch Co slumped 27.2% after the apparel retailer trimmed its annual sales and margins outlook, citing a surge in freight and raw material costs. Zoom Video Communications Inc inched up 0.9% after raising its full-year profit forecast on strong enterprise demand. The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 29.24 points. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 4.46-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

1,"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | RBI lays its cards on the table, over to the market now",markets," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das’s comment that expectations of a rate hike in the upcoming policy meetings are a “no-brainer” has hardly been a surprise for investors. The benchmark Nifty 50 index was little changed on Monday and in Tuesday afternoon trade. The RBI, like several other central banks, has waited too long to tame inflation and is now rushing to withdraw the COVID stimulus. The minutes of the unscheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held in May showed unanimity that rate hikes are needed to tame inflation. This has prepared market participants for more rate hikes, reducing the so-called shock factor, even though the inflation trajectory remains a key variable. ""If further aggressive (stronger) rate hikes do not materialise, then it will be a positive surprise for equities, while meeting expectations of aggressive rate hikes will keep equity valuations subdued although the shock and awe situation will recede,” ICICI Securities said in a note. The government too has woken up to the inflation threat and has initiated duty cuts to tame prices. It is reportedly considering more measures to contain prices of essential goods. Still, duty changes will help only to a certain extent. The current global inflation is stoked by a combination of events such as the Ukraine war, continued disruptions in the global supply chains and the unprecedented COVID stimulus. These headwinds may not ease immediately. “Higher-for-longer inflation will keep interest rates elevated and act as a headwind to market multiples,” warns Kotak Institutional Equities Research. Talking about expectations, investors have sent shares of Divi’s Laboratories lower after the March quarter results. The headline numbers are strong. However, analysts fear Divi’s may not be able to maintain performance as COVID drug-related sales which have powered the company’s earnings in FY22 may abate in the current fiscal FY23. In primary markets, the initial public offering (IPO) of speciality chemicals manufacturer Aether Industries has opened for subscription. The company enjoys a sizeable market share in its key products, giving it a competitive advantage. However, valuations leave a limited margin of safety, warns Anubhav Sahu. Read his analysis here.

2,SEBI issues Rs 3.12-crore demand notice to NSE's ex-boss Chitra Ramkrishna,markets," Capital markets regulator SEBI on Tuesday sent a notice to NSE’s former chief Chitra Ramkrishna asking her to pay Rs 3.12 crore in a case related to governance lapses at the stock exchange, and warned of arrest and attachment of assets and bank accounts if she fails to make the payment within 15 days. The notice came after Ramkrishna failed to pay the fine imposed on her by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In an order dated February 11, SEBI had slapped a penalty of Rs 3 crore on Ramkrishna for alleged governance lapses in a case related to the appointment of Anand Subramanian as the Group Operating Officer and Advisor when she was at the helm of NSE as its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, as well as for sharing confidential information of the company with an unidentified person. Apart from penalising Ramkrishna, SEBI had imposed a penalty on Ravi Narain, who was the predecessor of Ramkrishna, and Subramanian and others. In its fresh notice, SEBI directed Ramkrishna to pay Rs 3.12 crore, which includes interest and recovery cost, within 15 days. In the event of non-payment of dues, the markets regulator will recover the amount by attaching and selling her moveable and immoveable property. Besides, Ramkrishna faces attachment of her bank accounts and arrest. Ramkrishna is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail after she was arrested by the CBI on March 6 in the NSE co-location scam case and investigation linked to other governance lapses at the bourse. Last month, the regulator issued similar demand notices to Narain and Subramanian. In April, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) admitted Ramkrishna’s plea against the SEBI order in relation to governance lapses at the bourse and directed her to deposit an amount of Rs 2 crore.

Contrary to this, strength shall be expected only at a close above 16,400 levels,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Founder & Chief Market Strategist, Chartviewindia.in, said. It will be prudent on the behalf of market participants to remain neutral on the Nifty till a decisive move in either direction, he said.

4,Taking Stock | Market erases early gains to end lower after yet another volatile session,markets," The Indian equity benchmark erased the day’s gains to ended lower in yet another volatile session on May 24, amid mixed global cues and selling across sectors. At close, the Sensex was down 236 points, or 0.43 percent, at 54,052.61, and the Nifty was down 89.50 points, or 0.55 percent, at 16,125.20. The market opened flat with a positive bias but swung between gains and losses throughout the session, closing near the day's low. The Sensex traded in the range of 54,524.37-53,886.28, while the Nifty moved in the 16,262.80-16,078.60 range. ""Anxiety of slowing economy and rising interest rates underpinned by soaring inflation continued to haunt the global market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. The UK and Eurozone composite PMI registered the slowest rise in business activity in May, worsening global investor risk sentiment, he said. On the domestic front, while all major sectors succumbed to the pressure, the auto sector bucked the trend, gaining on fuel-price cut and rise in steel custom duty, he added. Dr Reddy’s Labs, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Nestle India and HDFC Bank were among the top Nifty gainers, while losers included Divi’s Labs, Tech Mahindra, Grasim Industries, Hindalco Industries and HUL. Among sectors, Nifty IT, pharma, metal, FMCG shed a percent each, while the energy index fell 0.87 percent. Stocks and sectors On the BSE, information technology, healthcare, metal, FMCG, power and realty indices were down a percent each. The bank index, however, gained marginally. Broader indices underperformed the benchmarks, with the BSE midcap index falling 0.85 percent and smallcap index down 1.1 percent. A long build-up was seen in Coromandel International, Ashok Leyland and Abbott India, while a short build-up was witnessed in PVR, Divi’s Laboratories and Balrampur Chini Mills. Amara Raja Batteries, CSB Bank, Divi's Laboratories, Equitas Small Finance Bank, D. Lal PathLabs, HDFC Asset Management Company and Tata Steel were among the stocks that touched their 52-week low on the BSE. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 300 percent was seen in Punjab National Bank, Balrampur Chini Mills and BHEL. Outlook for May 25 Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities The cautious optimism seen in early trade failed to generate healthy gains as weakness in Asian peers and pessimism in European gauges triggered last-hour selling. Investors are waiting for the minutes of the US FOMC meeting, which will offer cues on the central bank's rate-hike direction. There is a lot of skepticism among investors about interest rate hikes in the near term and their impact on growth. On the daily chart, the Nifty has formed a bearish candle, which indicates further weakness. As long as the index trades below 16,250, the correction wave is likely to continue. A slip could see the index retest 16,000-15,050. On the flip side, post-16,250 breakout, the index could move to 16,325-16,375. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The Nifty remained directionless during the day leading to volatility in the market. On the higher end, resistance will be at 16,400 over the near term. Support on the lower end remains at 16,000-16,020. Volatility may continue over the near term. Any decisive breakout above 16,400 may induce a strong directional move in the market. Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Markets traded volatile and lost over half a percent in line with the prevailing consolidation phase. After the flat start, the benchmark hovered in a range for most of the session and settled closer to the day’s low. A mixed trend across sectors kept the participants busy, wherein IT, metal and realty were among the top losers. The broader markets underperformed as both midcap and smallcap ended 0.9 percent and 1 percent lower. Indications favour further consolidation, so participants should have a stock-specific trading approach. In the absence of any major events, global cues, earnings and upcoming derivatives expiry will be in focus.

5,Rupee slips 4 paise to close at 77.59 against US dollar,markets," The rupee slipped by 4 paise to close at 77.59 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday, weighed down by a negative trend in domestic equities and unabated foreign fund outflows. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened lower at 77.56 against the greenback, and finally settled at 77.59, down 4 paise over its previous close. During the trading session, the rupee touched an intra-day low of 77.67 and a high of 77.51. On Monday, the rupee recovered from record lows and settled 15 paise higher at 77.55 against the US currency. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.07 per cent lower at 102. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.37 per cent to USD 113 per barrel. ""The Indian rupee drifted lower after two days of consolidation on the back of the risk-averse sentiment and foreign fund outflows. The rupee has been underperforming among Asian currencies amid a weaker macro environment and foreign fund outflows,” said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. While the dollar index has fallen further to the downside and eying the psychological level of 100, the local unit is weakening along with other emerging market currencies on growth and inflation worries. ""So far this month, the rupee has been the worst-performing currency among Asian currencies with a loss of 1.6 per cent after the RBI joined the global central banks in raising interest rates to curb inflation,” Parmar said. In the current calendar year, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth USD 21.25 billion and USD 1.82 billion of debt. Near-term outlook for USDINR remains bullish as long as it trades above 76.70, while on the higher side it faces strong resistance in the area of 77.80 to 78, Parmar noted. The 30-share BSE Sensex ended 236 points or 0.43 per cent lower at 54,052.61, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 89.55 points or 0.55 per cent to 16,125.15.

The firm said it has launched a new saree brand Navyasa Created by Liva, a significant opportunity to increase VSF share in a 10 lakh ton saree fibre market. Grasim said its chemical operations reported a stellar performance despite mounting cost pressure (Power and other costs), driven by sequential improvement in the electrochemical unit (ECU). The firm also said its Panipat and Ludhiana paint operations capacity expansion is expected to start shortly and the remaining three plants are in the process of getting government approval. ""We have accelerated the execution of our paint’s capacity of 1,332 MLPA with commissioning of plants to start by Q4FY24. The project cost is likely to be Rs 10,000 crore by FY25"", the firm said.

7,Aether Industries IPO is open: Should you subscribe?,markets," Aether Industries, a manufacturer of speciality chemicals, opened its initial public offer on May 24. The company makes advanced intermediates and speciality chemicals involving complex and differentiated chemistry and technical core competencies. In 2020, Aether Industries was the biggest manufacturer globally of 4-(2-Methoxyethyl) Phenol (4MEP), a key intermediate in the production of Metoprolol, used for hypertension, the company said in its prospectus. It is the sole Indian manufacturer of seven products including 4MEP that were previously imported from China, Aether said, citing a Frost & Sullivan research report. Aether, based in Surat, is one of the fastest-growing specialty chemical companies in India. It is known to have strong market positioning in complex intermediates, where global competition is intense. The average selling price of all its products was Rs 1,440.85 a kg in FY21. The focus on developing high-value products has resulted in the average selling price of all its products increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.8 percent from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2021. Features of the offer The Rs 808-crore IPO consists of a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 627 crore and an offer for sale of 2.8 million shares aggregating up to Rs 181 crore by shareholders and promoters. The offer closes on May 26. The price band has been set at Rs 610-642 for each equity share with a face value of Rs 10. Half of the net offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 35 percent for retail investors, and the remaining 15 percent for non-institutional investors. The minimum lot size is 23 shares and multiples thereof. After the issue, the promoter shareholding will decline to 61.65 percent from 81.01 percent. Brokerage recommendations Brokerages are confident about the company’s prospects, given its inherent strengths and the likely growth of the Indian chemical industry. They have rated the issue a “subscribe” or “subscribe with caution.” “Aether Industries is expected to continue to maintain its leadership position in a few of its products due to continuous focus on R&D, enhanced capacity post-expansion plans (from 6,096 million tonnes per annum to 6,500 mtpa), synergistic business models, differentiated product portfolios of market-leading products and long-standing relationships with a diversified customer base,” Anand Rathi Research said in a report. At the upper end of the price band, Aether Industries is valued at 72.3 times annualised FY22 earnings, which looks fair, considering the growth opportunities for speciality chemicals in pharma, agrochemicals and FMCG and improving prospects for contractual manufacturing, Anand Rathi said while recommending a ""subscribe-for-long-term"" rating for this IPO. According to Choice Broking, the company faces risks from unfavourable government policies and regulations, unfavourable sales-mix, and forex movements. Any adverse movement in prices of key raw materials and crude oil and delays in capacity expansion pose a risk to the company’s business, apart from the competition it faces. “At a higher price band of Rs 642, Aether is demanding an EV/sales multiple of 13.1x, which is in-line to peer average of 15.2x,” Choice Broking said in a report. Buoyant outlook Considering its dominant position in select specialty chemicals and its growth prospects from end-use applications, the company has a buoyant outlook. “However, a stretched valuation is a concern, thus we assign a ‘subscribe with caution’ rating for the issue,” Choice said. Marwadi Financial Services assigned a “subscribe with caution” rating to the IPO as “the company has low and declining operating cashflow to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which keeps us cautious from a long-term perspective.” According to Marwadi Financial Services, the company has high exposure to the pharmaceutical industry, which contributed 62.60 percent and 67.62 percent of gross revenue for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021, and FY21, respectively. A drop in demand from the pharma sector can have a big impact on the company. “At the IPO price of Rs 642, Aether is valued at 32.2x FY24 P/E,” Ventura Securities said in a report. Considering the growth opportunities for speciality chemicals in pharma, agrochemicals and the FMCG space, and improving prospects for contractual manufacturing, it recommends a “subscribe” rating with a price target of Rs 797, which represents an upside of 24 percent over the IPO price in 18 months.

The company is likely to report a near 63 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 2,100 crores for the reporting quarter, according to analysts polled by Moneycontrol. The strong growth in bottomline is likely to be aided by a 29.6 percent year-on-year rise in revenue from operations to Rs 4,700 crore for the quarter. “We model flattish YoY print on volumes on a comparable basis based on monthly updates shared by ADSEZ. On a sequential basis, this would imply 2-3 million tonnes of boost to coal volumes on a QoQ basis,” said brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities. Kotak Equities expects a 32 percent on-year growth in net profit of the Adani Group company on sales growth of more than 16 percent. The ports company is set to see a strong operating performance in the quarter as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are likely to rise nearly 42 percent on-year to Rs 3,300 crore in the reporting quarter. Kotak Equities expects the operating margin to expand 221 basis points on-year to 65.6 percent aided by stable operating environment for the company.

9,"Grasim Industries Q4 Preview | Profit may remain flat with 1-4% growth, revenue may rise 42-45%",markets," Grasim Industries Limited (Grasim), is likely to report a marginal year-on-year growth of 1-4 percent in its standalone net profit when it will declare its results later in the day on May 24 for the quarter ended March 2022. The company is, however, expected to record a 42-45 percent year-on-year growth in its standalone revenues for the quarter. The poor show on the bootmline is because of a steep surge in input prices and power and fuel costs. Brokerages expect the Aditya Birla Group company to record a PAT of Rs 500 crore for the reported quarter, while revenues are expected to increase to Rs 6,235 crore. The company had registered a PAT of Rs 463 crore during the corresponding quarter last year when it had reported revenues of Rs 4,394 crore. For the previous quarter ended December 2021, the PAT for the company came in at Rs 489 crore on revenues of Rs 5,785 crore. Brokerage Views Experts expect the growth in revenues to be driven by increase in volumes of VSF (Viscose Staple Fiber) backed by higher realisations for VSF and caustic soda. However, the rise in input costs during the quarter are likely to impact the margins, resulting in lower profitability. The brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expect the revenue for the quarter to increase by 46 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,398 crore. “We expect revenue for the VSF/chemical segment to grow by 26 percent / 90 percent on a 15 percent / 85 percent YoY growth in realisation,” a report from Motilal Oswal said. Apart from the growth in realisations, experts also forecast an on-year growth in volumes of its VSF and chemicals business. “We model a 5 percent YoY volume increase in VSF operations (a decline of 2 percent QoQ) to 165,900 tonnes and a 5 percent YoY volume increase in the chemical operations (an increase of 0.5 percent QoQ) to 280,300 tonnes on improved demand after the easing of Covid-related restrictions and improved export demand,” a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. The operating margins are likely to be impacted by the rising costs and may decline by 4.3 percent on-year. “We estimate VSF EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of Rs 370 crore (a decline of 40 percent YoY and a sequential decline of 7 percent) on higher costs, and chemicals EBITDA of Rs 480 crore (an on-year increase of 163 percent and sequential decline of 8 percent), impacted by higher costs,” a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. Motilal Oswal has similar estimates as it expects the VSF EBITDA to decline 45 percent on-year and EBITDA for the chemical segment to rise by 3.1x. It expects a per-kilo EBITDA of Rs 17 for VSF versus Rs 37 in the same period a year ago. The margin for the chemical segment is expected to improve by 7.8 percent YoY, but down 2.2 percent QoQ. Broker Estimates Motilal Oswal forecasts the revenue to increase 45.6 percent on-year to Rs 6,399 crore, while generating a PAT of Rs 469 crore. It expects the EBITDA margin to decline 4.3 percent on-year and net margins to contract 3.8 percent on-year. ICICI Securities pegs the revenue at Rs 6,406 crore with a year-on-year growth of 45.8 percent, while PAT is to grow 3.8 percent on-year to Rs 505 crore. It expects the EBITDA margin to decline 4.4 percent on-year and net margins to contract by 3.2 percent year-on-year. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates the revenue of Rs 6,227 crore registering an on-year growth of 42 percent. It forecasts the PAT to grow 7.7 percent on-year to Rs 524 crore. EBITDA margins are likely to shrink 383 bps on-year and 131 bps sequentially. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "

11,"Rupa shares post record 20% slide on confusion over CEO, CFO resignation",markets," Shares of undergarment maker Rupa & Co sank nearly 20 percent on May 24, the biggest one-day fall on record, following a weak earnings print for the quarter ended March and a sudden reshuffle in the company’s top management. The company reported a 25 percent year-on-year decline in its net profit to Rs 49 crore for the quarter ended March as higher costs weighed on the company’s performance. Sales in the quarter were flat compared to the year-ago quarter even as the management said that volumes declined around 10 percent. Investors were spooked by the sudden resignation of Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Kumar Lodha and Chief Financial Officer Ramesh Agarwal on May 23 when the company announced its results. However, the company later clarified that the CEO has resigned for “personal reasons” and will continue to be part of the selection process of the new chief executive of the company. “The Board of Directors has accepted the said resignation and decided to relieve Mr Dinesh Kumar of his responsibilities from 31 May 2022,” the company said in an exchange filing. Rupa & Company also said that the CFO of the company, who is also part of the promoter group, has resigned to free up time from day-to-day management of the company and “leverage his rich experience in overall growth and transformation of the company”. The company said that Agarwal will continue to guide the company as a whole-time director. In Agarwal’s stead, the company has promoted Sumit Khowala as the chief financial officer, who has spent over a decade at the company. “I think some people need to learn the difference in a person leaving a company and continuing as a director on the board. Anyways each to his own. That’s how, as per me, opportunities arise in extreme reactions,” said famed individual investor Safir Anand on twitter, who said he has bought more shares of the company today.

15,"Oil prices inch lower on concerns over recession, China COVID curbs",markets," Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns over a possible recession and China's COVID-19 curbs outweighed an expectation of tight global supply and a pick-up in fuel demand with the U.S. summer driving season. Brent crude futures for July slid 61 cents, or 0.5%, to $112.81 a barrel by 0402 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for July delivery dropped 55 cents, or 0.5%, to $109.74 a barrel. Both benchmarks fell by more than $1 earlier in the session. Brent gained 0.7% on Monday while WTI settled nearly flat. Multiple threats to the global economy topped the worries ofthe world's well-heeled at the annual Davos economic summit,with some flagging the risk of a worldwide recession. International Monetary Fund Managing Director KristalinaGeorgieva said she did not expect a recession for majoreconomies but could not rule one out. ""Investors were selling off as they expected higher oil prices to dent consumption for fuels worldwide,"" said Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities Co Ltd. While Shanghai, China's commercial hub, aims to normalise life from June 1 as its coronavirus caseloads decline, an increase in new COVID-19 cases in Beijing have raised concerns for further curbs. The Chinese capital detected 99 new cases on Sunday, up from 61 the previous day - the largest daily tally so far during a month-old outbreak that has consistently seen dozens of new infections every day. ""China's COVID lockdowns are certainly playing a substantial role that weighs on fuel and energy demand outlook, with Beijing reporting rising positive cases, making investors concerned about expanding lockdowns into another business hub apart from Shanghai,"" said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets.

16,"Daily Voice | Sensex, Nifty unlikely to set new record highs in near term, says GIC Re CIO Radhika Ravishekar",markets," The markets still haven’t fully discounted rising US interest rates, inflation risks, outcomes of geopolitical tensions and commodity and crude oil prices, Radhika Ravishekar, chief investment officer at General Insurance Corporation of India, said in an interview to Moneycontrol. She ruled out the possibility of indices setting record highs soon, saying volatility is expected to continue. Even in the case of a recovery, there will be some selling on every rise until conditions stabilise, said Ravishekar. Edited excerpts: Since October, the market has rebounded twice to move above 18,000 on the Nifty 50 and 60,000 on the Sensex. If the market recovers this time, will the benchmark indices go beyond old record high levels? Geopolitical tensions, rising inflation, tightening of liquidity and Covid-19 disruptions in China have raised market volatility across asset classes and accelerated the risk-off sentiment. Volatility is expected to continue. Even in the case of recovery, for the indices to go beyond the old record high levels would be a far reality as markets would witness some selling on every rise till the conditions stabilise. Easing of currently volatile crude prices, turnaround in FII flows, and bottoming of the rupee could give the Nifty some momentum, but underlying global inflation risks resulting in faster-than-anticipated rate hikes are the key downside risk. What pockets look attractive to buy now, especially after the significant correction in the last one-and-half-months? We are seeing a lot of sectoral churning. Leaders of the last two years – IT, pharma, metals and mining – have given up their leadership positions and are passing the same to sectors like oil & gas, finance, automobiles. Quality private banks have done very well and are available at good discounts compared to their yearly highs. The most neglected sector is auto. Two-wheelers will witness a smoother transition compared to four-wheelers as they are trading at attractive valuations. Cement (due to higher infrastructure spending and the ability to pass on increased raw material costs) and defence stocks can be looked into. Defence stocks will witness import substitution along with PLI (production-linked incentives) unleashing a good amount of exports. Will the Reserve Bank of India cut the growth forecast further in the June policy meeting if inflation concerns persist? The RBI in February 2022 cut the growth forecast from 7.8 percent to 7.2 percent. Many rating agencies have reduced the growth forecast for India and so it is expected that the RBI may cut the growth forecast. Will the RBI be more hawkish if the inflation risk persists? The RBI will raise the inflation projection and is not in denial mode to consider more interest rate hikes… the RBI may come up with another two to three 50 basis point increases in repo rates in the next six to eight months. FMCG is the least affected sector in the past one-and-half-months despite inflation worries. Is it time to go overboard on this sector? FMCG stocks have been under pressure in the recent market selloff due to concerns over inflation leading to margin pressures and weak demand… The market is anticipating a scenario of stagflation, which will limit the upside in FMCG stocks. As FMCG stocks may witness healthy growth in the long term, investment is to be made with a three-year horizon. What are the risk factors yet to be discounted by the market? The rise in interest rates in the US, inflation risks, further outcomes of geo-political tensions and commodity and crude prices are still not very much discounted by the markets. Any further adverse news may give some shock to the markets. Metal and realty are the most affected sectors in the last one-and-half-months. Is it time to accumulate them or should one stay away from them? There is still good momentum in metal stocks, with stable earnings for the last couple of quarters. With ‘Make in India’ and other government initiatives, metal companies have the ability to sustain growth and profitability. After the easing of the pandemic, there is good growth in infra projects and the housing sector. Increased infra spending by the government and high demand from consumers in the housing sector give an indication of good growth in this sector. To conclude, one should be overweight in quality large-caps within whichever sector one chooses as the damage would be the least.

0,Divi's Lab declines 5% amid concern over 'unsustainable' growth  ,markets," Divi's Laboratories Ltd fell nearly 5 percent to hit near 13-month low on Tuesday, despite a robust performance after analysts warned that the abnormal growth looks unsustainable as the pandemic eased globally. The stock hit a low of Rs 3,676.85 a share on the BSE -- a level lase seen on 5 April 2021 and fell as much as 5 percent from its previous close. At 9.40am, the scrip was trading at Rs 3725 on BSE, down 4.42 percent from its previous close. Divi's Lab net profit increased by 78 percent to Rs 895 crore in the March quarter against Rs 502 crore a year ago. Revenue from operations rose 40 percent to Rs 2,518 crore as against Rs 1,788 crore a year ago. ""We believe this abnormal growth was derived from Covid-led drugs (similar to last quarter) and is unsustainable going forward with the pandemic subsiding all over the world, except in China. We thus foresee lower growth on a higher base. On the margin front as well, the inflationary environment, coupled with a growth taper, would weigh on performance,"" BoB Capital said in a note to investors. ""Given the current high base, 85 percent capacity utilisation, delays at new plants as well as reduced margins and the absence of abnormal growth, we cut our FY23-FY24 EBITDA estimates by 9-15 percent and lower our target EV/EBITDA multiple from 27x to 26x (implied P/E multiple of 37x) – in line with five-year average multiple,"" the BoB Capital report said. The brokerage firm has downgraded the stock to 'hold' from 'buy' and revised the target price to Rs 4,250 from Rs 5,250 a share earlier. During the quarter, the custom synthesis business grew 60 percent QoQ, while generic APIs recorded a decline of 66 percent. EBITDA margin expanded by 380 basis points on-year to 43.9 percent due to lower other expenses/employee costs (-280bp/-180bp) as a percentage of sales.

3,Supreme Court on GST -- reading between the lines,markets," Though alternatively feared and alternatively seen favorably, the fact is that the recent Supreme Court’s ruling on GST has neither changed the structure of state-Centre balance nor has it damaged the one-nation-one-tax vision. What it has done is lay down how the law gradually developed, what were the give and takes involved in formation of the law and how it will run and what are the challenges that would be faced.

Moreover, while the Court did rule that the levy..."

Auto, technology, private banks stocks and HUL supported the market and cut down the losses. The BSE Sensex declined 38 points to 54,289, while the Nifty50 lost 200 points from the day's high and closed at 16,215, down 51 points, forming a bearish candle on the daily charts. The failure of holding 16,400 levels indicated that the market could remain rangebound in the coming days, experts feel. ""Zooming into the 15-minute chart, we see that the Nifty has failed to convincingly cross the crucial resistance of 16,400 and corrected from the highs. In the process, the index also closed below the 20 and 50-day moving averages. This indicates weakness. Traders will now need to watch if the Nifty can hold above the immediate support of 16,116. Else, we could see a further correction,"" Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities said. The daily time frame of the Nifty indicates that the index has made a double bottom around 15,735 levels and rallied sharply on Friday. The Nifty now needs to move above the recent swing high of 16,400 for the bulls to gain control. Till then, the Nifty could remain rangebound and weak, the market expert said.

We have collated a list of important headlines across news platforms which could impact Indian as well as international markets: US Markets US stocks ended higher on Monday as gains from banks and a rebound in market-leading tech shares supported a broad-based rally following Wall Street's longest streak of weekly declines since the dotcom bust more than 20 years ago. All three major US stock indexes advanced between 1.6% and 2.0%, with the heftiest boost coming from rebounding megacap tech stocks Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 618.34 points, or 1.98%, to 31,880.24, the S&P 500 gained 72.39 points, or 1.86%, to 3,973.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 180.66 points, or 1.59%, to 11,535.28. Asian Markets Asian shares slipped on Tuesday as relief at a rally on Wall Street was quickly soured by a slide in U.S. stock futures, while the euro held near one-month highs as odds narrowed on a July rate rise by the ECB. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.3% in hesitant trading. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and Chinese blue chips eased 0.3%. SGX Nifty Trends on SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 55 points. The Nifty futures were trading around 16,231 levels on the Singaporean exchange. FDI equity inflows marginally down at $58.77 billion in 2021-22: DPIIT data FDI equity inflows into India contracted marginally by 1 per cent to USD 58.77 billion during 2021-22, according to official data. The FDI equity inflows stood at USD 59.63 billion during 2020-21, the data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) showed. However, total foreign direct investment into India rose by 2 per cent to the ""highest ever"" USD 83.57 billion in 2021-22. Total FDI inflows include equity inflows, reinvested earnings and other capital. During 2021-22, Singapore was at the top with USD 15.87 billion worth of investments. It was followed by the US (USD 10.55 billion), Mauritius (USD 9.4 billion), the Netherlands (USD 4.62 billion), Cayman Islands (USD 3.81 billion), and the UK (USD 1.65 billion), the data showed. SEBI allows mutual funds to launch passively-managed ELSS schemes Mutual fund investors will soon get one more option to make tax-saving investments. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on May 23 allowed mutual funds to launch equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) as passively-managed funds as well. SEBI wants such a scheme to be based on an index that comprises the top 250 companies in terms of market-capitalisation. However, there is one caveat. A mutual fund can have either an actively-managed ELSS scheme or a passively-managed one, but not both. So, this will allow new-age fund houses that are focusing on passive schemes, to launch a passively-managed ELSS fund. India's economic growth may have slowed to 3.5% in Q4 FY22: ICRA The economic growth may have slowed to 3.5 percent in fourth quarter of 2021-22 from 5.4 percent in the previous three-month period due to the impact of higher commodity prices on margins, decline in wheat yields and on higher base, ICRA Ratings said on Monday. The agency said the hiccups in the recovery of the contact-intensive services attributable to the third wave of COVID-19 in the country may have also affected the economic growth in the quarter. Even the gross value added (GVA) at basic prices (at constant 2011-12 prices) in Q4 FY2022 seems to have eased to 2.7 percent from 4.7 percent in Q3 FY2022, it said. The National Statistical Office (NSO) will release the fourth quarter numbers of fiscal 2022 on May 31. ICRA’s Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said Q4 was a challenging quarter, with the Omicron-fuelled third wave of COVID-19 arresting the momentum in contact-intensive services, and a pervasive pressure on margins from higher commodity prices. Oil prices ease on concerns over recession, weaker consumption Oil prices eased in early trade on Tuesday as concerns over a possible recession and weaker consumption outweighed an expectation of tight global supply and a pick-up in fuel demand in China after Beijing's promises of stimulus. Brent crude futures for July slid 35 cents, or 0.3%, to $113.07 a barrel by 0122 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for July delivery dropped 36 cents, or 0.3%, to $109.93 a barrel.

11,Gold prices steady after hitting 2-week high on dollar retreat,markets," Gold steadied on Tuesday as the U.S. dollar stabilized after a slide in the previous session that drove greenback-priced bullion to its highest level in two weeks. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold held its ground at $1,852.84 per ounce, as of 0048 GMT, after scaling to its highest since May 9 at $1,865.29 on Monday. U.S. gold futures gained 0.3% to $1,852.40. * The dollar steadied after dropping to a one-month low in the previous session. A weaker dollar makes bullion more attractive for overseas buyers. [USD/] * Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased, buoying demand for zero-yield gold. [US/] * Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said on Monday she expects the U.S. central bank to lift its target interest rate to about 2% by August, with further action dependent on how both supply and demand are affecting inflation. * Bullion, seen as a safe store of value during times of economic crises, tends to become less attractive to investors when U.S. interest rates are raised because it yields nothing. * Asian shares got off to a sluggish start on Tuesday after a rally on Wall Street was soured by an early slide in U.S. stock futures, while the euro was near one-month highs as odds narrowed on a July rate rise by the ECB.[MKTS/GLOB] * SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.44% to 1,068.07 tonnes on Monday from 1,063.43 tonnes on Friday.

12,Asia stocks restrained as US futures retreat,markets," Asian shares got off to a sluggish start on Tuesday after a rally on Wall Street was soured by an early slide in U.S. stock futures, while the euro was near one-month highs as odds narrowed on a July rate rise by the ECB. After ending Monday firmer, Nasdaq futures lost 1.3% with traders blaming an earnings warning from Snap which saw shares in the Snapchat owner tumble 28%. Snap is the first of the major tech apps to report and could cast a shadow over Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Twitter which report next week. S&P 500 futures also lost 0.6%, surrendering some of Monday's 1.8% bounce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was left almost flat as a result, while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1%. Markets have taken some comfort from U.S. President Joe Biden's comment that he was considering easing sanctions on China, and from Beijing's ongoing promises of stimulus. Unfortunately, China's zero-COVID policy, with attendant lockdowns, has already done considerable economic damage. ""Following disappointing April activity data, we have downgraded our China GDP (gross domestic product) forecast again and now look for 2Q GDP to contract 5.4% annualised, previously ?1.5%,"" warned analysts at JPMorgan. ""Our 2Q global growth forecast stands at just 0.6% annualised rate, easily the weakest quarter since the global financial crisis outside of 2020."" Early surveys of European and U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers for May are due out later on Tuesday and could show some slowing in what has been a resilient sector of the global economy. Analysts have also been trimming forecasts for the United States given the Federal Reserve seems certain to hike interest rates by a full percentage point over the next two months. The hawkish message is likely to be driven home this week by a host of Fed speakers and minutes of the last policy meeting due on Wednesday. Yet the European Central Bank is also turning more hawkish, with President Christine Lagarde surprising many by opening the door for a rate rise as early as July. That saw the euro up at $1.0685, having bounced 1.2% overnight in its best session since early March. It now faces stiff chart resistance around $1.0756. The dollar also retreated versus sterling and a range of currencies, taking the dollar index down 0.9% overnight and back to 102.100. Meanwhile the euro jumped sharply to 136.56 Japanese yen, while the dollar held steady at 127.77 yen. The pullback in the dollar helped gold regain some ground to $1,853 an ounce.

13,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with JSW Energy, Easy Trip, Adani Power on Tuesday?",markets," The market after initial volatility gained strength and extended the uptrend for the Nifty50 to climb above 16,400 levels in the afternoon, but the sell-off in the last hour wiped out 200 points gains from day's high and the index settled with moderate losses on May 23, raising question over sustainability and stability. The Nifty50 fell 51 points to 16,215 and formed a bearish candle on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex dropped 38 points to 54,289. The market breadth was also weak as three shares declined for every two advancing shares on the NSE, resulting into a negative close for the broader space. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 0.35 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. The volatility index remained above 20 mark, inching up a bit by 1.28 percent to 23.40 levels which, experts feel, is still indicating a favourable market for bears and discomfort for bulls. The selling pressure in HDFC twins, ITC, Reliance Industries, and Tata Steel weighed down the market, however, the buying in auto, technology, private banks stocks and HUL limited losses. Stocks that were in action included JSW Energy which rallied 5.8 percent to Rs 310.40 on Monday and jumped 26 percent after hitting August 2021's low on May 13; Easy Trip Planners which gained 4.92 percent at Rs 455.35 on Monday and jumped 33 percent from May 12; and Adani Power which was locked in 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 327.85 on Monday, and surged 35 percent from May 12.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced between 1.6% and 2.0%, with the heftiest boost coming from rebounding megacap tech stocks Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

If the benchmark index closes 20% or more below that record, it will confirm it has been in a bear market since then.

15,"Hot Stocks | KSB, Endurance Technologies, Transport Corporation may give up to 12% return in short term. Here's why",markets," Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities From the day's high of 16,414, the Nifty lost more than 200 points to close at 16,214. By falling 700 points from intraday high, BankNifty ended the session with Bearish Shooting Star pattern on the daily chart. Markets have been highly volatile and choppy for last couple of weeks. Last week, the Nifty managed to hold its level above March 2022 bottom of 15,671 and made a higher bottom at 15,775. The Nifty formed bullish triple bottom formation at 15,740 odd levels. Recent swing high was formed at 16,414, above which the benchmark would confirm bullish trend reversal. Nifty daily line chart and RSI (relative strength index) indicates higher chances of index to find support at lower levels.

Last week, Nifty Smallcap Index formed bullish ""Harami"" candlestick pattern, which can be considered as an Inside Bar pattern on the weekly chart. This development after 5 weeks' consecutive fall, indicates the probable bullish trend reversal for markets. Considering the technical evidences discussed above, we believe that Nifty is currently trading in range of 15,750-16,400. However indicators and inter market analysis indicates higher chances of breakout on the upside in the index. Fresh sell signal would only trigger below 15,740 in Nifty.

0,"Taking Stock | Market erases gains to end flat amid volatility; auto shines, metal worst hit",markets," The Indian benchmark indices ended marginally lower in a highly volatile session on May 23, dragged by metal stocks as the government imposed export duties on iron ore and some steel intermediaries. At close, the Sensex was down 37.78 points or 0.07% at 54,288.61, and the Nifty was down 51.50 points or 0.32% at 16,214.70. During the day, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices touched 54,931.30 and 16,414.70, respectively. After a positive start with the Nifty opening above 16,300, the market remained in positive territory in the first half but erased all the gains in the second half to end on a flat note. ""Markets gave up all its gains in afternoon trade today as it simply could not recover after the export tax imposed on steel products with the metal index falling almost 9% to 5,200 levels in morning trade,"" said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP securities. ""The prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict coupled with its consequences and inflationary pressures weighed heavily in the minds of investors and traders."" ""Prospects of additional market borrowings by the GOI in the wake of the tax cuts on fuel to tame inflation also came to the forefront,"" he added. M&M, Maruti Suzuki, HUL, Asian Paints, and Larsen and Toubro were among the top Nifty gainers, while losers included JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Divi's Labs, ONGC, and Hindalco Industries. Among sectors, Nifty Auto and Information Technology indices rose 1 percent each, while the metal index fell 8 percent and the pharma index fell 1 percent.

Also Read - Auto stocks trade higher after government cuts excise duty on fuel Outlook for May 24 Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities After a firm start, markets failed to hold on to their early upsurge and simply lost track to end marginally lower. Metal stocks bore the brunt while automobile, realty, and oil & gas stocks also came under selling pressure, thus dragging key indices lower. Technically, on intraday charts, the Nifty has formed a double top formation and on daily charts, it has formed a Hammer candlestick formation which is broadly negative. For day traders, 16,200 would act as a crucial support level, and below the same, we could see a quick intraday correction till 16,100-16,050. On the flip side, the fresh uptrend is possible only after a 16,300 intraday breakout. On breaching the level, the index could move up to 16,400-16,475. Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a positive note & attempted to scale higher on May 23. It went on to test the crucial level of 16,400 where the index had faced resistance in the last two weeks. 16,400 proved to be a strong barrier yet another time. The hourly chart shows that the upper end of an upward sloping channel also created pressure near 16,400. Thus, the index nosedived towards the end of the session & closed in the red for the day. The overall structure shows that the Nifty is likely to witness sideways action in the short term. 16,000 – 16,400 is expected to be the range for the next few sessions.

1,Rupee recovers from record lows to end 15 paise higher at 77.55/USD,markets," Rupee recovered from record lows and settled 15 paise higher at 77.55 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weak greenback overseas. At the interbank forex market, the domestic unit opened at 77.69 against the US dollar. It moved in a range of 77.51 to 77.69 during the session. The rupee finally snapped its three-session losing streak and closed at 77.55, registering a rise of 15 paise over its previous close. On Friday, the rupee had settled at a record low of 77.70 against the American currency. According Gaurang Somaiya, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, rupee continued to consolidate and volatility remained confined to a narrow range despite choppiness in domestic equities. ""Today volatility for the dollar could remain low as no major economic data is expected to be released from the US. We expect the USD-INR (Spot) to trade sideways and quote in the range of 77.20 and 77.80,” Somaiya added. However, unabated foreign fund outflows and firm crude oil prices weighed on the rupee and kept the appreciation bias capped. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 1 per cent lower at 102.12. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 37.78 points or 0.07 per cent lower at 54,288.61, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 51.45 points or 0.32 per cent to 16,214.70.

2,Government clips steel sector’s wings at wrong moment,markets," The steel sector, which looked all set to be the leader of the much-awaited revival in India’s private investment cycle, has now been left to hold the bag for dousing the flames of inflation in the country. On May 21, the government announced a series of measures to bring down inflation in the country which in April reached multi-month highs and forced the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee into an emergency hike in interest rate of 40 basis points earlier this month. Among the measures announced by the government, the one that could end up having long-term ramifications for India to emerge out of its decade-old slump in private capital expenditure is the move to bring in 15 percent duty on steel exports to reign in domestic prices. Analysts believe the export duty will not only hurt steel companies in terms of profitability as the lucrative export market, which drove earnings at a time when domestic demand was hit by COVID-19, becomes unattractive, but will cloud their long-term expansion plans. India’s finished steel exports rose by 25 percent in 2021-22 to 13.5 million tonnes while the same rose more than 60 percent when compared to the pre-pandemic period, according steel ministry data. Ironically, in March, the Steel Minister Piyush Goyal hailed India’s emergence as a key player in the global steel market as a vindication of the government’s export-focused policies in the pandemic era. The same export-focused policy, which was buttressed by steel import duties to deter countries like China and South Korea from dumping cheaper steel, now appear to have been kept on the backburner to reduce input costs for several steel-consuming industries. “Will it lead to lower price of housing, automobiles, construction? We don’t think so,” said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which has put its coverage on the sector under review in light of the shift in policy. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has termed the government’s measure a “policy shock” that “would slow down growth capex and could eventually force a reversal of duties”. Investors saw the sudden shift of policy in the same vein as shares of Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, JSW Steel, and SAIL tanked 6-16 percent on May 23. Motilal Oswal Financial believes that the measures are a year too late given that at the time profits of steel companies were near record highs and cost of coal was about 20 percent lower, allowing companies to easily absorb the higher cost of export. “The current measure will impact the ability and will of the companies to continue with their long term capex plans and will only commission the capacities where capex has been significantly committed,” Motilal Oswal Financial said in a note. Kotak Equities is of the view that the slowdown in capital expenditure from the sector, generally a key driver of private capex, could force the government to reverse the hike in export duties but “we do no build it in our base case”. Tata Steel, which announced a more than Rs 10,000 crore outlay on capital expenditure for 2022-23, said earlier this month that it will review its capex plan during the middle of the financial year with the expectation of increasing it substantially to bake in its long-term capacity expansion plans. Those plans will likely be put on hold given that much of it was driven by the need to cater to the appetite of global markets, which are dealing with China’s withdrawal as the dragon focuses on cleaning its environment. Jindal Steel and Power’s Managing Director VR Sharma summed up the shock for the industry when he told Reuters that the sector will be forced to cancel orders from European companies, who were counting on India to lend a hand in replacing million tonnes of Russian steel that are now under sanctions. ""This could possibly lead to force majeures. And the customer has done no wrong here and he doesn't deserve to be treated that way,” Sharma told Reuters.

3,Startup claims 'go-between' firm for IPO siphoned off funds,markets," In a stunning, if not, bizarre case of lack of financial know-how and market fraud, BSE-listed startup Trekkingtoes.com has alleged that a firm, acting as a go-between itself and its investment banker during its initial public offering (IPO) has run away with a large chunk of the proceeds of the issue. In an April 13 exchange filing, Trekkingtoes.com told BSE that the major portion of proceeds raised through an IPO by the company had been misappropriated by GYR Capital Advisors (formerly Alpha Numero Services). As per Trekkingtoes.com's complaint to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), GYR Capital Advisors was a consultant and intermediate between Fast Track Finsec and the company. The Jaipur-based company had raised Rs 4.54 crore through a public issue in August 2020. The company is a new-age digital startup involved in intercity cab rental services. “The company has initiated action against them for defrauding the company with the intention of siphoning the proceeds of the IPO, as aptly mentioned in our complaint attached below,” Trekkingtoes.com said. Trekkingtoes has filed a complaint with SEBI against Fast Track Finsec (merchant banker), whose former director Abhishek Vijay Kumar Sharma is a director at Alpha Numero (now known as GYR Capital), Rohit Pareek, and Mohit Baid, director of Alpha Numero, and three others. ""Without any ground or supporting documents they have taken our name in the public domain for which we will take necessary legal actions against in the due course,"" a spokesperson for GYR Capital Advisors said in an email statement. GYR Capital said that neither was it the investment banker nor an advisor to the issue. Promised land In 2020, Trekkingtoes.com’s founders Sahil Agarwal and Sagar Agarwal were approached by Fast Track Finsec, a SEBI-registered category-I merchant banker, with the idea for an IPO. Fast Track convinced the startup’s founders that it could help them raise funds from the market to grow the business instead of relying on the promoters’ own funds, debt and investments from friends and family, as was the case till then, the copy of the complaint filed by the company showed. “It is apposite to mention here that being a start-up and due to their lack of familiarity with the capital market, the Promoters were not well acquainted with and required hand-holding even for basic capital market processes, operations and understanding,” Trekkingtoes.com said in its SEBI complaint. As per the draft red herring prospectus of Trekkingtoes.com, Sagar Agarwal, a whole-time director and chief financial officer at the company, is Bachelor in Commerce (B.Com.) and has cleared Integrated Professional Competence Examination Certificate held by ICAI. Trekkingtoes.com ultimately floated a public offering with the intention of using the funds for strategic initiatives, repayment of some portion of existing debt and general corporate purposes. Red flags The promise of raising much-needed capital for the company and getting itself listed on the stock exchanges quickly turned into an ordeal for Trekkingtoes.com after it took a look at its agreement with the banker to the issue, ICICI Bank, just before the issue. “It was for the first time vide the banker to the issue agreement that the complainant got to know that it would be entitled to utilize only Rs 40-45 lakhs from proceeds of the IPO,” Trekingtoes.com said. According to Trekkingtoes.com, the investment bankers coerced the founders into agreeing to invest Rs 4 crore into other entities suggested by the investment bankers by way of strategic investment or unsecured loans. “The Respondent no. 3 (Abhishek Sharma) stated that if the complainant does not approve of the Respondent No. 1’s (Fast Track Finsec) new and arbitrary arrangement then the whole agreement between the Respondent No. 1 and the complainant would fall apart and the IPO would fail even before it had taken flight,” Trekkingtoes.com said. Trekkingtoes.com argued that since its founders had committed to repaying its debtors and told employees about the IPO, it was forced to agree to the unfavourable terms under “commercial duress”. According GYR Capital Advisors' statement to Moneycontrol, the purpose of the IPO funds was decided by the board of the company in a meeting as mentioned in the prospectus of the issue. ""Board of directors of trekkingtoes.com Ltd. are well qualified includes chartered accountant, IIT etc. and in the board meeting they have decided the fund utilization and identification of companies,"" GYR Capital Advisors said. Further, Trekkingtoes.com claimed that Fast Track Finsec assured the founders that it had conducted due diligence on the companies it wanted Treekingtoes.com to invest in and that the company “would be paid back the money invested in or lent to these companies with suitable interest and that the Trekkingtoes.com is completely secured as regards the entire arrangement”. Muddled Details Disaster struck Trekkingtoes.com in the days following the closure of the IPO on August 20, 2020. Having agreed to invest the majority of the proceeds in four firms shortlisted allegedly by the merchant banker, Trekkingtoes.com signed and emailed agreements with two of them, Swarnsiddhi and OPCL, for unsecured loan agreements. The startup also couriered the same documents to the addresses of the two companies but the delivery failed, raising suspicion that both entities were shell companies. Similarly, Trekkingtoes.com entered into an agreement to buy compulsorily convertible debentures of two others companies suggested by the merchant bankers but did not hear from both entities following the execution of the agreement. On August 28, the day of the market debut when issues arose around the listing of the company, Trekkingtoes.com tried to contact the merchant bankers but got no response. On speaking to ICICI Bank regarding the status of the IPO funds, “the complainant was shocked to learn from the Banker to the Issue that a sum of Rs 4 crore had already been siphoned off from their account”. Collateral damage This is not Fast Track Finsec’s first run-in with the regulator. In January, the merchant banker was penalised for failing to make timely disclosure of an open offer in the case of Sea Gold Infrastructure and AKM Lace and Embrotex—in both cases, it was the lead manager to the issue. However, despite the alleged fraud claimed by Trekkingtoes.com, Fast Track Finsec successfully acted as the lead manager in another SME IPO listing, that of Jeena Sikho Lifecare, on the National Stock Exchange’s Emerge platform without any difficulties. For investors in Trekkingtoes.com, meanwhile, things have been going from bad to worse. Investors faced a double whammy of having its funds allegedly siphoned off by the merchant bankers and also the stock has nosedived since its listing. Having raised funds at an issue price of Rs 105 per share, Trekkingtoes.com’s shares have sunk to Rs 29 each and have been suspended from trading due to penal reasons that spring from the IPO case. While the company has been submitting its quarterly results to the bourse, they are unaudited results that in many occasions were filed late and in some instances did not disclose the results. According to Trekkingtoes.com, the delay in disclosure of financial results is down to its inability to secure the services of a statutory auditor in the light of the diversion of its IPO proceeds.

History suggests an interesting answer: since the Second World War, Fed tightening has led to a range of outcomes for the economy, from hard to softish landings, but has always led to financial crises somewhere — including every major global crisis in recent decades.

5,"As gold loans lose shine, lenders face growth test",markets," Last week, the second largest non-bank gold loan lender spooked its investors by reporting a sharp drop in its assets under management (AUM) growth. Manappuram Finance Ltd reported a mere 5.7 percent growth in its gold AUM for Q4FY22, a weak conclusion to a difficult year.

While one lender’s performance need not stretch to the industry, there are enough signs that gold loans lost their sheen in FY22. What’s more, FY23 may turn out to be another challenging year for lenders.

8,"NSE shares see hectic trading, tax-evaders have a field day",markets," National Stock Exchange’s (NSE’s) shares are seeing heavy trading even as there is little clarity on when the bourse will be able to come out with its initial public offering (IPO). While foreign institutional investors have been sellers of late, local high networth individuals (HNIs) are on a buying spree with several new investors now picking up smaller lots. Unlike earlier, when the minimum lot size used to be 10,000 shares, now brokers are willing to engage in lot sizes of as small as 1,000 shares, or even 500 shares in some cases, accommodating investors willing to deploy smaller sums. This has resulted in a significant rise in the number of shareholders in NSE. This explains heavy trading in NSE shares, despite the absence of a formal platform, over the past year. In FY22, around 5 million NSE shares changed hands on an average every month, which works out to roughly 250,000 shares being transacted every trading day. That’s the kind of delivery-based volumes even many midcap stocks cannot stake claim to. Trading volume last month were down sharply to 2 million shares, but this has to be seen in the context of the broad-based sell off in the stock market. Price action in the stock, however, indicates that tax-evaders may be exploiting this liquid but unlisted stock. A hit with HNIs The number of HNIs owning NSE shares has risen exponentially over the last five years. At the end of FY21, just 7 individuals owned NSE shares. That figure now stands at 1838, with DMart founder Radhakishan Damani, industry captains, and many reputed stock market investors among the shareholders. The strong appetite for NSE shares is not surprising. NSE is India’s number one stock exchange with a 92.5 market share in the equity segment, a near monopoly in the equity derivatives segment, and the dominant player in the currency derivatives segment. Its operating profit margin is close to 70 percent and it is the number one derivatives platform globally according to data by the Futures Industry Association. Wide spreads And yet, for a stock so actively traded, the sharp variation in prices of individual deals is puzzling, even after accounting for the fact that there is no formal mechanism for price discovery. From the table below it can be seen the difference between the lowest price and the highest price in a month is 100 percent or even more than 200 percent at times.  Since the shares are unlisted, the disparity in prices on any given day will be more than what one would normally see in stocks traded on the stock exchanges. Besides the urgency of the counterparty and size of the block (of shares) are key factors deciding the price at which the deal is struck. And yet the difference should not be so wide, for two reasons. One, the NSE publishes details of every transaction, and two, HNIs are savvy enough to know what the prevailing market rates for NSE are. The discrepancy between the lowest and highest prices in a month was not as glaring between June 2020 and March 2021 when HNIs were just beginning to warm to NSE shares. Check table below.  So what explains the gap? Brokers dealing in NSE shares say the sharp discount to market price is usually when the one of the parties in the deal wants to avoid tax outgo or launder unaccounted cash. “In unlisted shares the rates are usually in a band of 5-7 percent or at most 10 percent depending on which side is pushing for the deal,” said a broker. “Anything more than that has nothing to do with fundamentals,” he said. On paper, the deal will be done at a hefty discount (or premium), and the difference settled in cash later. “It is hard to evade tax through deals in listed shares, but when the shares are unlisted, the tax man will have a hard time proving the trades were done way below the fair price,” the broker said. Fair value of NSE shares For financial year 2021-22, NSE’s consolidated revenues rose 53 percent to Rs 9500 crore and consolidated net profit rose around 44 percent to Rs 5184 crore. Earnings per share is Rs 105. Rival BSE, with a much smaller market share, slower growth in revenues, and less than half the operating profit margin, is quoting at roughly 40 times trailing earnings. Using the same yardstick, NSE shares should be valued north of Rs 4000 apiece, not factoring its dominant market position and better return ratios. The gap between the fair value and what it is going for at the moment can be explained by the uncertainty over when the bourse will eventually go public. At present, most deals in NSE shares are being done around Rs 2800 apiece, brokers said. They said that the process of NSE approving the transfer of ownership rights takes anywhere between 3-4 months. So most deals reported by the exchange in April would have been done in December 2021 or January 2022. NSE had filed the draft red herring prospectus for its IPO with SEBI way back in December 2016. However, the DRHP had to be withdrawn after the regulator began investigating a whistleblower complaint that certain trading members were getting preferential access to NSE’s data feed illegally under the colocation facility. Till January this year, many in the market were hopeful that NSE’s IPO would be approved by SEBI soon. But the wait may have got longer after SEBI’s final order on former NSE CEO Chitra Ramakrishna triggered a fresh probe by CBI into the colocation controversy. Ramakrishna and NSE’s ex-COO Anand Subramanian have been arrested and are presently behind bars.

10,Indian rupee rises 4 paise to 77.66 against US dollar in early trade,markets," The rupee appreciated 4 paise to 77.66 against the US dollar in the opening trade on Monday as a positive trend in domestic equities and weak American currency overseas supported the local unit. However, unabated foreign fund outflows and surging crude prices in the international markets restricted the rupee's gain, forex dealers said.

11,Gold Prices Today: Yellow metal to edge higher amid weak dollar and high fuel prices; buy on dips,markets," Gold prices touched a more than one week high on Monday in international markets as an easing dollar continued to support greenback-priced bullion although higher US Treasury yields capped gains. Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,848.96 per ounce by 0201 GMT. At 9:35am, gold contracts were up 0.3 percent at Rs 50,984 for 10 gram on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) while silver added 0.49 percent at Rs 61,705 a kilogram. Gold prices traded higher on Monday with spot gold prices at Comex trading around half a percent up near $1854 per ounce. Gold prices continued upside on weaker dollar which fell below 103 on Monday. Economic growth worries and higher fuel prices may support yellow metal as inflation hedge, said Tapan Patel, Senior Analyst (Commodities), HDFC Securities. ""We expect gold prices to trade up with Comex spot gold support at $1820 and resistance at $1870 per ounce. MCX Gold June support lies at Rs 50600 and resistance at Rs 51200 per 10 gram,"" he said. Track Live Gold Prices Here Trading Strategy Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Gold prices snapped a four-week losing trend, managing to close on a higher note. Last week gold prices gained around two percent while silver prices recovered around six percent from their lows amid a fall in the dollar index and US bond yields. Last week, the dollar index witnessed a steep fall after failing to sustain around the fresh 19 year high at 105. The index eased more than two percent from recent highs and US 10-year bond yields also cooled off and slipped below 2.80 percent. Bullion prices also got support from weak US data. Unemployment claims rose again and existing home sales and the Philly Fed manufacturing index disappointed. This week investors’ focus will remain on the release of the Fed Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, which is due on Friday. Gold has support at $1832-1820 while resistance is at $1858-1870. Silver has support at $21.48-21.20 while resistance is at $22.10-22.38. In rupee terms gold has support at Rs 50,640–50,410 while resistance is at Rs51,140–51,350. Silver has support at Rs 61,010-60,750 while resistance is at Rs 62,350-62,610. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Swastika Investmart Due to continued selling pressure in global stock markets, investors have turned towards precious metals. Gold and silver have registered an increase after a month of continuous decline. The dollar has retreated from two-decade highs and rising concerns over US economic growth have turned investors to safe-haven assets. However, the US Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes and balance sheet cuts will still offer major resistance to gold's bullishness. The cut in the five-year loan prime rate by the People's Bank of China has supported the prices of industrial metals and crude oil, which has also boosted the prices of the precious metals last week. On MCX, a pullback can be seen so buying can be initiated at lower levels where gold has resistance at Rs 51100 and support at Rs 50500. Silver has resistance at Rs 62300 and support at Rs 60500. Amit Khare, AVP- Research Commodities, Ganganagar Commodity Gold and silver prices showed mixed movement on May 20 on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX); June gold contracts closed up by 0.56 percent at Rs 50,829 for 10 grams. July contract Silver futures closed at Rs 61,407 a kilogram, down 0.26 percent. As per technical chart, gold and silver are making bottom and we can see a huge short covering rally in the coming future; momentum indicator RSI is also indicating the same on the hourly as well as daily chart. Traders are advised to create fresh buy positions near given support levels and should focus on important technical levels.

14,"Daily Voice | Market far from being in a stable territory, pick these 4 themes, says Varun Lohchab of HDFC Securities",markets," Commodity prices are yet to stabilize and their future course of movements will dictate future actions of global central banks, hence, we believe market is far from being in a stable territory, Varun Lohchab, Head of Institutional Research at HDFC Securities said in an interview to Moneycontrol. The recent market correction has certainly provided some pockets of interesting investment opportunities, he said, adding HDFC Securities is bullish on the auto sector, which has underperformed for the past few years. The market veteran's advice of the participants is to choose bottom-up stock analysis to pick the fundamentally strong companies. Read the edited excerpts here: Do you think the bear market phase is over? We don't believe that bear market phase is over as the near-term risks might be known but their quantum and duration of existence are still unknown. While we're already in an inflationary environment, it is still to be seen how long does it last for. Prices of key commodities like crude, steel, coal, natural gas and palm oil have shown early signs of stabilizing after a steep rise but are yet to meaningfully decline. Also read - Real estate sector welcomes govt announcement to cut duties on iron, steel inputs Hence, pressure on CPI (consumer price index) and WPI (wholesale price index) continues which is adversely impacting consumption expenditure, household savings and corporate profitability. Also, while market has discounted certain expected interest rate hikes by US FED and RBI, any surprise with respect to quantum or pace of these rate hikes will trigger market jitters. Steeper-than-expected FED rate hikes could increase the quantum of FII outflows impacting market sentiments. As, trajectories of commodity prices are yet to stabilize and their future course of movements will dictate future actions of central banks, we believe market is far from being in a stable territory. Is the expected earnings downgrade in the coming couple of quarters already priced in by the market? As recent leg of commodity inflation became more prominent post outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war in the latter half of February 2022 and intensified subsequently, Q4FY22 earnings results didn't reflect its full impact. We expect the true intensity of inflation impacting earnings of companies in Q1FY23. Aggravating inflation will drive future rate hike decisions of RBI. While direct impact of inflation on commodity consuming companies is discounted, its indirect impact on household consumption sectors led by reduced monthly savings is yet to be priced.

Further increased savings rates will trigger some outflows from equities to less risky assets like bank deposits. Do you think the valuations are looking more attractive now? What are the themes to pick now, especially after the recent correction? The recent market correction has certainly provided some pockets of interesting investment opportunities. We are bullish on the auto sector which has underperformed for the past few years due to various structural reasons. We believe that the worst is behind us and the sector will recover hereafter. Over the medium term, we expect elevated metal prices to soften, supply chain disruptions to improve gradually and a pickup in demand to play out. We also have a positive outlook on select large banks with healthy CASA ratios that will be beneficiaries in a rising interest rate scenario. Lastly, we are also bullish on Indian chemical industry which is witnessing historically high levels of CAPEX on the back of global supply chain diversification. The country is becoming a preferred manufacturing destination for international pharmaceutical & agrochemical clients as domestic companies are rapidly improving upon their technical capabilities. It is imperative to note that while these sectoral trends are expected to play out, investors must do bottom-up stock analysis to pick the fundamentally strongest companies in each industry.

While the macro environment is temporarily subdued, it is expected to bounce back strongly after a pause of few quarters driven by inherent long term tailwinds of Indian economy. Hence, we believe it is opportune time to look beyond current market weakness and invest in high conviction long term ideas rather than focusing on defensive stocks. The recent market sell off has made some fundamentally strong companies available at attractive valuations. Long-term investors with a 3 to 5 years investment horizon can use this opportunity to consolidate positions in their respective high conviction stocks. Such investors should realign the portfolio by trimming high valuation, low growth tail end stocks and replace those by stocks with long term earning growth visibility & moderate valuations.

Also read - Consider buying LIC only if the insurer's metrics improve, says Anil Rego of Right Horizons While rising interest environment helps expansion of net interest margin for banks with healthy CASA, higher bond yields will hurt their treasury portfolios by way of increased mark to market losses. Also, while moderate rise in interest rates help banks as they increase their lending rates, a very steep rate hike can impede credit growth. As, we believe interest rate hikes in India will not be very steep, so select banks are expected to get benefitted. This would be a prudent choice to invest in select large banks with stable CASA franchise. Pertaining to other financial services companies, we are bullish on the long term potential of the insurance and capital market sectors in India. The monthly SIP flows have been strong (grew from Rs 4,335 crore in March 2017 to Rs 12,328 crore in March 2022) and country's demat accounts witnessed a sharp surge (from 4 crore in FY20 to 9 crore in FY22). Also, while the insurance penetration (total gross premium/GDP) in India is growing steadily it is only around 2 percent currently compared to 20-25 percent in developed nations. These are proofs of the financialisation of savings story beginning to play out. Also, there is a long and profitable runway ahead for broking and asset management companies. With so much headway for growth, we are positive on the industry's long-term outlook. One needs to ensure to be stock specific in these industries while making investment decisions. Do you expect three more rate hikes of 50 bps each by Federal Reserve? Do you think the same has already been priced in by the market? US FED chairman has been unequivocal about doing ""whatever it takes"" to control inflation which is at an unprecedented levels in USA. As increasing costs of essential goods and services are outstripping wage gains, FED is expected to keep raising rates till inflation falls in a clear and convincing way. It is widely expected that rates need to be elevated to more than 3 percent from current level of around 1 percent in order to curb inflation meaningfully. In the wake of this situation, another three 50 bps hikes won't be surprising. While direct impacts of interest rate hikes might be already discounted by the market, its secondary impacts are yet to be fully priced in. As US households are relatively highly leveraged, so steep rise in rates will increase monthly mortgage and credit card payments leaving less room for consumption expenditure. Further, savings rate will become more lucrative than earlier. A combination of incentive for savings and an impediment to borrowings will lead to a decline in consumption expenditure. This will adversely impact all rate sensitive consumption sectors namely housing, auto and retail. Currently we are dealing with a multitude of volatile economic variables such as global inflation, high commodity prices, geopolitical tension, supply chain disruptions, etc. Any adverse incremental news flow on any of these could decisively drive central bank future moves and hence can impact an already jittery market. Will the RBI take repo rate above 5 percent considering the increased focus on inflation concerns and elevated oil prices? We expect the RBI to hike rates 3-4 times more this year and expect the terminal repo rate in this cycle at 5.6 percent. The RBI governor has already explicitly stated that the central bank will prioritize reigning in inflation over growth. What makes this inflationary environment particularly difficult is that it is led by global supply chain disruptions. India is particularly impacted because of our import dependence on key commodities such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas. While the repo rate hikes will certainly help in curbing inflation to some extent, global commodity prices will need to soften for inflation to truly ease. It is however imperative to note that the interest rate hikes expected in India will not be as steep as those expected in USA. Hence the impact felt by Indian corporates and households will be less acute compared to their American counterparts.

15,Oil climbs in tight market as US driving season looms,markets," Oil prices rose in early trade on Monday with U.S. fuel demand, tight supply and a slightly weaker U.S. dollar supporting the market, as Shanghai prepares to reopen after a two-month lockdown fuelled worries about a sharp slowdown in growth. Brent crude futures rose 82 cents to $113.37 a barrel at 0126 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed 69 cents, or 0.6%, to $110.97 a barrel, adding to last week's small gains for both contracts. ""Oil prices are supported as gasoline markets remain tight amid solid demand heading into the peak U.S. driving season,"" said SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes. ""Refineries are typically in ramp-up mode to feed U.S. drivers' unquenching thirst at the pump."" The U.S. peak driving season traditionally begins on Memorial Day weekend at the end of May and ends on Labour Day in September. Analysts said despite fears about soaring fuel prices potentially denting demand, mobility data from TomTom and Google had climbed in recent weeks, showing more people were on the roads in places like the United States. ""High frequency data suggests demand continues to grow,"" ANZ analysts said in a note. A weaker U.S. dollar also sent oil higher on Monday, as that makes crude cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. Market gains have been capped, however, by concerns about China's efforts to crush COVID with lockdowns, even with Shanghai due to reopen on June 1. Lockdowns in China, the world's top oil importer, have hammered industrial output and construction, prompting moves to prop up the economy, including a bigger-than-expected mortgage rate cut last Friday.

17,"Stock selloff to intensify as fresh 10% plunge looms, survey finds",markets," Get ready for a fresh slump in the world’s most-watched stock index, as economic growth fears spiral and the Federal Reserve embarks on its biggest policy-tightening campaign in decades. With the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market last week and notching more than $1 trillion in losses, participants in the latest MLIV Pulse survey reckon there’s more pain to come. The gauge is likely to keep falling this year before bottoming at around 3,500, according to the median projection of 1,009 respondents. That represents a decline of at least 10% from the Friday close of 3,901 -- and a gut-wrenching 27% drop from the January peak.  The Fed’s hawkish-at-all-costs posture, the chaos in supply chains and intensifying threats to the business cycle are all undermining confidence in Corporate America’s profit machine, while equity valuations keep sinking. Money managers endured a worse drawdown in the Covid-spurred tumult of 2020, but that’s scant consolation with projected losses of this scale. “I still think the worst is not behind us,” said Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Corp., on Bloomberg Television Friday. “There’s a pervasive fog of negative sentiment out there.” Sobering profit assessments from the likes of retailer Target Corp. and network-equipment company Cisco Systems Inc. saw investors take the ax to share prices last week. Short interest in a popular exchange-traded equity fund jumped near levels last seen in March 2020. The renewed haven bid for US government bonds suggests money managers are getting increasingly fearful about the economic trajectory, with lockdowns in China and the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict taking their toll. As the retail-stock meltdown kicked off last week, respondents became more bearish over the latter part of the May 17-20 polling period. On average MLIV professionals in the research, risk management and sales community were more pessimistic than their peers in portfolio management and sell-side trading. (The mean data can be skewed by outlier views.) Meanwhile, Marko Kolanovic at JPMorgan Chase & Co. is downplaying fears of an oncoming US recession and the median estimate from prominent Wall Street strategists suggests the index will close the year out at 4,800, suggesting hopes for a market bounce later this year. For Kristina Hooper, while an economic downturn is “pretty much priced in,” she doesn’t see that happening. “Sentiment is very negative, which supports the view we’re closer to the bottom,” said the chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd. Yet as central bankers seek to engineer a tightening of financial conditions to moderate excesses, the risks of further cross-asset chaos is very real. Asked which event will take place before the Fed shifts to dovish policy, 47% of respondents said they anticipated the S&P 500 falling 30% from its peak, while a similar proportion said US unemployment would rise to 6%, from 3.6% currently. More than 40% expect investment-grade credit spreads to blow out beyond 250 basis points before the monetary-easing cycle kicks in, while around one-in-four see American home prices tumbling 20%. Asked which asset class would need to see further declines before the risk-aversion cycle blows over, readers overwhelmingly cited equities, while housing, commodities and bonds also received submissions. Meanwhile, some 31% of respondents said the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle would deliver the biggest boost to growth and 27% indicated a preference for a scenario whereby China ends its zero-Covid policy. Around one in five said that a bigger growth dividend would come if the war in Ukraine were to end, and a similar proportion voted for a drop in crude oil to $70 a barrel.

18,Top 10 trading ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks as market snaps five-week losing streak,markets," The market snapped a five-week losing streak and closed 3 percent higher in the week ended May 20. Volatility remained on the higher side amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis, and fear of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. After losing more than 11 percent in the previous five weeks, the Nifty50 closed decisively above 16,000 mark at 16,266, up nearly 500 points and formed a bullish candle on the weekly scale. The index also closed way above 5 and 10 days simple moving averages whose value placed above 16,060 levels. The index has not fallen below its March lows (15,671) and also held strongly above the 15,700 mark, which both could act as strong support levels in coming days and sustaining above 16,000 could take the index beyond 16,600 mark, experts said. ""With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart which has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said. On the flipside, he said, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600. ""And till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key."" Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. ""This we believe should do extremely well if market remains above the psychological support of 16,000,"" Sameet Chavan said. Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 20 closing prices: Expert: Vinay Rajani, CMT and Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Chalet Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 302.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 335 | Return: 11 percent  Elecon Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 204.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 227 | Return: 11 percent The stock has surpassed the previous top resistance of Rs 200 with rising volumes. Stock has broken out from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly charts. It has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily charts. Indicator and oscillator setup is bullish on short to medium term charts.  KSB: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,455.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,595 | Return: 10 percent The stock surged more than 8 percent with a jump in volumes on May 20, 2022. It has registered fresh all-time high of Rs 1,484. It has broken out from the “flag” pattern on the weekly charts. It is placed above all important moving averages, which indicates a bullish trend on all time-frames. Indicators and oscillators have been showing strength in the current uptrend.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities KEC International: Buy | LTP: Rs 379.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 345 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 16 percent The stock is turning positive on the daily chart. For the past two months, the major oscillator MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has been trending up, while the price is making lower lows, indicating a change in the prevailing trend in the near future. It had formed the lowest level at Rs 345 and bounced back sharply. We expect further upside in the near term. It is at Rs 380 and the strategy should be to buy at current levels and add more at Rs 355. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 345. At higher levels, the stock would face resistance at Rs 410 and Rs 440.  Nestle India: Buy | LTP: 16,862 | Stop-Loss: Rs 16,000 | Target: Rs 18,500 | Return: 10 percent The stock was in an extended corrective wave. In September 2021, it was at Rs 20,610 and, in the last week, it was at Rs 16,000. Technically, we think it has completed the correction at Rs 16,000 and has bounced back sharply along with sectoral movement. Until the stock breaks the Rs 16,000 level, it will continue to move higher. During the corrective pattern, the stock spent the maximum time at Rs 18,500, which should be its first price target. Our advice is to buy at the current levels and place a stop-loss at Rs 16,000.  Grasim Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,488.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,430 | Target: Rs 1,600 | Return: 7.5 percent The stock is forming a double-bottom formation at Rs 1,430. It is still in corrective mode, however, the Rs 1,400 level should act as a trend decider level for the stock. Unless the stock breaks the Rs 1,430 level, we can see the stock rallying towards Rs 1,575-1,600 level. Last year also the level of Rs 1,430 acted as the key support and helped the stock to take the level of Rs 1,600 at the minimum level and Rs 1,800 level at the maximum. It is advisable to buy between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,450 levels. However, stop-loss is mandatory at Rs 1,430 level.  Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking Inox Leisure: Buy | LTP: Rs 493 | Stop-Loss: Rs 465 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 10 percent Inox Leisure witnessed a marginal dip after making a new record high and retraced to the support zone of the neckline (breakout) area of the previous consolidation range. It has spent nearly two weeks around that zone while holding firmly above the support zone of medium term moving average (100 EMA) on the daily chart.  TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 684.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 640 | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 10 percent We see a decent traction in the auto space despite the prevailing corrective phase and TVS Motor is among the top performers. Broadly, it has been consolidating in a range and currently trading around the upper band of the same. The chart pattern indicates a strong possibility of a breakout so traders can consider initiating long positions within Rs 680-685 levels.  Deepak Nitrite Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,972 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,085 | Target: Rs 1830 | Return: 7 percent It has been trading in a declining channel for the last seven months and currently trading below the support zone of major moving averages. The recent upswing has resulted in the formation of a fresh shorting pivot which may result in a decline towards the lower band of the channel ahead. We thus recommend creating shorts on an uptick within Rs 1,980-2,000 zone.  Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com Britannia Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,450.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,340 | Target: Rs 3,640 | Return: 5.5 percent The FMCG space has recently bucked the trend and inspite of the broader market correction, certain stocks from this sector have managed to hold well. This stock was trading in a falling channel and after some consolidation; prices have given a breakout from the channel. The ‘RSI Smoothened’ oscillator, too, is indicating a positive momentum and thus, we expect an up move in prices in the near term. Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,450-3,430 for potential target of Rs 3,640 in next few weeks. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 3,340.  Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 130.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 122 | Target: Rs 144 | Return: 10.5 percent Recently, the stock has managed to show a relative outperformance during market correction and the prices have given a breakout from its resistance zone on Friday. The breakout was supported with high volumes which is a positive signs. Also, it has resumed the ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ structure which indicates that this stock could witness further buying interest in the near term. Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 130-127 for potential target of Rs 144 in next few weeks. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 122.

21,Gold hits over 1-week high as US dollar dips,markets," Gold prices touched a more than one-week high on Monday, as an easing dollar supported greenback-priced bullion, although rising U.S. Treasury yields capped gains. FUNDAMENTALS Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,850.39 per ounce, by 0039 GMT, their highest since May 12. U.S. gold futures GCv1 also gained 0.3% to $1,847.90. The dollar began the week on the back foot, following its first weekly loss in nearly two months, as investors cut bets on more dollar gains from rising U.S. rates and hoped that easing lockdowns in China can aid global growth. USD/ A weaker dollar makes bullion more attractive for overseas buyers. However, benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields firmed, limiting demand for zero-yield gold. US/ St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard reiterated his view last week that the U.S. central bank ought to raise interest rates to 3.5% this year to get high inflation more quickly under control. (Full Story) Bullion, seen as a safe store of value during times of economic crises, tends to become less attractive to investors when U.S. interest rates are raised because it yields no interest. Asian stocks faced an uncertain start on Monday as persistent inflation fears and the prospect of rising interest rates dogged the global economic outlook. MKTS/GLOB SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.69% to 1,063.43 tonnes on Friday from 1,056.18 tonnes on Thursday.

3,NSE adds BHEL as fifth stock to F&O ban list for Monday,markets," The National Stock Exchange has decided to add Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) as the fifth stock on its F&O ban list for May 23 after the scrip crossed 95 percent of the market-wide position limit. Delta Corp, GNFC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, and Punjab National Bank are already on the list. GNFC and Delta Corp were amongst the top five stocks that saw huge short covering on last Friday. State-owned power equipment manufacturer BHEL surged nearly eight percent to close at Rs 53.10 last Friday.

If derivative contracts in securities cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, they end up on the ban list, the NSE said. “All clients/members shall trade in the derivative contracts of the said security only to decrease their positions through offsetting positions. Any increase in open positions shall attract appropriate penal and disciplinary action,” it said.

5,Asia markets tussle with inflation and rates concerns,markets," Asian stocks faced an uncertain start on Monday as persistent inflation fears and the prospect of rising interest rates dogged the global economic outlook, which remains mired in negative sentiment. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.04% higher, after U.S. stocks ended the previous session with negligible gains for the day. The index is down 3.6% so far this month. In early trade, Australian shares gained 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei stock index was 0.85% higher. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.7883% from its U.S. close of 2.787% on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.5869%, up from 2.583%. Uncertainty in market sentiment this week follows the S&P 500's meagre gains on Friday of just 0.01%. The Nasdaq declined 0.30% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%. Despite the marginal gains, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded their seventh straight weeks of losses, the longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. Inflationary pressures remain top of mind for investors, given German wholesale inflation figures published on Friday showed a higher than expected jump indicating prices will remain elevated in the short term future. Germany's producer price index for April rose 2.8% for the month, which meant annual growth was a persistently high 33.5%. In Australia, the Labor Party ended a near 10 year rule of conservative government at a general election on the weekend While Labor has promised climate, housing and enhanced social welfare reforms analysts do not believe the change in government will crate major implications for the nation's economy. ""In our view there was little proposed by the incoming government during the election campaign that at this stage requires us to revisit our economic forecasts,"" CBA economists wrote on Monday. ""Put another way, our economic forecasts and call on the RBA are unchanged despite the change of national leadership."" In early Asian trade, the dollar rose 0.04% against the yen to 127.9. It is still some distance from its high this year of 131.34 on 2022-05-09. U.S. crude dipped 0.04% to $110.24 a barrel. Brent crude rose 0.23% to $112.68 per barrel. The concerns over global economic growth has prompted renewed support for gold. ""Gold prices saw the first weekly gain since mid-April as safe haven demand was boosted by concerns over economic growth amid high inflation,"" ANZ analysts said in a research note on Monday. ""A weaker U.S. dollar has also boosted investor appetite."" Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
6,"Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on Petronet LNG, Axis Bank for short term",markets," Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One We started the proceedings last Monday on a positive note despite sluggish global cues. In an initial hour, the gains extended to move towards 16,000 mark. Similar to recent trends, the profit-booking took place at higher levels to erase all gains around the midsession. Although the market recovered slightly thereafter, the overall movement was quite choppy to conclude the day around 15,850, with nearly four-tenths of a percent gains. This was followed by a massive relief move last Tuesday, which extended towards 16,400 on the subsequent day. However, the global weakness struck back once again on the weekly expiry session with a huge gap-down to retest 15,800. The market was not done with its twists as Friday's session opened with yet another gap; but this time it was fortunately on the higher side. This pleasant surprise picked up its momentum as the day progressed, to conclude the week convincingly above 16,200 mark. The second half of the week gone by was full of dramatic twists and turns. Both the counterparties were caught napping in all this but, as we mostly say ‘all's well that ends well’, eventually the bulls turned out to be victorious as they managed to pull the Nifty back inside the safe terrain by gaining over 3 percent from previous week's close. With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart who has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone. On the flipside, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600 and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key. Let's see how things pan out this week. It would be important to keep a regular tab on global developments and one should certainly be prepared for surprising moves on either side. As far as sectoral participation is concerned, we witnessed some decent relief moves in most of the beaten heavyweight spaces this week. Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs which, we believe, should do extremely well if the market remains above the psychological support of 16,000. Here are two buy calls for short term: Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 227.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 217.80 | Target: Rs 245 | Return: 7.5 percent If we take a glance at the price action for last ten odd months, we can clearly see rangebound movement with slightly negative bias. Stock prices continued with its lower lows lower highs configuration all this while and has faced tremendous resistance around the sturdy wall of '200-day SMA'. Of late, we witnessed lot of changes structurally as prices managed to turn the tide upwards by confirming 'Higher Highs Higher Lows' and importantly, has managed to finally traverse the '200-SMA' with some authority. There are no exceptional volumes as such, but are certainly much higher than its previous average daily volumes, which provides credence to the move. Hence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 245. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 217.80.  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 673.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 657 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 4 percent Overall financial space has been one of the worst performing spaces in last couple of months and 'Axis Bank' has certainly contributed in it to the fullest. After witnessing a 20 percent price correction from recent highs, the stock prices finally saw some respite around the multi-month supports of Rs 640 – 630. On last Friday, we could see first sign of strength after sustaining beyond the '5-day EMA' along with positive crossover in 'RSI-Smoothened' oscillator from its deeply oversold territory. Hence, if global market remains stable, this stock is likely to give decent relief rally in the coming week. We recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 700. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 657.  Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
7,"IT, pharma, FMCG, telecom likely to attract institutional flows in near term post recent correction",markets," Mitesh Dalal, Director and Chief Investment Strategist at Standard Chartered Securities (India) May 2022 has been a highly volatile month for equities, with Nifty50 nearing to lows seen in July 2021. Unscheduled surprised rate hike by Reserve Bank of India and sharp rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve has led to muted sentiments across the global equities. High inflation continues to be the key concern around the globe for central banks, mainly fuelled by geo-political issues causing disruption in supply chain around the globe. Markets eventually are likely to adjust themselves with increasing interest rate scenarios, while focus on earnings can provide healthy portfolio returns going ahead to investors. We expect the volatility, which is at its peak currently, to subside in the coming months as the ongoing earnings season brings better clarity on the demand, arrival of monsoon on southern cost of India and a possible resolution to the geo-political issues. The key concern around inflation across the world is likely to normalise post resolution of the geo-political issues. The current equity valuations (12-month Forward Nifty50 PE ratio is currently nearing its long-term average) provides further comfort as consensus has started factoring c.75-100bps of rate hike by RBI in next 9-12 months along with c.150bps of rate hike getting priced by US FED. Q4 FY22 earnings season has not seen any significant downgrades in earnings estimates. Companies with sustainable growth at reasonable valuations are likely to defend the valuation de-rating across the markets in the current rising interest rate scenario. Management commentaries across the sectors seems to be bullish around demand scenario while margin pressures persist. The much-required correction/volatility in markets has provided investors an opportunity to add exposure to equities for the long term in a systematic manner. While it's difficult to guess the bottom, adding exposure in current dips is likely to provide healthy returns over the longer term. Technically, Nifty has support c. 15,500 (c.500points downside) while we do expect Nifty returns to be even year-on-year (c.17600 CY22). Our positive bias remains towards large private sector banks (valuations are favourable versus growth opportunities). Defensives like IT, Pharma, FMCG and Telecom are likely to attract institutional flows in the near term post the recent correction. Export opportunities in agrochemical companies, industrial components are likely to find sustained earnings growth over the long-to-medium term. Based on technical chart readings, FMCG / consumer stocks are likely to find short term bounce from their distress levels. Key risks: Crude oil sustaining above the $100 a barrel mark could present a challenge for tackling inflation and act as a risk for fiscal math. Interest rate hikes to compress valuation multiples as cost of equity and cost of debt increase.

8,Markets may face volatility amid derivatives expiry; global trends and FII trading key: Experts,markets," Global factors and trading activity of foreign institutional investors are expected to guide domestic market sentiments this week, while equity benchmarks may face volatility amid monthly derivatives expiry, analysts said. Indian markets have been witnessing volatile trades for the past several trading sessions. However, the Nifty managed to break its five-week losing streak and ended with a decent weekly gain of 3 per cent, said Santosh Meena, head of research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Inflation and slowdown in the global economy means stagflation is a key concern for the global equity markets, ""therefore, we are seeing relentless selling by FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors). However, Indian markets are in a better position due to support from domestic investors,"" he added. ""The market may remain volatile this week due to May month expiry. On the global front, minutes of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting will be released on 25th May, which will be an important trigger, while movement of the dollar index and commodity prices will be other important factors,"" Meena said. Yesha Shah, head of equity research, Samco Securities, said, ""The volatility observed last week is expected to continue considering major economic data releases, the current earnings season and the monthly expiry. The FOMC minutes, US GDP growth rate forecasts and initial jobless claims will all influence global market sentiment."" Last week, the Sensex climbed 1,532.77 points or 2.90 percent, while the Nifty jumped 484 points or 3.06 percent. Last week, the Sensex climbed 1,532.77 points or 2.90 percent, while the Nifty jumped 484 points or 3.06 percent. ""Overall we expect this volatility to continue this week as well with several macro headwinds like high inflation and aggressive interest rate hike. Also heavy FII selling continued, which added to the overall pressure in the market,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, head — retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

9,"Daily Voice | Consider buying LIC only if the insurer's metrics improve, says Anil Rego of Right Horizons",markets," ""In the IT space, largecaps have corrected close to 20 percent and the midcaps close to 30 percent due to margin contractions in the last few quarters on high attrition, but demand continues to be robust while some slowdown is expected in the medium term,"" Anil Rego, founder and fund manager of Right Horizons PMS said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Right Horizons is bullish about quality names on a longer-term horizon beyond four to five years as they are available at attractive valuations. On Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) which saw a tepid listing, he said: ""Sales of newer policies are lower, pay-outs are increasing, less people are paying premiums for the policies purchased and metrics like VNB (value of new business) margin are one-third of the industry."" Hence, Rego said it is better to avoid LIC unless VNB margins and other metrics improve. Do you think the market has discounted all negatives? Markets are sort of leading indicators, pricing in information. While we are in times of uncertainty it is the unexpected that has led to sharp downmoves recently and expected factors have been priced in making the markets reasonably valued; historically when Nifty PE trades below 20 we have seen decent returns in the following years. It is difficult to predict the short term so any sharp upmoves depend on the type of information that may come in but the fact of the matter is commodity cost pressure is impacting interest rates and profitability of companies although the cause for concern is the same across the globe and as such is priced in. But what is different for India is we are in a position that is fundamentally sound compared to peers because of deglobalisation after the pandemic and the underlying policies that have been and are tailwinds for growth. We recommend not to rush into deploying cash all at once because markets may become even more attractive, but experience has taught us never to time the market. So one can look to exploit opportunities with a gradual approach over the next few months. Are you bullish on telecom, which is largely a two player market now? In a recent interview, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal mentioned that the firm is likely to push through a tariff hike in 2022, with expectations of increasing ARPU (average revenue per user) to Rs 200; the subscriber addition may remain muted depending on whether the market is ready to absorb this hike, but revenues may increase sequentially. In a price-sensitive sector, one needs to track the players very closely and see how subscriber additions and absorption of such hikes play out to take a long-term call. If Jio were to go public the telecom sector may be in for a re-rating. Is it the right time to bet on IT services? In the IT space, largecaps have corrected close to 20 percent and midcaps close to 30 percent due to margin contractions in the last few quarters on high attrition but demand continues to be robust while some slowdown is expected in the medium term. We are bullish about quality names on a longer-term horizon beyond four to five years as they are available at attractive valuations. Should one start taking exposure to auto space or wait for the situation to improve? It is the supply side issues that are the headwinds, demand is not an issue any more; it was the inability to service the demand that has been a major issue. However, with the expectation of improvement in the supply chain, steel prices cooling down and debottlenecking being exercised, companies have announced higher capex plans for FY23. Tata Motors for example has raised capex by 30 percent to Rs 32,000 crore in FY23 hoping to extend a strong recovery and is sitting on a record booking of over 2.5 lakh units or Rs 1.1 lakh crore of business, which needs to be delivered in six to nine months. Jaguar Land Rover is sitting on its highest ever booking of 1.68 lakh units whereas the passenger vehicle business is a little over 75,000 units to 1 lakh. Considering the demand outlook, product launches, and attractive valuations, we are positive on Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland in the commercial vehicle space, and among ancillaries we prefer Sona BLW Precision Forgings. What is your take on LIC that has seen a tepid listing? When it comes to LIC it is not necessarily the pricing or the industry that is the issue; sales of newer policies are lower, pay-outs are increasing, less people are paying premiums for the policies purchased and metrics like VNB (value of new business) margin are one-third of the industry. As things stand now it is better to avoid LIC; one may consider taking a stance if there's an improvement in VNB margins and other metrics. BSE IPO index fell more than 30 percent in the last six months. What are your thoughts on the Indian IPO market that has seen several listings since last year, but around 40 percent of them are way below their issue prices including new age companies?. The number of listings will always be the highest in the years when markets are in a bull run due to the euphoria as investors look forward to listing gains without considering the underlying businesses. India witnessed a high number of listings from various new-age technology-driven and emerging sectors in 2021. However, as the market enters a sense of fear, stocks with no clear view of profitability will be discarded and discounted and that is what was witnessed in the last few months. What are your thoughts on eMudhra and Aether Industries IPOs? Do you expect muted listing for Delhivery and Venus Pipes? We have always been of the view to pick companies with strong fundamentals because such firms are resilient and thrive; this has been proven more so in the last two years than ever and as such we never look at investment for the sake of listing gains. Any business available at premiums should be avoided especially in the present market scenario.

Call writing was seen at 16300 strike while meaningful put writing was seen at 16000 then 16100 strike. ""Volatility has fallen from higher zones from 24.55 to 23.10 levels, which supported for some smart pullback and now needs to come down for market stability,"" said Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities. ""Nifty witnessed a strong recovery as the benchmark index ended about three percent higher. On the daily chart, the index has formed a double bottom. Immediate resistance is visible at 16400 and a decisive breakout above 16400 may induce a rally towards 16600-16700. On the lower end, support is visible at 16000,"" De added. 9) Rupee After hitting a new low in the last week, dollar-rupee will remain in focus as the domestic currency inched towards 78 level and touched a fresh record low of 77.92 in the week ended May 20. The rupee has erased some of its intra-week losses despite the sell-off in equities. Further positive news from China should improve sentiments and trigger a re-test of 77.25 levels. A move above 77.80 though will open targets of 78.25 levels for the current leg of rupee depreciation, said Emkay Global Financial Services. 10) Russia-Ukraine war Global investors will keep an eye on the fresh development on the Russia-Ukraine war situation as Russia has suffered huge setbacks and heavy losses of men and equipment in the 86 day war. The Group of Seven leading economies agreed Friday to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid to Ukraine to ensure its finances do not hinder its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion. Italy's foreign minister said on Friday that the nation has submitted a peace plan for Ukraine to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said during a Council of Europe meeting in Turin, Italy, that the plan submitted on Thursday calls for local cease-fires to evacuate civilians along humanitarian corridors, and creating the conditions for a general cease-fire leading to a long-lasting peace, Reuters reported.

13,"Shree Cement Q4 Results | Standalone profit falls 16% YoY to Rs 645 crore; revenue grows 3.6% to Rs 4,099 crore",markets," Shree Cement Limited on May 21 reported a 16 percent decline in standalone net profit of Rs 645 crore in the fourth quarter of FY22, as against Rs 768 crore recorded a year ago. On a sequential basis, the profit increased by 31 percent from Rs 492 crore earned during the October–December period. Standalone revenues for the Rajasthan-based cement major rose 3.6 percent on-year to Rs 4,099 crore as compared to a revenue of Rs 3,958 crore registered in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, the revenue was 15.4 percent higher from Rs 3,552 crore recorded in the previous quarter, according to the exchange filing from Shree Cement. The year-on-year decline in profit was due to surge in power and fuel costs, along with the high base of last year’s quarter. Meanwhile, the sequential growth was aided by higher volumes and better realizations during the quarter. For the full-year period from April – March 2022, the standalone PAT witnessed a growth of 2.8 percent to Rs 2,377 crore from Rs 2,312 crore achieved during FY21. Standalone revenues for FY22 jumped 13 percent to Rs 14,306 crore from the revenues of Rs 12,669 crore for last year. The cost of raw materials as a percentage of revenues declined 70 bps on year to 6.6 percent. On a sequential basis, the saving was 140 bps. Employee costs as a percentage of revenue witnessed a steady decline both on year and quarter-on-quarter basis to 4.8 percent, compared to 6.2 percent during the same period last year and 5.5 percent during the previous quarter, said Shree Cement. The rise in energy prices have inflated the power bill for the company 10.1 percent on year and 3.4 percent on quarter. The power cost as a percentage of revenue came in at 26.2 percent during the quarter. The impact of rise in crude oil prices was visible in the rising freight and forwarding charges compared to previous quarter to 23 percent, a sequential increase of 1.5 percent. On a yearly basis, however, the freight cost declined by 1.1 percent. On February 1, the company started commercial operations of its clinker grinding unit at Patas in Pune District having a capacity of 3.0 MTPA (million tonnes per annum). On March 28, it started the commercial operations of its 12,000 tpd (tons per day) or 4MTPA clinker unit (kiln 3) at Beloda Bazar in Raipur district. The company has recommended a final dividend of Rs 45 per equity share of Rs 10 each for the financial year ended March 2022.

14,"Daily Voice | Sonam Srivastava of Wright Research advises caution on eMudhra IPO, expects tepid listing for Delhivery, but Venus at premium",markets," “eMudhra is India’s most significant licensed certifying authority. The company has issued over 50 million digital signature certificates through 88,457 channel partners. But it will list at a PE of 78.81x within a highly competitive industry. So, we advise investors to be cautious,” Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Thanks to retail investors, the IPO of Venus Pipes was subscribed 16.31 times on the final day. “We expect the stock to open at a premium. Venus Pipes will be an excellent addition to the listed stainless steel pipes and tubes segment with a strong export presence,” she said. However, Delhivery’s IPO hardly sailed through, and retail investors barely participated. “We expect the listing to be tepid and damaging as the current market hates high-growth tech stocks with negative earnings,” she said. Do you think the market has bottomed out after the recent correction, and is ready for a sharp upmove? The last six months have taught us that picking the market bottom is a futile exercise in adverse macroeconomic conditions. We are at a low point in the market despite a robust economy. Moreover, the rise in inflation worldwide, persistent geopolitical tensions, and worsening conditions in China are some things that still worry investors. Despite the sharp upward rally in the last week, no one can certainly say that the markets are ready to bounce back. These are the times to be cautious and exercise your risk management muscles. The telecom space, which is largely a two-player market now, has seen strong growth in ARPUs, especially after the tariff hikes in November last year. Do you expect more tariff hikes in the coming period, and are you bullish on these players? Both Bharti Airtel and Idea have posted increase in revenues and seen good days after announcing the tariff hikes and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Both Gopal Vittal of Bharti Airtel and Ravinder Thakkar of Idea have signalled that more hikes are coming in the next quarter. Telecom ARPUs have been sustainably low since Jio disrupted the space, and we will see them rising soon. The hikes will help the revenue and EBIDTA numbers of the two players. In this volatile market where rates rise, cash is king, and increasing cash flows won’t hurt anybody. The telecom sector is seeing a structural revival, and the 5G rollout will be exciting. We are watching this sector optimistically. The IT services space has corrected nearly 20 percent in the recent correction. Where do you see value in this space and should one stick to frontline players instead of mid-caps and small-caps? The IT services sector is buoyant structurally. But with rising margin concerns from a potential macro slowdown and increased exposure to the US, the industry earning cycle might be in trouble. JP Morgan even downgraded the sector and said that the peak revenue is behind us, and EBIT margins are trending down due to inflation and mean reversion. We think, IT is a decent bet while the US hikes rates, but the simultaneous debacle in the US markets has discouraged the sector. So, we are cautious here, and sticking to larger players might make sense. The auto space has been facing issues on the demand as well as supply sides. Should one start taking exposure to the space or wait for the situation to improve? The auto sector has been surprisingly robust over the last month amid the market decline, which might be due to mean reversion effects or because demand in the industry remains high. The auto sector is struggling on the supply side due to semiconductor shortages while people are still waiting for their cars. As inflation rises, demand is seen to be impacted, and global forces, especially the China showdown, which shrunk their auto demand by 40 percent, can impact this sector. The sector’s fate would be governed by the inflation numbers and the revival of consumer sentiment. We are not yet buying but watching this sector. LIC has seen a tepid performance on its listing day. Do you think the stock is still overpriced or is there an issue with the life insurance space as a whole? The valuations at which LIC got listed were cut from the previous numbers discussed but were still on the expensive side for the old world stock in an industry that is growing more and more competitive and digital. The tepid performance could be due to the broader bearish market dynamics due to inflationary pressures and tight monetary policy. In addition, insurance stocks across the board are weak as they anticipate lower demand. Therefore, LIC stockholders need to be patient and wait for the market to return. The BSE IPO index fell more than 30 percent in the last six months. What are your thoughts on the Indian IPO market that has seen several listings since last year, but around 40 percent of them are way below their issue prices, including new-age companies? The IPO market premium is primarily linked to the sentiment in the secondary markets. When the markets are euphoric, IPOs demand premium valuations, but no one likes an overvalued company in tough times, especially if the profits are low. The new-age companies face the same problem. They might have a long way to profitability, and in such volatile times, no one trusts exorbitant growth projections. Nevertheless, companies in attractive sectors with good profitability track records and reasonable valuations are still being lapped up by IPO investors. Therefore, we look at the IPO market to keep on bringing exciting companies to the listed space. What are your thoughts on the IPOs of eMudhra and Aether Industries? Do you expect muted listing for Delhivery, Venus Pipes, and Prudent Corporate? eMudhra is India’s most significant licensed certifying authority. The company has issued over 50 million digital signature certificates through 88,457 channel partners. But it will list at a PE of 78.81x within a highly competitive industry. So, we advise investors to be cautious. Click Here To Read All IPO News Aether Industries is a specialty chemicals manufacturer in India with solid revenue and growth numbers. Given the increasing focus on specialty chemicals in the Government of India's PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme and the China+1 strategy, we see this sector come in flavour soon. Prudent Corporate Advisory’s shares made a muted stock market debut with profit booking post listing. The stock opened for trading at Rs 660 and quickly slipped below Rs 550 levels. This shows that many investors joined the IPO only for the listing gains. Thanks to retail investors, the Venus Pipes IPO was subscribed 16.31 times on the final day, and we expect the stock to open at a premium. Venus Pipes will be an excellent addition to the listed stainless steel pipes and tubes segment with a strong export presence. Investors might dump the stocks on listing day to lock-in to the listing gains even after a positive listing. The Delhivery IPO hardly sailed through, and retail investors barely participated. We expect the listing to be tepid and damaging as the current market hates high-growth tech stocks with negative earnings.

15,"Commodities market to remain focused on economic numbers, central bank comments",markets," Ravindra Rao, VP- Head of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities The general trend seen in financial markets in the last few days was exit from riskier assets like equities and commodities to the safety of cash especially the dollar. We saw a brief break from the trend this week as the dollar index came off highs and recently battered assets like commodities, Japanese yen, and US bond saw some buying interest. Equities remained volatile and Chinese equities managed to test near one-month high. The change in trading interest shows renewed search for best investment amid increasing uncertainty. Global growth worries are high as central banks look to tighten monetary policy aggressively while inflation remains at elevated levels and China continues to struggle to get virus spread under control and Russia-Ukraine fighting continues to intensify with no major efforts to restart talks. Commodities attempted to stage some recovery this week gaining support from a correction in the dollar index, improvement in China's virus situation and China's measures to support the economy. The dollar has been on a steady rise since the start of the year on the back of safe haven buying and US Fed's monetary tightening expectations and has tested the highest level since 2002. The dollar's sharp rally made it vulnerable to profit taking which materialised amid some disappointing US economic data, correction in bond yields and hawkish comments from some other central banks. US housing, regional manufacturing indices and labour market data released this week disappointed. The US 10-year bond yield corrected from 2018 high as bonds benefitted from safe haven buying. Inflation has been rising globally and this has put pressure on central banks to act. European Central Bank's monetary policy account released this week showed increased debate as to how fast and how far they should tighten policy. Meanwhile, Swiss National Bank also attracted market attention as Thomas Jordan said policy makers are ready to act against inflation. While the US dollar has come off the highs, Fed's monetary tightening stance has kept a floor to the price. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed support for monetary tightening to get inflation under control. Financial markets got a brief jolt this week as Fed chairman Jerome Powell said that they will continue with rate hikes unless there are clear signs of improvement in inflation situation. One of the biggest concerns for commodities in the last few days was increasing economic stress on the Chinese economy owing to virus related restrictions. Outlook for Chinese economy still remains bleak as economic indicators highlighted the impact of restrictions. China's industrial production, retail sales and unemployment data released earlier this week disappointed. Market nerves calmed somewhat as the virus situation improved somewhat in China's Shanghai. Shanghai officials declared the city's epidemic under control and aim to reopen broadly and allow normal life to resume from June 1. Market confidence wavered as Shanghai found first cases outside quarantine in six days, raising questions over whether plans to loosen curbs there will be impacted. Once China starts lifting virus related restrictions, economic activity may improve. However, it is likely that authorities may take a gradual approach to avoid resurgence in cases. With increasing challenge from virus spread, China has also stepped up efforts to support the economy. Amid the latest move, the People's Bank of China cut the five-year loan prime rate, which is the reference rate for mortgages, from 4.6 to 4.45 percent to boost activity in real estate. Commodities attempted some recovery this week, but there is still uncertainty if this trend can continue. The dollar is off the highs but may continue to be supported by Fed's hawkish stance. Outlook for China also remains clouded unless the virus situation comes under control. Amid continuing debate about the impact of monetary tightening, the market focus will remain on economic numbers and central bank comments.

16,More than 100 smallcaps gain 10-50% as market bounces back in volatile week,markets," After losing four percent each in previous two weeks, Indian markets bounced back gaining three percent in the highly volatile week ended May 20 despite worries over rising inflation, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling and mixed global cues. For the week, BSE Sensex added 1,532.77 points (2.90 percent) to close at 54,326.39 while the Nifty50 rose 484.05 points (3.06 percent) to end at 16,266.2. The BSE Sensex and Nifty50 recovered some of their monthly losses but were still down nearly four percent in the month of May till now. On the sectoral front, BSE Metal index surged 7.3 percent, BSE Capital Goods index added 5.3 percent and BSE FMCG, Auto and Realty indices gained four to five percent. On the other hand, Information Technology index fell two percent. The BSE Small-cap index rose four percent, Mid-cap and Large-cap indices were up three percent each. ""The Nifty had a volatile week where it witnessed sharp swings in both the directions and ultimately posted a positive weekly close. The steep decline on May 19 was arrested near the swing low of 15,735. The March low of 15,671 offered additional support on the downside. Thus the index took a strong leap on the upside on May 20,"" Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, head of technical research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. ""With this, it filled up the recently created gap area on the daily chart. Going ahead, the index is set to test the upper end of a reverse falling channel and the swing high of 16,400 which is a key barrier to watch out for. On the flip side 16,100-16,000 will act as a near term support zone,"" he added. FIIs continued selling as they offloaded equities worth of Rs 11,401.34 crore while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth of Rs 9,472.91 crore. In May so far FIIs have sold equities worth Rs 44,102.37 crore and DIIs have bought shares worth Rs 36,208.27 crore. In this week, more than 100 smallcap stocks rose 10-50 percent with the following adding 20-50 percent: Nava Bharat Ventures, Uttam Sugar Mills, Welspun Corp, Orient Bell, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Datamatics Global Services, Elgi Equipments, JK Lakshmi Cement, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores, Vikas Lifecare, Honda India Power Products, Seamec, TGV Sraac, 63 Moons Technologies, HBL Power Systems, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Grauer and Weil (India), Tilaknagar Industries, Patel Engineering Company, Easy Trip Planners, Emami Paper Mills, IRB Infrastructure Developers, and National Fertilizers.  On the other hand, Birla Tyres, Future Retail, Amber Enterprises India, Muthoot Capital Services, Dr Lal PathLabs, Asian Granito India, Metropolis Healthcare, and Brightcom Group lost 10-22 percent. ""The Nifty 50 ended the week on a positive note and both the benchmark index and the Bank Nifty recovered from last week's lows. Despite the rebound, we feel the market has not reached its bottom since price patterns on the Nifty show that the uptrend has been significantly harmed. Similarly, a Head and Shoulder breakdown has been seen on the weekly chart of the S&P 500 index,"" said Yesha Shah, head of equity research at Samco Securities. ""Having said this, a short-term rebound cannot be ruled out and at this point it is unclear if the bounce will be a relief rally or the start of a fresh bullish surge."" ""Taking all of this into account, we recommend that traders keep a cautiously bullish stance for the coming week as long as the Nifty does not break below 15,700 levels,"" he added. Among midcaps, Adani Power, JSW Energy, Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Heavy Electricals, CRISIL, Balkrishna Industries, LIC Housing Finance, PI Industries added 10-17 percent. BSE 500 index rose over three percent led by Welspun Corp, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Elgi Equipments, JK Lakshmi Cement, Ruchi Soya Industries, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Adani Power and IRB Infrastructure Developers adding over 20 percent each. ""Nifty started this week around the 15800 mark and surpassed the 16000 mark, we saw a sharp upmove in the index towards 16400 in just couple of sessions. The sharp sell-off in the global markets then lead to a huge gap down on the weekly expiry day and the market resumed its downmove to end around 15800 again,"" said Ruchit Jain, lead research, 5paisa.com. ""However, it was not done with it yet, surprisingly the index again rallied sharply on the last trading session and it ended this volatile week above 16,250 with weekly gains of over three percent. ""It was one of the most difficult week for traders as markets have oscillated sharply on both the sides. The alternate bouts of buying and selling perplexed market participants as to the primary trend of the index. ""In our view, the recent activity in the Nifty where it has taken support several times as it approached 15,700-15,800 and has faced resistance around 16400 has changed the trend from down to sideways. The index has formed a broad range of 15,700-16,400 where we can see multiple supports and ’20 DEMA’ hurdle on the higher end i.e. around 16,400,"" Jain added. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Markets have been seeing a roller-coaster ride and the key is to manage the overnight risk. Going ahead, global cues, the last leg of earnings and updates on the Russia-Ukraine war will be on the radar. We reiterate our advice to focus more on managing risk and preferring hedged bets. Manish Shah, Independent Technical Analyst: Nifty is currently far away from its 50 and 20 period moving average. Sooner or later it will revert to the mean. Minor swing high in Nifty is at 16,400. A break above 16,400 should trigger a rally to 16,650-16,700. It is likely that the Nifty may be making a significant low and a strong thrust on the upside. Next week is expiry week. If Nifty manages to break above 16,400 in the early part of the week, the monthly expiry could be around 16,650-16,700. For a weekly expiry trader, this could be a good opportunity to be on the long side of the market.

17,"Implied volatility, an integral part of option premium: Shubham Agarwal",markets," Shubham Agarwal Implied Volatility or IV as it is popularly known is mentioned a lot in discussions about Options trading. IV is one such integral part of Options that may not be as important a driving force as the price of the underlying stock/index but it is required to be understood and considered while trading Options. Let us understand what IV is first and then its impact on Option prices along with our action with respect to IV. Option Premium is calculated using 5 following factors: 5. Volatility in the Underlying First 4 factors are known to each and every one of us and there is no disagreement in its value among any of us. However, the volatility figure is a bit tricky. This is not volatility that is posted by the underlying but the volatility that is expected of the underlying during the life of the Option. We don’t need to worry about calculating it since we already know the answer i.e. Option Premium. But, with the given Option Premium and 4 known factors we can definitely find out the Volatility Implied by the Premium by back calculation. Thus, found Volatility from given Premium is called Implied Volatility. Relationship: Impact of IV is fairly straight forward with Options being priced mathematically. Higher the Premium at a point in time and at price point in the Underlying, Higher will be the IV. Higher IV >> Higher Expected Volatility This helps with the relationship again (it is which came first Egg or Chicken dilemma). Higher Expected Volatility >> Higher IV >> Higher Premium Lower Expectation of Volatility >> Lower IV >> Lower Premium This relationship is very vividly visible during the times of results. Most of us must have seen this. Right after the Result of a company (which is expected to bring unknown development) we see all Options (Calls and Puts) premiums fall. This is the reduction in Expected Volatility since the unknown is over and hence the Premiums fall. The reason for this is Fall in Expected Volatility or Fall in IV. One more thing we should keep in mind is that Rise or Constructive move is always slower than the Fall or Destructive move. Hence, when there is no event in sight, we can easily observe that Rising Market has Falling IV and Falling market has Rising IV. Actionable: Remember the relationship Rise in IV >> Rise in Premium and Vice Versa. For a market turnaround trade I should be prepared that IV may fall with a constructive move and thereby the Premium may also fall due to a fall in IV. So, I will try and trade Options in Spread, Buy a Call and Sell a Higher Strike Call while trading a market turnaround to safeguard myself from a fall in premium due to fall in IV. Similarly, I should be careful in holding on to Buy Option position when the Result is announced, because there may or may not be a movement in the underlying but there will definitely be a fall in premium due to end of the unknown event. IV also has an analytical aspect but that is a separate discussion altogether. One must know that there is a significant aspect of IV a.k.a. expected volatility that impacts Option Premium. Hope this explains what the impact is and how to provide for it. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
18,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | People’s Bank of China rides to the rescue ,markets," Dear Reader, The Fed ‘put’ may be history, but the markets consoled themselves on Friday with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) ‘put’. The PBOC cut its five-year loan prime rate, the reference rate for mortgages, by 15 basis points in an attempt to prop up its beleaguered real estate sector. It was a welcome change from the gloomy news about higher inflation and policy tightening, and stocks gave a rousing cheer. In recent weeks, estimates of Chinese growth this year have been cut, thanks to its COVID curbs. Goldman Sachs cut its forecast to 4 percent while Bloomberg Economics put it as low as 2 percent. Nobody believes the official Chinese government forecast of 5.5 percent. In April, retail sales had contracted 11.1 percent from a year ago. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had predicted Chinese real GDP growth of 4.4 percent. Going by the IMF projections, China is forecast to contribute 32.4 percent of global growth this year, while the US contributes 31 percent. Chinese growth is therefore of immense significance for global growth. In The Eastern Window, old China hand Saibal Dasgupta wrote about the impact of the China slowdown on global supply chains. Real estate is a very important driver of Chinese growth, estimated to contribute 17-29 percent to Chinese GDP, depending on how it’s measured. A report that average new home prices in 70 major cities fell in April must have rung the alarm bells for the Chinese leadership. Premier Li Keqiang has been rooting for a monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy at every meeting. Xi Jinping, whose coronation as supreme leader for life is scheduled to take place this autumn, must also be worried. But how can China afford to cut interest rates at a time when the rest of the world is tightening? Well, producer price inflation, at 8 percent in April 2022, is at its lowest level in a year, while retail inflation moved up to a still low 2.1 percent because of supply disruptions caused by the COVID curbs. Producer prices lost momentum as demand fell on the one hand, while the government took measures to increase production. For instance, my colleague Ravi Ananthanarayanan pointed out that aluminium smelters were running at full capacity by end-April and output is expected to be even higher in May. It’s another matter, of course, whether the rate cut will bail out the Chinese real estate sector. There is after all a glut of housing and it wasn’t so long ago that Xi went to town with the slogan that houses are for living in and not for speculation. For the moment, though, the markets seem to have immense faith in the ability of the Chinese Communist Party to deliver results. The bounce may also be due to pessimism in the market having reached extremes, as the survey of fund managers by Bank of America showed, setting the stage for a bear market rally. But there’s no escaping the fact that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the major central banks will have a big impact on the markets, as V Anantha Nageswaran, the Indian government’s chief economic adviser, told us in an exclusive interview. Anantha Nageswaran also said India is better placed among the emerging market economies both for portfolio and direct investments. The strength of the US dollar, though, is a problem, as this FT story, free to read for MC Pro subscribers, says. There is nowhere to hide. If China eases policy while the US tightens, the pressure on the yuan could weigh on the rupee, although it’s also true that letting the rupee depreciate may not be a bad idea. The Indian economy is in a reasonably good shape, as our Economic Recovery Tracker shows. Indian banks have had bumper profits. Among companies, with business conditions getting back to normal, Avenue Supermarts saw a good recovery in sales in March. Price hikes and exports have helped Eicher Motors. Loan growth at the bottom of the pyramid has gained momentum, as seen from Bandhan Bank’s results. With a normal monsoon expected, tractor demand is expected to be strong. With the resumption of travel, the road ahead is smooth for luggage companies. ITC’s FMCG segment has done well and the full resumption of mobility is a tailwind for its cigarettes business. Barbeque-Nation Hospitality is accelerating new restaurant openings. The situation in Russia presents a long-term opportunity for Dr Reddy’s. Tariff hikes have led to a profit surge at Bharti Airtel. But inflation remains a problem, as seen from margin pressures at several firms, including Pidilite and tyre companies. Lupin’s Q4 performance was marred by pricing erosion in the US. Godrej Consumer Products’ international business dampened the show. And, as the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee show, more rate hikes are in the offing. How the government and RBI manage inflation, says Shyam Sekhar, is “central to the stability of the stock market. If we do far better than 2012-13, then we should be able to overcome this problem”. How should investors approach the markets then? In this tumultuous environment, investors need to take stock of the drivers of volatility. This FT piece argued it’s time to hold gold and commodities. Our analyses of SBI and Tech Mahindra stressed their attractive valuations after the market correction. My colleague Madhuchanda Dey looked at bond yields versus earnings yields as a way to figure out whether it’s time to bottom-fish. This piece said that after the investing excesses of the pandemic, it’s time to go back to basics. Staying in cash is not an option, because inflation will erode the value of your savings—taking no risk is therefore the biggest risk. My colleague Sachin Pal wondered whether we are in for a repeat of the 2008 meltdown in the markets. Start-up Street considered what start-ups should do as venture capital funding ebbs. In our constant endeavour to add value and help investors navigate asset markets, we have brought you GuruSpeak—where we can learn from successful traders; Crypto Conversations—we had a story on how to buy property in the Metaverse; FX Learn, on currency trading.

19,"Shree Cement Results Preview: Profit may decline 6-8%, revenue likely to grow 10%",markets," Shree Cement is expected to declare a year on year decline of 6-8 percent in standalone profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended March on May 21. However, revenues are expected to improve 10 percent. Experts expect the cement major to register a profit of Rs 710 – 740 crore for the quarter with revenues of Rs 4,360 – 4,380 crore. Growth in revenue will be aided by higher increase in blended realisations on a yearly basis but the marginal decline in volumes and the high base of the same quarter last year will result in muted year on year growth. Sequentially the Rajasthan based company is expected to post healthy growth of 23 percent in revenue aided by higher volumes while profit is expected to grow 45 percent due to higher volumes and stable realisations partially negated by rising variable costs. Brokerage views Brokerages expect the cement volumes to decline on year due to the high base of last year. On a sequential basis though volumes are expected to show remarkable growth. “We estimate volumes of 8 million tons, a decline of 3 percent YoY and growth of 22 percent on quarter factoring strong sequential recovery due to seasonality; however, high base of Q4FY21 are expected to keep the YoY growth muted”, a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. The brokerage estimates blended realizations to increase 13 percent on year and 1 percent quarter on quarter impacted by lower exit prices of Q3FY22 and back-ended price strength in Q4FY22. Experts expect 4-5 percent sequential increase in power-fuel cost led by higher pet coke/thermal coal prices in the past six months leading to ~1-3 percent quarter on quarter increase in costs/ton during the quarter. Gross margins are expected to be impacted due to the higher variable costs compared to the same period last year. Cement EBITDA/ton (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is likely to decline 6-8 percent on year but improve by 7-9 percent on quarter to Rs 1,345 – 1,375 per ton. The sequential growth in cement EBITDA/ton is likely to be led by a combination of higher realizations and operating leverage, partially offset by higher variable costs. EBITDA margins are expected in the range of 24.8-25.4 percent for the quarter which is a decline of 450-500 bps compared to last year period but on a sequential basis, there is a likely improvement of 150-200 bps. Estimates The brokerage firm JM Financial pegs the revenues for the quarter at Rs 4,365 crore with a year on year growth of 10 percent and a sequential growth of 23 percent. PAT is likely to come in at Rs 748 crore with a 3 percent on year decline but a sequential growth of 52 percent. Axis Securities has a revenue estimate of Rs 4,385 crore at a growth of 12 percent on year and 23 percent quarter on quarter. EBITDA margins for the quarter are likely at 25.6 percent resulting in a PAT of Rs 721 crore. It expects the PAT to decline 6 percent compared to the same period last year but on a sequential basis it sees the PAT improving by 46.5 percent. As per the estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities, the revenues for the company are seen improving by 10.3 percent year on year to Rs 4,364 crore, a sequential growth of 23 percent. EBITDA margins at 24.6 percent are seen declining by 525 bps from last year quarter. However, from the previous quarter of current fiscal, the margins are likely to improve by 140 bps. It forecasts a PAT of Rs 702 crore, declining by 8.5 percent year on year but increasing by 43 percent from the previous quarter. Shree Cement ended Rs 215.15 lower at Rs 22,001.20 on May 20 at The National Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 20 percent during the past one year and is down 14 percent over the past one month.

20,Wall Street ends mixed after punishing week,markets," Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy. The S&P 500 spent most of the session in negative territory and at one point was down just over 20% from its Jan. 3 record high close before ending down 18% from that level and flat for the day. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since reaching that January high, according to a common definition. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last down about 27% from its record close in November 2021. Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla tumbled 6.4% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple Google-owner Alphabet Inc down 1.3% and Nvidia losing 2.5%. Shares of Deere & Co dropped 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. Pfizer rose 3.6%, helping the S&P 500 avoid a loss for the day. Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp and Target Inc have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers. On Friday, Ross Stores plunged 22.5% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp gained 6.1% on strong 2023 revenue outlook. Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July. The S&P 500 edged up 0.01% to end the session at 3,901.36 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.30% to 11,354.62 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03% to 31,261.90 points. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.0%, the Dow lost 2.9% and the Nasdaq declined 3.8%. About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.0 billion shares, compared with a 13.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

0,"Global markets in ""unambiguous contrarian buy territory,"" Bank of America says",markets," The trillions wiped off global markets in recent weeks has triggered a contrarian 'buy' signal from BofA's closely-followed 'Bull & Bear' sentiment indicator, while emerging markets are seeing their toughest time since the peak of the COVID crash. Fears that inflation and fast-rising rates will send major economies into recession have sent global markets in a downward spiral with global equities losing close to 18% since the beginning of the year. It is the worst start to a year on recent record. BofA's analysts said their 'Bull & Bear' indicator had now moved into ""unambiguous contrarian buy territory"", given the huge redemptions in developed market stocks, riskier high-yield debt and emerging market bonds. The week saw the largest ouflows from emerging markets debt since March 2020 and the biggest withdrawals from high yield bonds in 14 weeks, at $6.1 billion and $4.3 billion respectively BofA noted, citing EPFR data. Across the equity space, Europe, which is being hit hardest by the Russia-Ukraine war, suffered a fourteenth week of withdrawals.

1,Russia to lift short-selling ban from June 1,markets," Russia's central bank will from June 1 lift a ban on short selling of securities and on buying of foreign currencies using credit leveraging, in moves to increase market liquidity as volatility has subsided, it said on Friday. Russia restricted trading in Russian assets in March, saying it wanted to protect investors' rights and ensure decisions were not driven by political pressure, after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. The short-selling ban led to a drop in turnover on the Moscow Exchange to 88 trillion roubles ($1.49 trillion) in April from 95.7 trillion roubles in the same month of 2021, data showed on Friday. The central bank said it would still limit the size of credit leveraging that a brokerage can offer its clients until the end of this year. The rouble has rallied to its strongest levels in years against the euro and dollar, which analysts attributed to EU countries preparing to pay Russia for gas and to capital controls imposed by Moscow. Russia is expected to ease those controls further. The central bank has said a ban on the sale of securities by non-residents helped to avoid extreme market volatility that could have caused mass defaults through a domino effect.

2,"As bear market looms, battered Wall Street seeks elusive 'Fed put'",markets," The Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates until it squashes the highest inflation in decades is darkening the outlook across Wall Street, as U.S. stocks stand on the cusp of a bear market and warnings of a recession grow louder. At issue is the so-called Fed put, or investors’ belief that the Fed will take action if stocks fall too deeply, even though it has no mandate to maintain asset prices. One oft-cited example of the phenomenon, which is named after a hedging derivative used to protect against market falls, occurred when the Fed halted a rate hiking cycle in early 2019 after a stock market tantrum. Also Read: Global stocks rebound despite unease over economy; dollar gains This time around, the Fed’s insistence that it will raise rates as high as needed to tame surging inflation has bolstered the argument that policymakers will be less sensitive to market volatility - threatening more pain for investors. read more A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers now expect the Fed to step in at 3,529 on the S&P 500, compared with expectations of 3,700 in February. Such a drop would constitute a 26% decline from the S&P’s Jan. 3 closing high. The index, which closed Friday at 3,901.36, is already down almost 19% from that high this year on an intraday basis - close to the 20% decline that would confirm a bear market, according to some definitions. ""The Fed has bigger fish to fry and that's the inflation problem,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes, who is increasing his cash levels. ""The 'Fed put' is kaput until the central bank is confident that they're no longer behind the curve."" As a result, some investors are digging in for a long slog. BofA’s survey showed cash allocations at a two-decade high, while bets against technology stocks stand at their highest since 2006. Strategists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, earlier this week published a “Recession manual for US equities” in response to client inquiries on how stocks will perform in a downturn. Barclays analysts said that numerous negative near-term catalysts mean the risks for stocks “remain firmly stacked to the downside."" The S&P 500 closed broadly unchanged on Friday, reversing a sharp intraday decline that had briefly put it into bear market territory. The index marked its seventh straight week of losses, the longest streak since 2001. Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, believes the index needs to fall at least another 15% for the Fed to slow its tightening, given that unprecedented monetary policy support helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows. ""The Fed is being very clear that there will be some pain ahead,"" he said. The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points and is expected to tighten monetary policy by 193 basis points this year. Investors will get more insight into the central bank's thinking when minutes from its last meeting are released on May 25. Some worry the Fed risks exacerbating volatility if it does not heed possible danger signs from asset prices. Analysts at the Institute of International Finance said stocks may be subject to the same type of selling that rocked markets in late 2018, when many investors believed the Fed tightened monetary policy too far. “In the past, rising uncertainty and mounting recession risk have had important effects on investor psychology, making markets less tolerant of monetary policy tightening that is seen as no longer warranted,” IIF analysts wrote on Thursday. “The risk of a similar market tantrum (to 2018) is rising again now as markets fret about global recession.” There have been signs of resilient sentiment among investors. For example, the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is elevated but below levels it reached during previous major selloffs. read more And the ARK Innovation Fund ARKK.K, which became emblematic of the pandemic rally, has brought in net positive inflows of $977 million over the last six weeks, Lipper data showed. The fund is down 57% in 2022. While some investors say those are signals that markets are yet to bottom, others are more hopeful. read more Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Zuma Wealth, believes some investors are re-entering parts of the stock market that have suffered outsized losses. ""The Fed is already seeing signs that they won't be needed as a buyer of last resort,"" she said. Analysts at Deutsche Bank are less optimistic.

3,Global stocks rebound despite unease over economy; dollar gains,markets," Global equity markets rebounded after the S&P 500 pared losses that briefly took it into bear market territory, and the dollar gained on Friday, as investor unease about Federal Reserve policy tightening to curb inflation kindled fears of a recession. Shares rebounded earlier in Europe and Asia after China cut a key lending benchmark to bolster its weakening economy, helping initially to drive gains on Wall Street. China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. Also Read: Indian markets should be moving upwards next week, says IIFL’s Sanjiv Bhasin While a late-day rally stopped the S&P 500 from confirming a bear market, the gloom on Wall Street led the benchmark to fall for the seventh consecutive week, an event that has occurred only five times since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How long the downdraft in equities lasts will depend on when inflation breaks, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly,"" Tuz said, referring to poor earnings results at Walmart Inc and Target Corp. Also Read: Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy The S&P 500 closed up 0.01% after being down 2.27% at one point or below the level would confirm a bear market – a 20% decline from its Jan. 3 record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite, already in bear territory, fell 0.3%. Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes. ""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Auth said. ""You’re seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it’s just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added. MSCI’s gauge of stocks in 47 countries closed up 0.37%, but still fell for the seventh consecutive week, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.73%. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 6.5 basis points to 2.790%. Fed funds futures were firmer, suggesting that the U.S. rates market has pulled back a bit from some of its more extreme rate hike estimates. The rates market has priced in a fed funds rate of 2.783% at the end of next year, compared with the current level of 0.83%. It was as high as 2.9% two weeks ago. The day’s gains for the dollar were not enough to erase sharp losses from earlier this week that pulled the greenback away from a five-year high against the common currency, on worries its months-long rally may have been overdone. The dollar has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety amid a rout across markets due to fears of soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed and the war in Ukraine. The dollar index rose 0.146%, with the euro down 0.3% at $1.0554. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09% to 127.92 per dollar. Euro zone bond yields were higher after two days of hefty falls as risk sentiment improved following China’s rate cut. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield rose 0.1 basis point to 0.9450%, below last week’s eight-year high of 1.189%. Markets are pricing in 38 basis points of tightening from the European Central Bank by its July meeting. This suggests a 25 basis-point hike is fully priced in and markets see around a 50/50 chance of an additional 25 basis-point move. Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth will hurt demand. U.S. crude futures settled $1.02 higher at $113.23 and Brent rose 51 cents to settle at $112.55 a barrel. Gold edged up, heading for its first week of gains in five weeks on persistent worries over economic growth and the dollar’s decline over the week. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,842.10. Bitcoin fell 3.36% to $29,272.33. World stocks plunge $13 trillion in value . Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
4,"S&P 500 on pace to confirm bear market, falls 20% from record close",markets," The benchmark S&P 500 index is trading down 20% from its Jan. 3 record close in volatile trading on Friday, as investors fretted over the impact of rising inflation on earnings and the fallout of interest rate hikes on economic growth. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is already in a bear market, down 30.7% from its record close in November 2021. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary and industrials down 3.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Apple Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Nvidia Corp and Tesla slid between 2.5% and 9.9%, weighing the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Both the indexes had climbed above 1% in morning trading. Shares of Deere & Co tumbled 12.1% and were the biggest drag on the industrial sector after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more ""In this process of a bear market, it is very common to have these intraday swings and counter cyclical rallies in it,"" said Will Nasgovitz, chief executive officer at Heartland Advisors. ""We are going to probably see a bear market (in S&P 500). The market is reflecting that the economy is not standing extremely tall, there are some cracks in the foundation."" Disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart Inc and Target Inc rattled market sentiment this week, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression. The three major indexes are down between 15.1% and 28.6% so far this year as investors adjust to supply-chain snarls, lockdowns in China, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the Ukraine conflict and the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates. Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July. At 12:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 439.27 points, or 1.41%, at 30,813.86, the S&P 500 was down 69.83 points, or 1.79%, at 3,830.96, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 291.39 points, or 2.56%, at 11,097.11. Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session. Ross Stores plunged 23.8% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp gained 3% on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

7,"Technical View | Nifty forms bullish candle; support at 16,000-15,800",markets," The Nifty recovered sharply on May 20 from the selloff in the previous session, ending near the day's high. The index finished at 16,266.20, up 456.80 points, or 2.89 percent, helped by buying across the sectors, forming a bullish candle. The Nifty has to hold above 16,161 to extend the bounce towards 16,400 and 16,666, while on the downside, support exists at 16,000 and 15,800 zones, experts said. ""With this recovery, the index also bridged the bearish gap registered in the last session, present between 15,984 and 16, 211,"" said Mazhar Mohammad, Founder & Chief Market Strategist, Chartviewindia.in, said. ""Friday’s strong move can also be interpreted to conclude that the fall of the last Thursday’s session was just a reaction to the negative global cues, provided the Nifty witnesses a follow-through buying in the next trading session. In that scenario, the initial hurdle shall be around 16,400 levels and beyond that test of 20-day SMA cannot be ruled out."" It is critical that the index to sustain above 16,000, below which weakness can be expected with initial target of 15,775. Considering the erratic moves of the last couple of trading, it would be prudent to remain neutral on the index trade, he said. The options data suggests a trading range between 15,800 and 16,500.

9,"Taking Stock | Market bounces back; Sensex, Nifty gain 3%; metal, pharma, banks lead charge",markets," The Indian benchmark made a smart recovery from the previous day’s battering, recouping the losses and ended nearly 3 percent higher supported by strong global cues and buying across the sectors. At close, the Sensex was up 1,534.16 points, or 2.91 percent, at 54,326.39, and the Nifty was up 456.80 points, or 2.89 percent, at 16,266.20. Asian markets opened high after China cut the five-year loan prime rate to 4.45 percent from 4.6 percent to bolster growth, amid indications that the Covid situation had begun to ease in the financial hub of Shanghai. ""The market displayed a confident yet calm rally throughout the day, supported by fortified global markets, especially the Asian market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. A positive start for Asian peers saw Indian shares open higher and the indices extended the gains as the day progressed, finishing a tad below intraday highs. The Sensex and the Nifty touched highs of 54,396.43 and 16,283.05 during the day. For the week, BSE Sensex rose 1,532.77 points, or 2.90 percent, and the Nifty added 484.05 points, or 3.06 percent. Investors got richer by Rs 4,92,349.47 crore, as the market capitalisation of BSE listed companies rose to Rs 2,54,11,537.52 crore on May 20 from Rs 2,49,19,188.05 crore the previous day. ""The Chinese central bank cut a key interest rate to support growth, injecting optimism into emerging markets,"" Nair said. With concerns about slowdown and rate hikes across the globe, investors will continue to move with caution. Value stocks should do well during this consolidation period, he said. Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Reliance Industries, JSW Steel, Nestle India and Tata Motors were among the top Nifty gainers, while losers included Shree Cements and UPL. All the sectoral indices ended in the green. Nifty bank, metal, pharma, PSU bank, FMCG, auto and energy indices were up 2-4 percent. Also Read: Nilesh Shah lists three reasons for FII selloff Stocks and sectors On the BSE, metal, healthcare, capital goods, and realty indices rose 3-4 percent each.

A long build-up was seen in BHEL, Sun TV and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, while a short build-up was witnessed in Container Corporation, PI Industries and Godrej Consumer Products. Welspun Corp, ITC and Hindustan Aeronautics were among the stocks that touched their 52-week high on the BSE. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 200 percent was seen in Zydus Lifesciences, Container Corporation and Godrej Consumer Products.

However, following global cues, the Indian equity markets witnessed large volatility. The metal sector rebounded sharply after a steep correction in recent weeks. BSE IT index was down in an otherwise positive market this week. FIIs continued their selling in India. Markets remained wary of global growth-inflation expectations. With the result season entering the last leg, the focus will be more on the macro data points. Monetary policy tightening action by central banks globally amid high inflation will continue to weigh on market sentiments. Prashanth Tapse, Vice President (Research), Mehta Equities Led by Reliance Industries and Tata Motors, bulls came back with vengeance, primarily buoyed by a fall in the US treasury bond yields and the US dollar Index. Another positive takeaway was the all-round buying—from FMCG, IT to metal stocks. Interestingly, the gains came despite the overnight fall in Wall Street amid fears of inflation and waning hopes for the US and global economic recovery. The technical picture has shifted to neutral and positive following the aggressive spike during the day, with all bullish eyes on the Nifty’s biggest hurdles at the 16,411 mark. Expect a waterfall of selling only below the 15,951 mark. Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President-Technical Research, Kotak Securities The Market did a U-turn from the previous day’s slump, as bargain hunting following the recent crash and recovery in other Asian indices bolstered the sentiment at home. China's central bank cutting the five-year loan prime rate and easing of Covid restrictions also provided a major leg-up to the market. Technically, after a sharp price correction, the Nifty eventually took the support near 15,750 and bounced back sharply. On the daily chart, the index formed a double bottom formation and, on the weekly charts, after a long time, it formed a long bullish candle, indicating a further uptrend. On the weekly charts, the Nifty reclaimed 16,000 and is comfortably trading above the 10-day simple moving average (SMA). The reversal formation is likely to continue if the index succeeds to trade above 16,000 and above it, it can move up to 16,400. The upside may continue and lift the index to 16,550. However, below 16,000, the upside would be vulnerable and the index could slip to 15,800-15,700.

10,"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | GST: A simple, reliable tax still a distant dream?",markets," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The Goods and Services Tax is widely acknowledged as one of the most important reforms implemented in India in the past decade. However, almost five years since it was first introduced, the dream of a simple and reliable tax structure still seems far away. What’s added to the muddle now is the Supreme Court ruling on a case which among other things made the point that the recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the states and the central government. Now, that might seem to be just a reiteration of what’s already there in the law. Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said as much after the apex court judgment. On the other hand, critics of the tax (or the way the tax has been implemented) say the order restores the power of the states. Finance ministers of states ruled by non-BJP parties have also welcomed the judgment and said it will boost cooperative federalism. Where the Supreme Court judgment acquires significance is in the way the recommendations of the GST Council are implemented. So far, even if the states have had differences, they have stuck to the recommendations of the Council. Now, some states may well be emboldened to step out of line since the recommendations are not binding. This threatens the concept of ‘one nation, one tax’, the most attractive selling point of GST that replaced a complicated indirect tax structure with multiple levies. The ruling also comes at a particularly delicate time. The compensation cess arrangement — wherein states are compensated by the Centre for revenue shortfall —is coming to an end this year. This increases the scope for further friction between the Centre and states. To be sure, in a huge federal democracy like India, there will always be teething troubles for complex laws, especially those involving revenue sharing. But the apex court ruling should act as a trigger for the Centre and states to come together and work as one, not only to increase revenues, but also stop a potential flood of litigation that can act as a drag on the nascent economic recovery. A recovery in GST revenues in recent months is a welcome trend and the two can work together to build it up further.

11,Moneycontrol Market Sentiment Survey | Fund managers see scope for up to 15% further fall in Indian equities,markets," Majority of domestic asset managers see scope for up to 15 percent further fall in benchmark – Nifty 50 and BSE-Sensex – from current levels amid macroeconomic volatility and tightening global monetary policy, according to the latest edition of Moneycontrol’s Market Sentiment Survey. The survey saw participation from 11 fund managers managing assets worth Rs 10 lakh crore. Domestic stock indices have already corrected more than 11 percent from their record highs hit in October 2021 but have outperformed other major markets like the US, China and the European Union in that period. If the worst-case scenario of 15 percent correction from the current level of the Nifty 50 played out, the index would stand below the 14,000 points mark giving up more than 25 percent from the record highs.   That said, one in three fund managers polled expected a rebound rally in the market after months of consolidation in a 3,000-point range. In terms strategy, four in five fund managers said that they will buy every dip in the market reflecting their optimism for long-term returns and overall economic growth.  The optimism of fund managers of strong long-term returns in the market stems from their expectation of Nifty 50 earnings rising 10-15 percent in 2022-23. More than 90 percent of the respondents saw 10-15 percent growth in earnings as compared to 75 percent in the April survey.  Given the volatility, banks and fast-moving consumer goods companies emerged as the top choice of surveyed fund managers for seeking refuge from the ongoing market volatility. Those two sectors were followed by information technology and automobiles. In terms of taking a contrarian bet in the market, 54.5 percent of the participating fund managers recommended going overweight on automobile companies’ stocks while 27.3 percent suggested going underweight on commodity producers.  On the macroeconomic front, two in three fund managers expected the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee to raise interest rates by another 100-125 basis points that will leave the repo rate at 5.4-5.65 percent. Earlier this month, the MPC raised the interest rate by 40 basis points following an emergency inter-policy meeting.

13,"Take Five: Surging inflation, recession risk and tanking markets",markets," Central banks are wrestling with inflation and sliding stocks are feeling the heat, leaving investors to ponder just where the so-called ""Fed put"" has gone. Meeting minutes from the world's foremost policymakers may shed some light, while New Zealand and South Korean central banks ponder how big their rate hikes need to be to keep up with the Fed. And Washington holds the key to a Russian sovereign default as a key deadline approaches. Here's your look at the week ahead from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee, and Karin Strohecker in London. 1/ FED THINKING Can the Federal Reserve tame the worst U.S. inflation in decades without dragging the economy into a recession? The bank's meeting minutes on May 25 will offer clues. Chair Jerome Powell is confident the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing"" — words that are little solace to equity markets as recession warnings from big Wall Street banks pile up. Having raised rates by 75 basis points since March, the Fed is expected to hike another 50 bps in July. Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to tame inflation. The minutes will show how tenacious policy makers expect inflation to be and whether growth is resilient enough to face much tighter monetary policy. 2/ A BEAR HUG Wall Street is melting. Major stock market indexes are in the grip of bear market territory with S&P 500 down some 19%, the high flying Nasdaq has lost more than a quarter from a November 2021 peak. And there's no respite in sight: Barclays and Goldman predict further pain for equities as corporate margins suffer from surging inflation. The selloff is widespread. Since the bond bull market peak in March 2020, a constant duration 30-year U.S. Treasury bond lost half its value, and safe-haven gold is down 6% this quarter. Surging volatility means even hardened stock pickers are reluctant to take big bets. Retail and institutional investors are also bearish. A U.S. retail investment sentiment index is close to a March 2009 low while fund managers are running their highest cash levels since September 2011. 3/ PIVOT POINT Forward-looking Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan, and euro area is worth paying attention to. And more so than usual with central banks caught between surging inflation and its impact on consumers amid a darkening growth outlook, hurt by China's COVID-lockdowns and war in Ukraine. China bounced back quickly from an initial 2020 pandemic slump thanks to bumper exports and factory production, but the current downturn could be harder to shake off. Entrenched in their inflation fight, policymakers may reach a pivot point in the coming months where they have little choice but to focus on recession risk. PMIs have held up well recently, but might show how close that turning point is. 4/ EARLY MOVERS CATCHING UP They were early movers, but the race is on for central banks in New Zealand and Korea to stay ahead of a Fed hot on their heels with some big-step hikes. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely seen raising rates by a half-point again on Wednesday to tame inflation, though risks to the economy are rising with recent homebuyers feeling the pain of higher mortgage rates. Korea's new central bank governor roiled markets by flagging a half-point increase before his maiden meeting on Thursday. Falling behind the curve could squeeze the fragile won, sending imported food and energy prices soaring. One of the few remaining holdouts, Bank Indonesia, is tipped to stay put a little longer when meeting on Tuesday. 5/ RUSSIA FACES DEFAULT, AGAIN The prospect of a Russian sovereign default is back given a deadline for a U.S. license allowing Moscow to make payments expiring on May 25 and $100 million in interest payments due a couple of days after. Russia's $40 billion of sovereign bonds are just one of the flashpoints after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow. Also pressing is whether gas will keep flowing to Europe as firms struggle to confirm how they can legally buy gas if they have to pay in roubles with payments due from May 20. The EU has advised companies against opening rouble accounts but stopped short of saying that this would breach its sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas.

14,"Exclusive Interview: Blackstone Real Estate bullish on India, sees office rentals firming up",markets," Blackstone Real Estate is the largest office space owner in India with a commercial real estate portfolio valued at $20 billion. Kenneth Caplan, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, and Tuhin Parikh, head of real estate at Blackstone India, told Nisha Poddar that they are bullish on India investments and see an all around recovery in office rentals, malls and logistics to pre-COVID levels. Excerpts from an exclusive conversation. Caplan: From a macro standpoint, we are in this uncertain time, with a more challenging environment, and we have COVID still creating disruptions. We have geopolitical conflicts happening, with rising inflation and rising interest rates and that is creating a more challenging backdrop and challenging environment. In terms of what is driving that, we have demand that is increasing. I am based in New York and in the US we are seeing economy reopening, a tight job market, a lot of fiscal stimulus that is stimulating a lot more demand than supply can keep up with and that’s triggering inflation. With higher inflation we are seeing higher interest rates and with higher interest rates we are seeing the US Fed trying to tamp that down and that’s creating an environment where people are questioning how much of that tightening do you have and what does that mean for growth. Generally we are seeing slowing growth in parts of the US, slowing growth in parts of Europe obviously again with the Ukraine situation and slowing growth in other parts of the world as well, but here in India we are seeing greater growth. You are seeing higher inflation and some higher interest rates but you are also seeing higher level of growth which is actually really encouraging and positive. Tuhin, here in India you are the largest owner of office space, how is that shaping up at the moment given the new change in the macro environment. Being a $20 billion portfolio manager, what are you looking at? Tuhin Parikh: As Kenneth mentioned we are highly thematic investors, so we invest in what are long-term trends -- so in office, the trend that we are investing in is the fact that the growth of the ITs and offshoring business outsourcing in India has accelerated during Covid. We had work from home issues but hiring places doubled in India in the past couple of years -- that’s an extremely good underpinning of the fundamentals or office business and we are seeing that now as people are coming back to office, demand for offices is actually quite strong and we are seeing that recovery across the entire portfolio in office; retail world recovery has been the strongest so far. People are going out to shop, to consume, to see movies, malls are performing much better than they were at their 2019 peak. Newest portfolio, of which we are the largest owners, warehousing, where the e-commerce tailwinds and GST uniformalisation of the Indian economy are really propelling new tenants to come in and take up space. Now there’s a hybrid model but the vacancies it seems have been dropping, so how are the rental prices stacking up Parikh: When Covid hit obviously, the world came to a standstill -- people didn’t know what was happening at that point in time. There was a high level of uncertainty, whether people would come back to office or what would happen. I think two trends have come out, people may want more flexibility in their work-life, the fact that office is a centre of your work-life has also become a reality -- office being a part of people’s lives is not going away. Given rental pressures, inflation is increasing the cost of producing the same assets and the interest rate is reducing the amount of development people can do, therefore we actually see rentals firming in India because replacement costs are going up. The same office building takes 20-30 percent more to develop than it took 2-3 years ago, that’s pretty good fundamentals for existing stuff that we own. Which are the new areas you are focusing on for more investment? Caplan: Hotels are an area we have been investing in since the beginning of our existence, we have been investing in real estate for 30 years. It is what we have done from the beginning, we actually have a number of hotel investments here in India -- it is an area we are globally very enthusiastic about and that would include India. Data centres as well, frankly. In data centres we bought a company called QTS in the US last year and it had great initial success, not only the portfolio but also growing that business and we look for similar opportunities here in India. And we are studying other areas to grow as well. Those are two good examples and again that’s partly why I am here and we are constantly looking at where are those opportunities, where are those strong tailwinds. The good neighbourhoods are where we wanna invest. How is India placed when it comes to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) compliance especially in portfolio companies?

16,eMudhra IPO opened today: Should you subscribe?,markets," eMudhra Ltd  is a licensed certifying authority that issues digital certificates to individuals and institutions for ITR filings, banking transactions and the like. The company was incorporated on June 16, 2008, as a wholly owned subsidiary of 3i Infotech Ltd, and it enjoyed a market share of 37.9 percent in the digital signature certificates segment in FY21. In FY20, it was 36.5 percent. The company, which works closely with large government and banking customers, including more than 20 public and private sector banks and state governments, has launched its maiden public offering today (May 20). The subscription period will close on May 24 (Tuesday). Features of the offer The company intends to garner Rs 413 crore through the IPO. Of this, there will be a fresh issue of equity shares to the tune of Rs 161 crore. An offer for sale (OFS) of 9,835,394 equity shares will be worth Rs 252 crore. Post the issue, the promoter shareholding will fall 18.16 percent -- to 61.03 percent from 79.19 percent. The price band has been fixed between Rs 243 and 256 per equity share, with a face value Rs 5 each. Of the total offer size, 50 percent of the net offer will be reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), 35 percent for retail investors, and the remaining 15 percent for non-institutional investors. Brokerage recommendations Brokerages recommend investors to exercise caution while subscribing to the issue. They say only those investors who have a high risk appetite should go for the issue. The company has its inherent strength of being the largest licensed certifying authority in India. It is a one-stop shop solution provider in secure digital transformation, and it has a diverse, long-standing and growing customer base. It has partnerships with leading Indian and global channel partners and enterprise solution partners. But there are concerns about the prospects of the company. According to a report from Angel One, the company’s success will be largely dependent on its ability to anticipate, adapt and respond effectively to the technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing regulations as well as R&D. It is highly dependent on technology and operates in a highly competitive industry. The brokerage says the scale of operation for the company is relatively modest and the digital security and paperless transformation market is highly competitive. “At the upper end of the price band, the post-issue FY22 annualised P/E works out to 49.0x, which, we believe, is factoring in the positives,” it said. However, taking into account the concerns highlighted earlier, it recommended a ‘neutral’ rating. COVID-19 has forced organisations to adopt digital solutions like digital identity, security and paperless transformation solutions faster. “We feel that this trend will continue and players like eMudhra, which is a one-stop shop player in secure digital transformation, is expected to benefit from the growth in the addressable market,” said a report from Choice Broking. While highlighting the concerns related to the company, it said that the company is prone to risks due to, “unfavourable government policies and regulations, difficulty in adapting to the rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, and difficulty in expanding international operations and rise in competition”. Since there are no listed peers with a similar business, peer comparison is not feasible. “At the upper price band of Rs 256, the company is demanding a P/E multiple of 114.5x (to its FY21 earnings of Rs 2.2 per share), which seems to be high,” the report said. “Annualising the 9MFY22 performance, the demanded P/E multiple comes out to be 49x and considering the current turbulence in the global equity market, we assign a ‘subscribe with caution’ rating for the issue,” the report said. Brokerage firm Arihant Capital Markets recommends that only investors with high-risk appetite can ‘subscribe’ to the IPO. “At the upper price band, the issue has been offered at a P/E of 44x to its FY22E annualised EPS of Rs 5.8 (9MFY22 EPS was INR 4.4)”, it said. That said, eMudhra reported revenue from operations of Rs 131.59 crore for FY21 -- up 13 percent from Rs 116.45 crore in FY20. For the nine months ended December 2021, the company clocked Rs 137.24 crore in revenues. The company has consistently achieved a double-digit growth in profit after tax (PAT) since FY19. It recorded a PAT of Rs 18.4 crore in FY20. This jumped 38 percent to Rs 25.36 crore in FY21. Profit for the nine months ended December 2021 was at Rs 303.34 crore. Looking after the decent financial performance of the company and the unique business model, Hem Securities recommended a ‘subscribe’.

17,"Sensex, Nifty up 2.5% each as China cuts key lending rates, FM foresees 8.9% GDP growth for FY23",markets," The Indian stock market recouped the previous day’s losses and was almost 2.5 percent higher around noon on May 20 on strong global cues after China cut key lending rates. At 11.49 am, the Sensex was up 1,305.79 points, or 2.47 percent, at 54,098.02, and the Nifty was trading 396.40 points, or 2.51 percent, higher at 16,205.80. All sectoral indices were in the green, with auto, financials, capital goods, FMCG, healthcare, metals and realty indices adding 2-3 percent each. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices are up over a percent each. Here are the factors pushing the market higher: 1 China cuts key lending rates China cut its five-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 15 basis points on May 20, a sharper cut than expected, as authorities seek to cushion an economic slowdown, though it left the one-year LPR unchanged. The five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages. Senior officials have pledged further measures to fight a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy, hit by COVID-19 outbreaks that prompted stringent measures and mobility restrictions and causing huge disruptions to activity, according to Reuters. The Chinese central bank has pledged to step up support for the slowing economy but analysts say the room to ease policy could be limited by worries about capital outflows, as the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Catch all the market action on our live blog 2 Strong Asian markets Asian markets were trading on a robust note as China cut key lending rates to stimulate the economy. Among the Asian names, Hang Seng added over 2 percent followed by Kospi, Nikkei and Sanghai adding over a percent each. SGX Nifty was trading at 16,177 level, up 392 points or 2.48 percent at 11.21 am. Also read: Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy 3 FM signals speedy recovery, projects 8.9% GDP growth India's economic growth is likely to be robust at 8.9 percent in the current financial year, reflecting the country's strong resilience and speedy recovery, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said. She also expressed confidence that India will continue to achieve a high growth rate in the next financial year as well, the finance ministry said in a statement. The finance minister said India's economic growth in the current financial year has been robust and is estimated to be 8.9 percent, the highest among all large economies. 4 All sectors in the green All sectoral indices are trading in the green, with auto, financials, healthcare, realty, metals, oil & gas and capital goods indices adding 2 percent each. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices traded higher by over a percent each. RIL, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the top positive contributors, while Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS and ITC were the most active stocks. About 2394 shares advanced, 598 declined, and 115 shares remained unchanged. Technical views VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services The excessive volatility in the market is broadly due to two reasons. Te market has discounted severe monetary tightening by the US central bank, which is likely to take the Fed funds rate to around 3 percent in 2023. It has not fully discounted the probability of the US economy slipping into recession in 2023. Till there is clarity on the second issue, the “risk-off, risk-on mode” in the market is likely to continue in the near term. It may take a few weeks for the markets to stabilise. It is important to appreciate the fact that the dominant feature of this market is bearish in the short term. Nasdaq is 30 percent down from the peak and S&P 500 is trading 19 percent lower from its highs. These are reflections of weakness in the market. FIIs are likely to continue selling since India is the only emerging market where they are sitting on good profits and the market provides the liquidity to sell. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel One The opening was painful on May 19 as the Nifty started 300 points lower on massive overnight selloff in US bourses. It caught a lot of momentum traders on the wrong foot who had carried over their longs after a sharp rebound the previous day. But fortunately, there was no major damage seen during the day as compared to the global screen. Eventually, the tragic weekly expiry day ended with over two and half a percent cut to the previous close. At this juncture, it’s better to take one step at a time. As far as levels are concerned, 16,000–16,100 once again become a sturdy wall and till the time, it does not get surpassed, we are likely to see selling pressure at higher levels.

19,Metal stocks rally as China cuts key lending rates to stimulate economy,markets," Domestic commodity producers soared on May 20 after the world’s largest commodity consumer China cut its key lending rates by a record quantum to stimulate the economy ravaged by the latest outbreak of the COVID-19 and reemergence of lockdowns. Shares of domestic producers such as JSW Steel, Hindustan Copper, Tata Steel, Vedanta, National Aluminum Company, SAIL, and Hindalco Industries soared 2-7 percent in the morning trade. Futures of several metals in China soared 3-10 percent earlier in the day on expectations of more stimulus for the construction sector that will boost consumption of commodities. Follow our live blog for the latest on the market China's surprise rate cut forced traders to cover the short positions in several metal companies' stocks due to overall concerns over global growth. Indian producers will benefit from the surge in international prices of commodities, which is likely to feed into domestic prices. In recent weeks, domestic metal prices have softened following a steep correction in global commodities on fears of demand slowdown led by China. Indian companies will also benefit from higher exports to China as and when demand picks up in that country, analysts said. Indian companies have ramped up exports over the past two years as domestic volume growth remained muted.

These sources say the regulator has been using its database to spot front running based on synchronized movement in prices of stocks purchased by funds, on the day of purchase. The regulator had been alerted to such bad apples by market participants on various occasions. The big problem was to first spot the front running and then prove it. For the past few months, SEBI has been using artificial intelligence on its data trove to identify such synchronized stock moves on the days of purchase of stocks by funds.
