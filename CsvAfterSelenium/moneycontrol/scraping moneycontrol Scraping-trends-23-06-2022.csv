Sofia, who is safe in Rome now, was in a hospital for three months trying to heal from her trauma--physical and mental, shared a Ukrainian volunteer and Sofia's sister on social media. A post shared by ALINA | РОЗМОВНА АНГЛІЙСЬКА (@alenglish_) A post shared by ALINA | РОЗМОВНА АНГЛІЙСЬКА (@alenglish_)  Before the Russian invasion, Sofia loved playing equestrian sport, but now she's not sure if she can do it with one arm, her sister Alina shared on Instagram. The family is hopeful that if Sofia gets a prosthetic limb, her pain will subside. It will also allow her to get back to normal routine and even dress herself. The family found a clinic in the US that can make her a prothetic arm but it's expensive. ""The clinic has no funding. We need sponsors because the cost runs into tens of thousands of dollars,"" Alina said, requesting Ukranian and foreign companies and celebrities to help them.

1,The road not (to be) taken: This National Highway in Bihar is an obstacle course to disaster,trends," The sorry state of a National Highway in Bihar has made the headlines. A stretch of the National Highway 227, which passes through Bihar's Madhubani, is riddle with gigantic craters as far as the eye can see – to the point where it is difficult to find the road among the potholes. The highway looks like a series of huge swimming pools in an aerial video filmed by Praveen Thakur of Dainik Bhaskar newspaper. According to the Dainik Bhaskar report, the biggest pothole on the National Highway is a staggering 100-feet wide and three-feet deep. माननीय @nitin_gadkari @NitishKumar @NHAI_Official ये एनएच 227 L है। कितना गजब का नजारा है। सड़क दिख नही रही गड्ढे अवश्य दिख रहे छोटे तालाब के शक्ल में। गजब #बिहार की अजब गाथा। क्यों संवेदक फरार हो जाता है।? क्या आप ठोस कार्रवाई नही कर सकते हैं ? pic.twitter.com/zEoL2bWEGO The contractor responsible for building the road is currently absconding. Locals accused politicians and local leaders of indifference, saying that the Bihar government has ignored repeated pleas to repair the highway and it is affecting business. Political strategist Prashant Kishor, a vocal critic of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, slammed the state’s government and the chief minister over the condition of NH 227. “Recently, Nitish Kumar ji was telling employees of the road construction department at an event that they should tell everyone about the good condition of roads in Bihar,"" he tweeted in Hindi. 90 के दशक के जंगलराज में बिहार में सड़कों की स्थिति की याद दिलाता यह बिहार के मधुबनी जिले का नेशनल हाईवे 227 (L) है। अभी हाल में ही #Nitishkumar जी एक कार्यक्रम में पथ निर्माण विभाग के लोगों को बोल रहे थे कि बिहार में सड़कों की अच्छी स्थिति के बारे में उन्हें सबको बताना चाहिए। pic.twitter.com/Qp0ehEluty  Meanwhile, locals spoke of how the state of the road has adversely affected their business. Hardware trader Himmat Lal Raut told Dainik Bhaskar that drivers who bring goods from outside often refuse to drive on the battered road, citing the number of potholes it has."
2,"Meet Kanika Tekriwal, the ‘small town girl’ who owns 10 private jets",trends," On Instagram, Kanika Tekriwal describes herself as a “small town girl” with massive dreams. In reality, she is so much more. At the age of 22, Kanika Tekriwal set up her own aviation-based startup after defying cancer, parental opposition and casual sexism. A decade later, this high-flying entrepreneur owns 10 private jets. Her company JetSetGo -- India's first and only marketplace for private jet and helicopter charters – has been credited for transforming the charter plane sector in India. “I had the idea brewing in my head for close to three years or so, but when I took out my sketch board and started working on it, I was diagnosed with cancer, which set me back by a year,” Kanika Tekriwal told Indiatimes. “Luckily for me, nobody else in the country had gotten around to doing something similar until I finished treatment or until now.” The journey was not an easy one for Tekriwal, who was born in a traditional Marwari family where women were not encouraged to work. But Tekriwal was passionate about her mission of making private flying more accessible and economical, and she overcame all odds to set up JetSetGo, which she started in 2012 with her friend Sudheer Perla. The startup, branded the Uber of Indian skies, identified problems with chartering planes that no one had done before, and used innovative technologies to make the process easier for customers. It uses a mix of tech, unique maintenance procedures, and SMART management, according to the Indiatimes report, to ensure profitability and reduce maintenance costs while making it easier for customers to book charter flights. Speaking about the hurdles she faced, Tekriwal told The New Indian Express: “We expected rich plane owners to list their planes and customers to book them from our platform, but our first flight never took off as the pilot didn’t show up."

5,"'Largest python ever' captured in US: It's 18 feet long, weighs 98 kg and has 122 eggs",trends," A team of US researchers captured the largest Burmese python ever discovered in the state, Florida officials announced on Thursday. The female serpent, is almost 18 feet long and weighed about 98 kg, according to the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. This species is considered to be an invasive one in Florida, researchers said. “Look at the scale of the problem” - some 18 feet of very dead invasive python - the largest ever removed from Florida, complete with 120 eggs and adult white-tailed deer hooves - at @ConservancySWFL, which is working to remove them from the Everglades. pic.twitter.com/Zm0xHsZqlb  During examination, the snake was found to have 122 eggs in its abdomen. With this the python broke another record for the most eggs female python can produce in a breeding cycle, the publication stated. Moreover, researchers also found “hoof cores” inside the snake’s stomach indicating that it's last meal was a white tailed deer. Read more: Snake bites man in the butt as he sat playing video game on toilet But how was this Burmese python found? The wildlife biologists revealed that they used a unique research programme that uses radio transmitters implanted in male snakes to lead them to breeding grounds where “large, reproductive females” can be removed to stop their eggs from hatching in the wild. Speaking about this process, Ian Bartoszek, wildlife biologist and environmental science project manager for the Conservancy told New York Post, “How do you find the needle in the haystack? You could use a magnet, and in a similar way our male scout snakes are attracted to the biggest females around."" “The removal of female pythons plays a critical role in disrupting the breeding cycle of these apex predators that are wreaking havoc on the Everglades ecosystem and taking food sources from other native species,” he told the publication. “This is the wildlife issue of our time for southern Florida.”"
6,Not planning to inoculate children below 12 years for COVID: NTAGI on US vaccinating children under five,trends," India is not considering lowering the eligibility of COVID-19 vaccine administration in children below 12 years, an official from the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told Moneycontrol. NTAGI is India’s vaccine think tank, an apex advisory body on immunisation, which provides guidance and advice to the Union health ministry. “We have not considered vaccinating kids below the age group of 12 years. The uptake of COVID vaccine in the age group above 12-8 years is tepid and we are just focusing on the population that is susceptible to severe infection,” said an official who is part of NTAGI, asking not to be named. Responding to a query related to the US starting COVID vaccination for children aged six months to five years, the NTAGI official said, “The Indian government is in no hurry to administer COVID-19 vaccines to children below 12 years of age.” Also read: Oncologists welcome FDA’s proposal to limit nicotine in cigarettes, but say India has a long road ahead Days after the US Food and Drug Administration's authorisation, the US government started distributing mRNA-based COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for children aged six months to five years across the country, according to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha. “We believe that a majority of kids have natural protection and the kids have reported minimal severity our focus is only on the age group above 12 years and the aim is to vaccinate comorbid children rapidly,” he added. The office of the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) has approved two vaccines—Serum Institute of India's Covovax and the Biological E-manufactured Corbevax—for administration in the 5-12-year age group. The DCGI in April had also given emergency use authorisation to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for the 6-12-year cohort.  However, NTAGI meetings reviewing data from vaccine makers for children in the 5-12 years bracket have remained inconclusive. Kids have natural immunity and don't need vaccines. Experts say COVID vaccines in children may not provide any additional benefit as most have already developed immunity as they have been exposed to the infection earlier.  Shilpa Sharma, chair of the Delhi Association of Paediatric Surgeons, said that there is no point in giving kids more vaccines and subjecting them to more antigens. “The additional immunity can interfere with the natural immunity of the children. If the natural infection goes down, it may bring a host of other infections they are normally immune to,” she said."

10,Monkey in tiny bullet-proof vest found dead after cartel shootout in Mexico,trends," Mexican narcos fascination with exotic animals was on display this week after a spider monkey dressed up as a drug gang mascot was killed in a shootout, a 450-pound (200 kilogram) tiger wandered the streets in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, and a man died after trying to pet a captive tiger in a cartel-dominated area of western Michoacan state. Like scenes out of a narco television series, exotic animals have been long been part of the Mexican criminal underworld. Photos from the scene of a shootout Tuesday with police in which 11 drug gang members died, showed a small monkey dressed in a tiny camouflage jacket and a tiny bullet-proof vest sprawled across the body of a dead gunman who was apparently his owner. Authorities in the State of Mexico confirmed the authenticity of the photos, and said it was unclear whether the monkey which was also wearing a diaper died in the hail of bullets that killed his owner. A primate was killed at the scene, which was presumably owned by a criminal who was also killed at the scene, state prosecutors said in a statement, adding An autopsy will be carried out on the animal by a veterinarian specialized in the species and animal-trafficking charges would be considered against the suspects who survived the shootout. Then on Wednesday, the Attorney General for Environmental Protection said it had seized a tiger in Tecuala, in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, near the border with Sinaloa, which is home to the cartel of the same name. The office said it acted after receiving reports about a Bengal tiger that was wandering the streets of Tecuala, and found that the animal was being illegally kept there. Those reports were based on a video posted on social media earlier this week, showing a young woman shrieking as she came across the tiger on the street in a residential neighborhood. Be quiet, it might come close, a woman can be heard saying on the video. Authorities said the tigers claws and fangs had been removed, and a man can be seen later in the video casually tossing a rope over the tigers neck and leading him away. Perhaps the most tragic story came out of the western state of Michoacan, which has long been dominated by the Carteles Unidos gang and the Jalisco cartel. On Sunday, authorities confirmed that a man was seriously wounded by a tiger in Periban, Michoacan, a town in the states avocado-growing region, where gangs have long extorted protection payments from the lucrative avocado trade. In a video posted on social media, whose authenticity could not be confirmed, the man is seen calling the tiger to the side of a fenced enclosure. Come on, come, the man can be heard entreating. The man stands outside the enclosure, apparently feeding the tiger with one hand, while he stretches his other arm through the chain-link fence to stroke the animals neck. The man then shrieks in pain after the tiger quickly wheels and bites the extended arm and refuses to let go. Eventually the tiger mauled both the mans arms. Michoacan state law enforcement authorities confirmed that the man was taken to a hospital, where he died a few days later from his injuries. Mexican law allows private citizens to keep exotic animals if they register them under strictly supervised conditions. But Security analyst David Saucedo said criminals sometimes go to the length of getting such permits. Saucedo said drug traffickers often keep exotic animals as a symbol of status and power, imitating the Colombian drug lords of the 1980s and 90s. Mexican drug traffickers copied from the narcos of the Medellin cartel the custom of acquiring exotic animals and setting up private zoos, said Saucedo. According to the code of the drug trafficking aristocracy, having a private zoo was a prerequisite for being part of the circle of big-time drug traffickers. In some cases, the animals had a more sinister use. Some drug cartel capos, like Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano, acquired exotic animals to torture or disappear their victims, Saucedo said. Several of his enemies were devoured by the tigers or the crocodiles that the Zetas kept in their pens or cages."

""In the beginning, I planned to make a car for the disabled, but due to some financial issues, I could not carry the project forward,"" Ahmed said. He then decided to create a car that ran on solar power, The Quint reported. The Mathematics teacher also met several experts and drew inspiration from innovator called John DeLorean, who started his company DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) that makes luxurious and affordable cars. ""Cars like Mercedes, Ferrari, BMW are a dream for a common person. Only the rich can afford such cars. I thought it would be great to allow people a feeling of luxuriousness through this innovation,"" Indiatimes quoted Ahmed as saying.

12,The initial sales of Nothing Phone (1) will be done through an invite-only system,trends," Through a new video posted on their YouTube channel, Nothing has announced that the initial sale period of their upcoming smartphone, Phone (1), would be limited to invite only. In the video, Nothing says that this will help get the smartphone in the hands of people that ""deserve it the most"", and company founder Carl Pei said that the company had two options when deciding on a path for sale, either wait and accumulate enough stock to sell the device in large quantities or use an invite-only system, which will help them keep their inventory in check and control sales. The invite-only system isn't new, it has been employed by both Xiaomi and OnePlus in the past, but it isn't exactly the most convenient way to buy a smartphone.  You either register and hope you get an invite, or get an invite from someone else who has already bought the phone. Personally, I would have preferred if they had just waited and accumulated enough stock. While it makes sense for the company to do this to predict and anticipate stocks, it is a hassle for the end consumer. The weird marketing pull of sending the phones to users who ""deserve it the most"" is also sure to rub people the wrong way."
13,International Olympic Day 2022: 10 inspiring quotes from Olympic icons,trends," The Olympic Games are the world’s most prestigious sporting event. With over 200 nations participating in summer and winter sports competitions held every four years, the Olympics are also one of the oldest sporting events in the world. Every year, June 23 is celebrated as International Olympic Day. It is a day when sportspeople and athletes converge across the world to promote the many benefits of playing games and sports – not the least of which is fitness and good health. The idea of International Olympic Day dates back to 1947, when Doctor Gruss, a member of the International Olympic Committee, submitted a report suggesting the celebration of Olympic Day. The first International Olympic Day was celebrated in 1948. June 23 was picked as the date to observe Olympic Day as this was the date on which the International Olympic Committee was formed in 1894. As nations across the world celebrate International Olympic Day 2022, here is a look at some inspiring quotes form Olympic icons through the ages: “It’s not wise to blindly copy what others are doing.” – Abhinav Bindra “You have to believe in yourself when no one else does — that makes you a winner right there.” - Venus Williams “If you dream and you allow yourself to dream you can do anything. And that's what this Olympic medal represents.” - Clara Hughes “Without passion, you won't do something 100 percent. That's the bottom line. And what's the point of doing something if you're not doing it 100 percent?” – Apolo Anton Ohno “Failure I can live with. Not trying is what I can’t handle.” – Sanya Richards Ross “Never put an age limit on your dreams.” - Dara Torres “Gold medals aren’t really made of gold. They’re made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts.” – Dan Gable “Hard work has made it easy. That is my secret. That is why I win.” ― Nadia Comaneci “This ability to conquer oneself is no doubt the most precious of all things sports bestows.” – Olga Korbut"

In case you missed it @hormazdsorabjee EV fires will happen. Happens in all global products too. EV fires are much less frequent than ICE fires. https://t.co/gGowsWTKZV  But Bhavish Aggarwal's comment raised concerns among Twitter users. ""You still did not get the thing didn't you Bhavish? You have a fantastic product. I personally desire it. But the way some failures have come across are life threatening man.

If EV fire will happen maybe it’s not right for any company to release a product until the research and development team overcomes it. I’m sure the number of Tesla EVs catching fire like Ola scooters is 1:100 with sales volume. Can we expect Ola cars to catch fire?"" asked Manhar Singh (@Manhar_Aman). Another Twitter user Chetan Shetty (@chethszone) commented, ""You are saying EV fires happen, so casually. Do people's lives matter?"" There were, however, a few who defended Aggarwal's stand on EV fires. ""What he means is however strong quality measures a manufacturer have had in place. There will always be some exceptions wherein fires will happen,"" wrote Harsh Narayan (@hurshnarayan). Recently, there have been several incidents of EVs catching fire in various parts of the country following which the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) under the Union Consumer Affairs Ministry issued a notice to Ola Electric, sources told CNBC-TV18. It gave Ola Electric 15 days to reply to the notice.

16,"Who is Dr Arati Prabhakar, the Indian-American nominated to key White House post",trends," US President Joe Biden has nominated Dr Arati Prabhakar as Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and assistant to the President on science and technology — which will propel the Indian-American scientist to a key White House position if the nomination is confirmed. If confirmed by the Senate, Dr Prabhakar will make history as the first woman, immigrant, or person of colour to head the OSTP. Her nomination was met with enthusiasm by the Indian-American community, which is already amply represented in the White House. Besides US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first Indian-American to hold the high office, the Biden administration also has a number of other Indian-Americans, including Biden’s Staff Secretary, Associate Attorney General and chief speech writer. Who is Dr Arati Prabhakar? Arati Prabhakar is an Indian-American scientist who was born in India and immigrated to the United States at the age of three. She is an engineer and applied physicist with several management and leadership roles to her credit. Dr Prabhakar has professional experience in a wide range of sectors – including startups, large companies, universities, government labs, and nonprofits. In 1993, she was appointed director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology by then-US President William Clinton. At the age of just 34, she became the first woman to hold the position and led a 3,000-person organisation.

17,Harsh Goenka’s post on Bitcoin investor has a hilarious twist in the end,trends," Traders are losing sleep over the carnage in the crypto market – but there is at least one Bitcoin investor who is “sleeping like a baby” even as the world's most popular crypto asset falls to its lowest since 2020. Bitcoin, which reached a record high of $69,000 in November,. So when Harsh Goenka asked a Bitcoin investor if he is worried about the prices falling, he was surprised to hear the answer. The chairman of RPG Enterprises took to Twitter to share a hilarious post on Bitcoin’s declines – one of the many such posts that have surfaced online in a broader cryptocurrency crash. “I asked a Bitcoin investor if he’s worried about the Bitcoin prices falling,” wrote Harsh Goenka on Twitter. “The investor replied, he’s worried but sleeps like a baby.” When Goenka looked surprise – because the term “sleeping like a baby” is generally associated with sleeping peacefully – the Bitcoin investor offered a clarification. I asked a Bitcoin investor if he’s worried about the Bitcoin prices falling.The investor replied, he’s worried but sleeps like a baby.I showed surpriseHe clarified “Like a baby I mean, I sleep for a couple of hours, then wake up, cry for a while and then go back to sleep."" The post, with its hilarious twist in the end, has proved to be very popular on the microblogging platform, racking up more than 5,000 ‘likes’ and a ton of amused comments. According to news agency AFP, the value of the global crypto market fell below the symbolic $1 trillion mark on Monday after reaching $3 trillion in November of last year. Bitcoin's fall has been accelerated by the suspension of withdrawals by two cryptocurrency platforms. The Celsius Network said it was pausing ""all withdrawals, swap, and transfers between accounts"" due to ""extreme market conditions."" Babel Finance said it was facing ""unusual liquidity pressures."" Bitcoin, however, regained $20,000 after sinking to an 18-month low of $17,599 in weekend deals."
18,Made-in-India Tejas for Malaysian Air Force? India emerges as top contender for fighter jet order,trends," India has emerged as the top contender for a Malaysian requirement of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) with a package deal that would include maintenance and spares for the nation’s Russian-origin Su 30 fighter jets, the Economic Times reported on June 23. The Malaysian air force is looking to buy 18 new light fighter jets. India is offering an appealing package for LCA Tejas for this deal. It has committed that it can keep Malaysia’s fleet of 18 Su 30 MKM jets flightworthy, given the vast spares reserve and technical expertise available with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the report noted. The Tejas is an indigenously developed, single-engine, fourth-generation, high-agility, multirole, supersonic light combat aircraft. One thing where India has the upper hand in its bid is that the other contenders - primarily South Korea and China - do not have backend contracts with Russian manufacturers to work on the Sukhoi fighters, it said. India has priced LCA Tejas at around $42 million per unit for the package. It is to be noted that the Indian government has set an annual export target of $5 billion, or Rs 36,500 crore by 2025."

21,Vienna makes comeback as the world's 'most liveable city',trends," The Austrian capital Vienna has made a comeback as the world's most liveable city, according to an annual report from the Economist published Thursday. The Ukrainian capital Kyiv was not included this year after Russia invaded the country in late February, while Russian cities Moscow and St Petersburg fell in the rankings over ""censorship"" and the impact of Western sanctions. Vienna snatched the top spot from Auckland, which tumbled down to 34th place due to coronavirus pandemic restrictions, according to the report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). ""Vienna, which slipped to 12th place in our rankings in early 2021 as its museums and restaurants were closed, has since rebounded to first place, the position it held in 2018 and 2019,"" it said. ""Stability and good infrastructure are the city's main charms for its inhabitants, supported by good healthcare and plenty of opportunities for culture and entertainment."" Europe boasted six out of the top ten cities. The Austrian capital was followed by the Danish capital Copenhagen and Switzerland's Zurich. Fellow Swiss city Geneva came sixth, Germany's Frankfurt seventh, and the Netherlands' Amsterdam ninth. Canada also did well. Calgary came in joint third position, followed by Vancouver in fifth place and Toronto in eighth. Japan's Osaka and Australia's Melbourne shared the tenth place. France's capital Paris came 19th, 23 places up from last year. The Belgian capital Brussels was 24th, just behind Canada's Montreal. The United Kingdom's capital London was the world's 33rd most liveable city, while Spain's Barcelona and Madrid came 35th and 43rd respectively. Italy's Milan ranked number 49, the US city of New York 51, and China's Beijing came 71st. Lebanon's capital Beirut, which was ravaged by a 2020 port explosion and is battling a crippling financial crisis, was not included in the ranking of business destinations. Neither was the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, after the Russian invasion on February 24 forced the the EIU to abort its survey of the city. Russia's capital Moscow saw its liveability ranking fall by 15 places, while St Petersburg slipped by 13 places. ""Increased censorship accompanies the ongoing conflict,"" the report noted. ""Russian cities are additionally seeing restrictions on culture and environment as a result of Western economic sanctions."" Other cities in eastern Europe cities were considered less stable following ""raised diplomatic tensions"" due to the war in Ukraine."
22,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,trends," Indian economy likely to slow down on more interest rate hikes The Reserve Bank will further hike benchmark interest rates, and the spending squeeze that would follow will likely slow down the economy, members of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee noted in its last meeting. The committee raised the benchmark repo rate by 0.5 percentage point earlier this month after a 0.4 percentage point increase at an unscheduled meeting in May. Why it’s important: The Reserve Bank has joined the battle against persistently high inflation. Higher borrowing costs in a demand-driven economy like India’s will have an impact on economic recovery.  Digital finance companies to petition government and central bank for regulatory clarity After the Reserve Bank said prepaid payment instruments must not be loaded through credit lines from non-bank lenders, the country’s top digital finance companies are joining together to petition the government and the central bank for clarity on the directive. The government too wants a regulatory framework for fintech firms because of complaints of potential breaches in prudential norms. Why it’s important: Using credit lines to top up prepaid cards has become increasingly popular among fintech companies in the buy now, pay later segment. Unsecured lines of credit increase risk in the system and need to be properly regulated.  Officials reject demand for reducing GST on 200 items A committee of officials has proposed a change in GST for a host of items but rejected demands for a reduction of levy on 200 goods and services, even as the GST council meets next week. The committee is likely to suggest an increased rate for tetra packs. Why It’s important: The easing of tax on 200 items was part of efforts to ease the inflationary burden on consumers. The GST Council has a lot of ground to cover on the rate rationalisation front.  CBDT issues guidelines on tax deducted at source for crypto assets The Central Board of Direct Taxes has issued guidelines on tax deducted at source on cryptocurrencies. From July 1, TDS of 1 percent will be levied on payments towards cryptocurrencies beyond Rs 10,000 in a year. Under the new regime, the transactions will have to be disclosed in the tax return and a paper trail will have to be maintained. Why it’s important: The guidelines will help both buyers and sellers since they can enter into contracts with an exchange for passing the responsibility to deduct tax on their behalf on virtual asset transfers.  RBI taps top banks to run pilot on blockchain-based trade financing HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India are among the top lenders the Reserve Bank is engaging with to run a blockchain-based pilot project centered on trade financing. Belgium-based SettleMint, US-based Corda Technologies and IBM would provide technology support for the project driven by the RBI’s innovation hub in Bangalore. Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank of India are also involved. Why it’s important: The pilot seeks to make blockchain technology a part of the core banking system that could help prevent loan frauds by the likes of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, borrowers who gamed the system to siphon off billions.  Google against frequent sharing of citizen data with government Frequent and large-scale sharing of citizen data, even if anonymised, can damage users’ privacy, Google’s chief privacy officer Keith Enright has warned. On May 26, the ministry of electronics and information technology announced a draft framework to govern citizen data that proposed rules through which data sets from government and private entities can be accessed by the research and innovation ecosystem. Why it’s important: An earlier draft framework had proposed to monetise government data. India wants data localisation for sensitive or critical personal data, but Big Tech argues there is no clear definition regarding sensitivity and criticality.  Indian rupee slides to new low on global recession worries The rupee slumped to another record low of 78.39 against the dollar as global recession worries resurfaced. The Reserve Bank is estimated to have sold about $1. 5 billion through a mix of spot and forward market interventions using multiple state-run banks. Why it’s important: The run on the rupee continues due to lack of confidence among investors. The local currency is likely to remain volatile amid about of fund outflows from India. Unless oil prices cool, global recession fears will keep haunting the financial markets.  Domestic wealth managers prop up equity markets after foreign money bails out Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) led by mutual funds and insurers have pumped in Rs 2.16 trillion into Indian equities so far in 2022, helping cushion the impact of the Rs 2 trillion plus outflow from foreign funds. Ever since foreign portfolio investor (FPI) outflows started from October 2021, DIIs have invested Rs 2.8 trillion into stocks. FPIs have sold Indian stocks worth Rs 2.4 trillion since October last year. Why it’s important: Continuously increasing flows from retail investors into equity mutual fund schemes have been the main driver of domestic money into the stock market. This is likely to continue as returns from other asset classes like real estate remain muted.  India’s exports of orthodox tea rise as Sri Lanka battles economic crisis As Sri Lanka struggles with an economic crisis, India’s tea planters and exporters see an opportunity to expand business. Calls to Indian planters and exporters from foreign buyers of Sri Lankan orthodox tea are pouring in and the buoyant sentiment is reflecting in prices at auction centres. Why it’s important: India is reaping the benefits of the anticipated shortfall due to the Sri Lankan crisis. The increased demand is also showing up in higher prices.  Secondhand phone seller Cashify raises $90 million in funding Online used-phone seller Cashify has raised $90 million (Rs 700 crore) in a funding round led by new investors NewQuest Capital Partners and Prosus.

23,'32GB phone carrying 31.9GB data': Telangana Police uses viral video to spread road safety awareness,trends," The Telangana police on Wednesday used an innovative method to spread awareness on road safety -- using a viral video. A Twitter user, who goes by @sagarcasm, posted a video showing a man riding a scooter stacked with goods. While there is hardly any space for the man to sit on the vehicle, he is surprisingly wearing a helmet. “My 32GB phone carrying 31.9 GB data,"" the user captioned the photo. There is a possibility to retrieve the data from the Mobile, even if it's damaged.But not life...So our appeal to people avoid putting their life's at risk and others too.#FollowTrafficRules #RoadSafety @HYDTP @CYBTRAFFIC @Rachakonda_tfc @hydcitypolice @cyberabadpolice https://t.co/Z6cipHFfDr  Soon, Twitter users joined in on the humourous take on the video. “Most of them are the files generated in what’s app database folder!” Hiren Jagad commented. Another Twitter user Panoti (@theusoo_) said, “Me after downloading app to increase my phone space from play store."" There were others, however, that urged the police to take action against the man for flouting traffic rules, risking his life and that of others. ""Shouldn't any action be initiated, as this man is putting others life at risk in case of any accident takes place?"" wrote Pijush Das. ""Please take action and ensure that existing rules are executed. They get more confidence in these things if they see that law and order are not enforced,"" user Ranjeet Patil commented. "
24,Here’s what the new TDS rule means for social media influencers,trends," Content creators are making calls to tax experts, chartered accountants and influencer marketing agencies to understand what a new clause, Section 194R in the Income-tax Act which is applicable to social media influencers, means for them. Ocean Sharma, an e-sports player with an Instagram following of 328,000, is reaching out to his CA friends to find out more about the new provision which mandates tax deducted at source (TDS) on freebies influencers receive from businesses for sales promotion. It was Budget 2022-23 that had brought in the provision of TDS at 10 percent for any person providing any benefit or perquisite exceeding Rs 20,000 in a year to a resident arising from the business or profession of such resident. For influencers, this means that they will have to disclose the free samples they receive from brands or companies while filing their income tax return and TDS will be applicable if the freebies are retained by them since such items will be deemed a perquisite. In case the influencer returns the free samples, TDS will not apply. Hidden promotional expense “People used to get benefits but there was no avenue for the government to track this because it was not reported in (income tax) filing and to plug this gap the tax authorities have introduced this new section,” said tax expert Ravishankar Raghavan, partner, tax and private client group, Majmudar & Partners. He added that the new provision is to widen the tax base and to ensure that recipients declare the free samples they receive as income while filing their taxes. Influencer marketing platforms that are the bridge between content creators and brands pointed out that many brands that offer influencers free samples or gifts as a goodwill gesture in return for a post on social media would not show it in their books as a promotional expense. While a promotional expenditure by brands, this remained untracked because influencers did not disclose it while filing income tax returns. “Free samples often shared with the influencers are also shared with the expectation of them endorsing it, which benefits the company. By marketing the product the influencer is extending a service to the brand, making it a transaction. But now with such a provision, a lot of influencers may hold back from barter collaborations largely because of the lack of clarity around the subject,” said Ishan Jindal, founder and CEO, Wobb, an influencer marketing agency. He added that barter collaborations are one of the primary go-to methods for both brands and influencers. “For brands because of the cost efficiency and for influencers because of the feasibility and availability of such collaborations,” he said. Vaibhav Odhekar, Managing director India & Middle East, AnyMind Group which operates influencer marketing platform AnyTag said that while many brands and influencers had started complying with 10% TDS for commercial transactions like cost per post or brand endorsements, the same was not applied to barter deals. Now, under the new rule, influencers can be asked to file advance tax if the value of the gifts received exceeds Rs 20,000 in a year, said Arpan Soni, head of client servicing and talent management, IPLIX Media, an influencer marketing firm. According to the Central Board of Direct Taxes circular on TDS on benefits or perquisites, if a person is providing benefit in kind to a recipient and tax is required to be deducted under Section 194R, the person has to ensure that the tax that has to be deducted has been paid by the recipient. Impact of new TDS rule “This will affect micro-influencers negatively as they primarily do barter associations only. It is a way for them to build relationships with these brands while they are setting up their base in the field,” said IPLIX Media’s Soni. Micro-influencers are categorised as those who have 100,000 to a million followers. Soni added that the tax rule will also impact tech influencers as they get gadget review units from brands to keep. “Both the tech brands and influencers will now have to track these exchanges in detail. Travel influencers get flight or hotel tickets in exchange for promotion. It will be tricky for these people to work as it used to be mutually beneficial for both brands and influencers,” said Soni. Ketan Dalal, MD, Katalyst Advisors, an advisory firm, said that the new section was not in keeping with the concept of ease of doing business. “This is going to be an extremely cumbersome process for everyone—the creators, the agency and the brand—to track and file these deals,” said Shivam Agarwal, founder, Deckster.Live. Kunal Kishore Sinha, co-founder and COO, ClanConnect, an influencer marketing platform, pointed out that a lot of content creators are young professionals who are not aware about tax filing. “These people don’t have access to an accountant or CAs. In fact, a creator from Bhubaneswar who we were in touch was not able to give us a proper invoice.” Validation for influencers But he said the reason for the new rule is because it is an unorganised sector and the government wants to bring the entire industry under the tax ambit. “There is a recognition at the government level that this is a new breed of professionals that are getting created. This means a massive validation for the (influencer) space. Generally, you have mention of professionals like CEOs but now you have an influencer also.” Digital content creator Rasleen Grover said that given the strong growth the influencer space has been seeing in revenue, it became necessary to have regulatory framework. In addition, Pranav Panpalia, founder, OpraahFx, an influencer marketing agency, said that the new tax rule is a wake-up call for creators and agencies who have been very actively working via barter deals. “While barter may be a good way to pay in kind, it definitely doesn’t help creators pay their bills. This regulation was a need because cash or not, an earning via any mode is an earning and one has to pay tax on it.” Sharing similar sentiments, Vedant Rusty, who creates content on films and web series, said, “This method of collaboration (free samples) was fundamentally unfair to the creators since, in my experience, not all products are used, most of them are actually discarded, handed down or resold.” Earnings and brand deals Pranav Agarwal, co-founder, Sociowash, a digital marketing firm, expects such deals to decline due to the new tax rule. Some, though, don’t expect any substantial financial implication due to the new tax rule. Influencer Paritosh Anand, who creates content on various subjects and has a social media following of around 200,000, believes content creators’ earnings will not be affected but adds that the new provision is a complication. But agencies think that there will be some impact on earnings. “Such a provision is bound to affect the earnings of the influencers largely because a lot of collaborations are barter and sampling-based. The grey area might make some influencers hesitant about such collaborations altogether,” said Jindal."

0,UK rail strikes: What to expect and do if you are visiting Britain this week,trends," If there’s one activity that affects the economy and also has the greatest direct impact on the lives of people, it is transport strikes. England is now in the midst of its biggest train strike in over three decades. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union called for the strikes in disputes over pay, working conditions and job losses. Unlike India, the railway sector is not nationalised in the UK and there are 28 different train operators across the UK. The RMT is the country’s largest transport trade union which has 83,000 members in railways, shipping, buses, and road freight. The walkout this week has been called for June 21, 23 and 25, with the possibility that there would be strikes in July as well, although no dates have been set. This is because the union says that if demands are not met, travellers must expect six months of industrial action. (Photo: Danish Khan) Though the strike in June is for three days, the impact will be felt for the entire week as there will be a cascading effect that will upset travel schedules. Employees of Transport for London (TfL), which is a government body responsible for transport network in London, joined other rail workers only on June 21, disruptions are still expected in London this entire week. Hospitality, high street shops, small businesses are also affected due to the strike. The strike presents a huge problem for those travelling to the airports in London as all of them – Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted, London City – are served well by trains. But in situation like these, the quicker and cheaper train connectivity becomes a bane from being a boon. Here are some tips if you are flying into London, to help negotiate the strike: Airport services: Apart from the cheaper TfL lines, all the airports have special train connections which have been badly affected, but are operational. The Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express, Stansted Express, services to Luton are all running, but with the advice to travel only if the journey is absolutely necessary. Well, if you have a flight to catch, you can’t afford to miss, or are landing in the UK that should count as necessary. Be ready for disruption and give plenty of time for the journey. Buses: The airports are also connected by the National Express, England’s major coach operator. Megabus is another coach operator that offers airport connectivity. They are cheap, efficient, and accept contactless payment, but in the wake of train strikes, prices have been increased. It will be handy to have their apps for latest updates and ease of buying tickets. They won’t be as fast as trains, but far cheaper to travel to cities outside London. If you are going to be in London, then you can make the most of London buses which will of course see added pressure. You can take multiple TfL buses within one hour at the single journey cost of £1.65. Cabs: This is the moment when cab services see a huge demand accompanied by surge pricing. It is handy to remember that mini-cab services – London has innumerable local cab operators – are generally cheaper than the traditional black cabs. The price difference can be staggering (especially airport transfers) between black cabs and mini-cab services. You can simply google local mini-cab services, and call them to book a cab. You can bargain, if what they quote sounds astronomical. You can also choose from the bigger networks like Uber, Bolt, Ola, Via and others. Prepare to pay surge pricing. Sudden cancellations and longer waiting times are not uncommon right now."

Sharing the story, software engineer Prasad Jambhale wrote, ""So, the story goes back when my mother was of the age 16 years, her father died and the financial crisis followed, to ensure that her siblings continue their education, she had to quit the education and start working."" Kalpana Jambhale got a chance to resume her education last year during a visit to a government school in Mumbai when a teacher informed her that there’s a government scheme which can help people who have not completed their SSC exams appear for it again for free.

""As I stay in Ireland, I came to know about it just recently when I was about to get married before her exams. Whenever I was in Ireland and used to call during Indian night-time, I used to ask where’s mom? And I was told that she has gone for a walk, I thought that’s odd that she got interested into walks.

2,"Blood test that can detect breast cancer, available in India now",trends," A first-of-its-kind blood test that can detect breast cancer even in very early stages was launched in the country on June 22 and has been made available by Datar Cancer Genetics which has partnered with the Apollo group of hospitals. The test, being branded as EasyCheck Breast, will cost Rs 6,000. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November last year and is indicated as an annual test for healthy women above the age of 40 years who may not have any symptoms. It is available in nearly 15 countries including in Europe under different brand names. The technology claims to have nearly 99 percent sensitivity, which means it has less than 1 percent of false-positive reports, with over 88 percent specificity, which means that in about 12 percent of cases there is a chance of false negativity though. To begin with, the test will be available through Apollo’s hospitals but the group wants to expand it to all of its 1,600 blood collection centers eventually. Also read: Explainer | Dostarlimab for cancer cure: Hope or hype? Prathap Reddy, founder, and chairman of Apollo hospitals dubbed the test as a revolutionary step in the direction of catching breast cancer very early in Indian women. Datar, however, has made it clear that despite the test’s high success rate in detecting cancer at a very early stage, this should not be treated as a replacement for the conventional screening tools for breast cancer such as mammograms and ultrasonography. Dr. Ramesh Sarin, a senior surgical oncologist with Apollo hospital in Delhi pointed out at the launch of the test that women who test positive for cancer using the new technology can forego conventional screening examinations and can straight away go for a biopsy and plan their treatment. However, those who test negative should still also go for other screening tests to rule out cancer completely. How it works This blood test uses a proprietary technology developed by Datar Cancer Genetics to detect circulating tumor cells and clusters or biomarkers that are specific to breast cancer with very high accuracy. Data from clinical trials, conducted on over 8,000 women in India, for the test has shown that it can detect stage 0 and Stage 1 breast cancers with an accuracy of better than 99% without any false positives. The test has been validated on more than 20,000 women comprising healthy and cancer patients, the company said. The advantage of the test is that it requires only 5 ml of blood and does not involve exposure to any radiation or discomfort associated with mammography. The data presented by Dr Chirantan Bose, director, of patient services at Datar showed that the test can detect more than 80 percent of cases in stage 0, over 90 percent cases in stage 1, over 95 percent cases in stage 2 and 3 and 100 percent cases in stage 4 of cancer.

The estimated number of incident cases in India in 2020 was 180000 and experts say that nearly 50 percent of those diagnosed with this malignancy die due to late diagnoses and bad prognosis (treatment outcome). Statistics show that a whopping 80 percent of the breast cancer cases in India are detected at stages two and three while this number is just 29 percent in the case the USA."

4,"Oncologists welcome FDA’s proposal to limit nicotine in cigarettes, but say India has a long road ahead",trends," Indian oncologists welcomed the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) proposal to limit nicotine levels in cigarettes in that country but said India’s battle against tobacco is far more complex and challenging. Ganesh Nagarajan, Director - HPB Surgery & Gastrointestinal Oncology, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai, said capping the level of nicotine will directly reduce the incidence of cancer given that nicotine is a highly addictive substance and that reducing its levels could reduce dependence on the carcinogenic substance, but added that would be of limited use in India. “It’s a welcome step, a lot of cancer specialists have been lobbying a lot to reduce the accessibility of cigarettes, but in semi-urban and rural India, apart from bidis (tobacco wrapped in tendu leaves, which are much cheaper than cigarettes and more easily available in rural areas, chewable tobacco is the reasons behind oral and laryngeal cancer,” he said. Also read: CBI apprehends Joint Drug Controller in alleged Rs 4 lakh bribery case Rahul Bhargava, principal director, haematology-oncology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, outside Delhi, too said that a lot of recent cancer cases are from rural India and added that cigarettes form just one component, and that the bulk of tobacco addiction in rural India is due to chewable tobacco. According to a professional with a US-based multinational company working in the healthcare and pharmaceuticals segment, the largest number of cancer cases in India relate to the neck and head, almost always caused by tobacco consumption, followed by breast cancer. This clearly indicates that chewing tobacco was of greater concern than combustible tobacco when it came to cancer, the person said. Tough task for India to limit nicotine in tobacco products When asked if India should also consider limiting nicotine levels in tobacco products, Dr Nagarajan reiterated his point. “In India apart from smoking, people chew it, they use it as toothpaste. It will need huge political will to get something of this sort implemented in India,” he said. Also read: Online gaming pushing adolescents into aggressive behaviour: Experts Dr Bharagava said the poor consume chewable tobacco to kill the appetite so that they can work without food. “Social evils need to be dealt with first. Addiction doesn't start at the age of 18 or 20, rather they start taking tobacco at a very small age. This is where the government's holistic approach for tobacco control is needed,” he added. Akshat Malik, senior consultant, head and neck oncology, Max Hospital in Delhi’s Saket, said that limiting nicotine content in cigarettes will probably bring down the addiction in some but the magnitude of the tobacco problem in India won’t change. “It’s a step in the right direction but one needs to understand that in the Indian scenario, smoking is just one aspect, one-third of our population consumes tobacco in one form or the other. A majority of Indians are tobacco chewers and not smokers,” Dr Malik added. Also read: Air pollution India’s worst health threat, shortening life by 10 years in Delhi, says AQLI report FDA’s proposal on limiting nicotine in cigarettes The FDA is planning to develop a proposed product standard that would establish a maximum nicotine level to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes and certain other combusted tobacco products. “Nicotine is powerfully addictive. Lowering nicotine levels to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels would decrease the likelihood that future generations of young people become addicted to cigarettes and help more currently addicted smokers to quit,” FDA commissioner Robert M. Califf said. According to the FDA, the goal of this potential rule would be to reduce youth use, addiction and death. “Each year, 480,000 people die prematurely from a smoking-attributed disease, making tobacco use the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. Additionally, tobacco use costs nearly $300 billion a year in direct health care and lost productivity,” FDA said in a statement. What is nicotine? Nicotine, one of the additives used in cigarettes and other tobacco products, is an addictive factor and it makes it very hard to quit smoking. It is present in other tobacco products as well, including supari (betel nut, an ingredient in paan), guthka (packaged chewing tobacco made of, among other things, betel nut and tobacco, with a sweet or savoury flavouring) and bidis. Nicotine, apart from being a component which can cause cancer, it also affects the heart."
5,Hollywood star Ben Stiller meets Ukraine president Zelensky: ‘You’re my hero’,trends," Hollywood star Ben Stiller met Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Monday, hailing the comedian-turned-president as ""my hero"" for rallying the world's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion. ""It's a great honour for me.. you're my hero!"" said Stiller, a UN goodwill ambassador who met the Ukrainian leader on World Refugee Day. ""What you've done, the way that you've rallied the country, the world, it's really inspiring,"" said the 56-year-old American comedian referring to Zelensky's countless speeches to audiences around the world to rally support for his embattled country. Footage of their meeting was released by Zelensky's office. Earlier on Monday, Stiller visited the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, the scene of fierce battles early on in the invasion and the closest Moscow's army got to the capital since it sent troops into Ukraine in February. ""I feel it's hard to understand what's actually going on here if you haven't been here,"" he told Zelensky. ""I was in Irpin this morning.. and the actual level of destruction, you see it on TV, you see it on social media, but it's something else to actually see it, feel it and then to talk to the people,"" he said. Speaking in English, Zelensky thanked Stiller for coming and told him it was ""very important"" for him to keep reminding people what was going on in Ukraine. ""It's very important for us that people don't forget. It's not interesting to speak about the war every day.. but for us it's very important,"" the stocky Ukrainian leader told him. The pair also acknowledged their shared interest as comedy actors. ""You quit a great acting career,"" said Stiller, who is best known for his comedy roles in ""Meet the Parents"" and the ""Night at the Museum"" films, in a nod to Zelensky's former career as a comedy actor. ""Not as great as yours,"" Zelensky retorted, both laughing."

7,Varanasi airport uses Sanskrit for Covid announcements. Watch,trends," The Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport in Varanasi has added a third language for making announcements related to Covid-19. Besides English and Hindi, flyers will now be able to listen to announcements in Sanskrit as well. The move will cement Varanasi’s reputation as the ancient centre of the Sanskrit language, the Varanasi Airport said on Twitter.

The decision to make public safety announcements in Sanskrit – a classical language reportedly spoken by less than 1% of Indians – was a polarising one. While some praised the initiative, others were less impressed and dismissed it as a “gimmick”. The sheer stupidity of making a public health safety announcement in Sanskrit!

The refugee’s photograph was taken by Steve McCurry in 2017, and has captivated the internet once again after the American photographer re-posted it on Instagram a day ago. The photo shows Shabuz, a refugee from Afghanistan who now lives in Pakistan. “This portrait of Shabuz, an Afghan refugee living in Pakistan, reminds us of the millions of displaced peoples around the world,” Steve McCurry wrote while sharing the photo on Instagram Tuesday.

11,"Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic win, Draupadi Murmu as presidential pick: This Twitter user predicted it all correctly",trends," One Twitter user is being hailed a modern-day Nostradamus for correctly predicting a number of events before anyone else saw them coming. Nitiksh Srivastava foretold Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic win and Draupadi Murmu’s inclusion in the race for Raisina Hills, among other things. These events, while not unlikely, were definitely things that not many foresaw. But Srivastava shared screenshots of his old posts which make it clear that he, at least, was one step ahead when it came to predicting important events. The screenshots show that in August 2018, Srivastava posted on Facebook that Neeraj Chopra would go on to win an Olympic medal for India. In 2021, Chopra won India’s its first Olympic gold in athletics in the men's javelin event at Tokyo. In 2016, Srivastava tweeted that Ram Nath Kovind was likely to become the next president of India. Ram Nath Kovind was elected as the President of India in 2017. I am potentially on the verge of internet immortality. Come on Modi ji. Just do it! pic.twitter.com/b2KMdoFyEv His prediction came true when Murmu was named as the candidate for the presidential elections by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance. A former governor of Jharkhand and a prominent politician belonging to Odisha's tribal community, Draupadi Murmu will become the first member from the ST community to hold the top constitutional office if she is elected president. Keeping these uncannily accurate predictions in mind, it’s little wonder to see Srivastava’s post going viral on Twitter, where it has racked up over 23,000 ‘likes’ and hundreds of stunned comments."
12,Amber Heard seen shopping at discount store after being ordered to pay Johnny Depp $10 million,trends," Amber Heard was spotted bargain hunting at a discount store after her expensive and highly-publicised legal battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp. Images released by TMZ showed the Aquaman actor at TJ Maxx in the Hamptons, New York, on Thursday. Heard, accompanied by her sister Whitney Henriquez, was seen dressed casually in an oversized shirt and jeans as she perused the women’s clothing section of the well-known discount store. This comes after Amber Heard was ordered to pay $10.35 million in damages to ex-husband Johnny Depp after their defamation trial. The jury also awarded $2 million to Heard in damages, making the actual amount she owes her ex-husband closer to $8 million. It is not clear whether the Pirates star will enforce the ruling and force Heard to pay the damages. Amber Heard is spotted shopping in TJ Maxx.

13,Cambodian fisherman catches world’s biggest freshwater fish on record,trends," A fisherman on the Mekong river in Cambodia has hooked the biggest freshwater fish ever recorded, scientists said -- a 300-kilogram stingray. The giant freshwater stingray, which measured four metres (13 feet) from snout to tail, was caught last week and released back into the wild after being fitted with a tag to track its behaviour. The monstrous bottom-dweller beat the previous record for biggest recorded freshwater fish, held by a 293-kilo (646-pound) Mekong giant catfish caught in Thailand in 2005, the US-funded Wonders of the Mekong research project said. The stingray, caught in Stung Treng province in northern Cambodia, was more than twice the weight of an average lowland gorilla, the experts said. ""In 20 years of researching giant fish in rivers and lakes on six continents, this is the largest freshwater fish that we've encountered or that's been documented anywhere worldwide,"" Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist leading the Wonders of the Mekong project, said in a statement released Tuesday. ""This is an absolutely astonishing discovery, and justifies efforts to better understand the mysteries surrounding this species and the incredible stretch of river where it lives."" The researchers fitted an acoustic tag to the stingray before returning it to the river, to try to learn more about the secretive creature's elusive behaviour. Last month, an endangered giant freshwater stingray four metres long and weighing 180 kilos was also hooked by a fisherman in the same province. More than 1,000 fish species call the Mekong home and the stingray is not the only giant lurking in the muddy waters -- the giant catfish and giant barb also reach up to three metres long and 270 kilos in weight. Scientists have warned that plastic waste threatens wildlife even in the deepest stretches of the Mekong, along with ""ghost nets"" -- abandoned by fishers but still able to snare fish. The famous waterway starts in China and twists south through parts of Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, feeding 60 million people through its basin and tributaries."
14,"Warren Buffett promised bulk of his fortune to Gates Foundation. Now, things could change: Report",trends," Warren Buffett has been one of the biggest donors to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation since 2006, when he pledged 85% of his stock in Berkshire Hathaway to charity, with the bulk of it going to the foundation run by his longtime friends. However, a report in the Wall Street Journal now indicates that the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway could redirect tens of billions of dollars to his family’s charity, rather than the Gates Foundation. In 2006, Warren Buffett promised to bequeath 85% of stock in his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, to the Gates Foundation. In a letter to Bill and Melinda Gates, the Oracle of Omaha wrote he was “irrevocably committing to make annual gifts of Berkshire Hathaway ‘B’ shares throughout my lifetime.” But more obscure was the wording on what would happen to undistributed shares in the event of Buffett’s death. The legendary investor is turning 92 this year. He has not publicly disclosed how his estate would be divided upon his death, but a report in the Journal indicates that Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, a little-known abortion-rights charity, is scrambling to make preparations in anticipation of a huge influx of funding. The Buffett family has been hiring administrative staff and planning to spend a massive amount of money it soon expects to receive. According to the report, foundation could receive as much as $70 to $100 billion. Buffett has pledged to leave $56 billion for the Gates Foundation, $17.4 billion to four family-linked charities including the Buffett Foundation, and an uncommitted sum of $18.7 billion. He stepped down as a trustee of the Gates Foundation last year. In his 15 years as a trustee, he donated close to $36 billion to the philanthropic organization. At a time when the subject of Buffett’s estate is being discussed, it is worth noting that earlier this year, the Gates Foundation removed a sentence from a press release which said that Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates would “devote the bulk of their remaining resources to the foundation.”"

16,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,trends," Equities jump highest in three weeks on relief rally, but rupee sinks India's benchmark stock gauges continued to recover on global cues, but the rupee hit a new low of 78.0825 against the dollar. The Sensex ended at 52,532 points, rising by 1.8 percent. The Nifty gained 1.9 percent to settle at 15,639 points. The rise was the biggest since May 30. Why it’s important: The sharp rise was a rebound from the sustained selloff in the past week or so. Market volatility is expected to remain. Increased crude oil prices have stoked fears of higher inflation and current account deficit in India, which sank the rupee.  Imports from Russia rise 3.5 times on increased crude oil purchases A significant rise in crude oil purchases has seen imports from Russia rise 3.5 times in the year in April to billion, commerce ministry data showed. In April, India’s imports of Russian crude were valued at $1.3 billion, 57 percent of the country’s inbound shipments from that country. Outbound shipments declined to $96 million in April, down by 59 percent year-on-year. Why it’s important: Sanctions-hit Russia sold crude oil at a discount to India, which moderated the country’s oil import bill to an extent as international prices soared since the Ukraine war. Russia has become India's second biggest oil supplier in May, overtaking Saudi Arabia.  Government extends concession period for logistics parks to attract investors The central government has extended the concession period for its scheme on multi-modal logistics parks from 30 to 45 years, which can potentially attract more long-term investors. The government plans to build 35 mega freight-and-transport hubs under its flagship Bharatmala scheme to smoothen freight mobility, improve efficiency and reduce logistics costs. Why it’s important: The longer concession period would help investors recoup their investment and generate surpluses. These gigantic parks are expected to reduce India’s high logistics cost of around 13-14 percent of GDP to single digits, as is the case in most advanced economies.  National Securities Depository in talks for IPO to raise Rs 4,500 crore National Securities Depository Ltd, India’s biggest depository services company, is in talks with investment banks for an IPO worth Rs 4,500 crore. Central Depository Services went public in 2017, raising Rs 524 crore in an IPO that was subscribed 170 times. Why it’s important: The plans to go public come at a time when opening of demat accounts has skyrocketed on account of a post-pandemic rally in the stock markets. The account openings could slow down due to current market volatility.  Edible oil prices cool as companies pass on benefits of lower input costs Retail prices of branded edible oil are declining as consumer goods firms pass on the gains from import duty cuts and cooling global prices. While Adani Wilmar, Patanjali, Mother Dairy and Emami Agrotech have cut prices, others are expected to introduce promotions to win back consumers lost to cheaper products. Why it’s important: Cheaper cooking oil will provide a much-needed relief for millions of households where budgets have been badly impacted due to persistently high inflation.  Export-focused SEZs could be allowed to sell products in domestic markets The Indian government is proposing to transform its export-focused special economic zones into economic hubs through several concessions and the easing of restrictions to attract more investment. Industrial units located in these hubs, which will be called Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs (DESH), may be allowed to sell in the domestic market, and contract manufacture for those outside these zones as well, according to a draft circulated for consultation. Why it’s important: It’s no secret that many units inside the country’s SEZs are ailing. An incentive to sell products in the local markets could see a reversal of their fortunes.  Foreign investors sell Rs 3 trillion worth of equities in nine months to June Foreign portfolio investors have pulled out $39 billion (about Rs 3 trillion) from Indian equities through the stock exchange route in the nine months to June, data from NSDL show. Their assets under management fell by 18. 6% to $531 billion at the end of the first fortnight of June, compared with $653 billion at the beginning of the year. InJune so far, FPIs have sold $5. 1 billion of Indian equities. Why it’s important: The capital outflow has reached a record because of high local valuations and India’s high sensitivity to crude oil imports. The rise in benchmark rates by the US Fed has added to the outbound momentum.  Duty corrections and easing of norms to feature in GST Council meeting The GST Council in its upcoming two-day meeting is likely to take up the fitment committee’s recommendations that propose raising rates on certain goods and services and pruning exemptions on a host of other items. The Council may also discuss adjusting and rectifying the inverted duty structure for certain items. It may extend the composition scheme to online sellers and exempt them from compulsory registration norms. Why it’s important: The exemption from compulsory registration would ensure parity between online and offline suppliers, providing a push to the ease of doing business, especially for small businesses.  Biocon Biologics in line of fire after allegations of bribing drugs controllers The Central Bureau of Investigation has alleged that senior officials of the Central Drugs Standards Control Organization colluded with pharmaceutical firm Biocon Biologics to waive the phase 3 clinical trial of the Insulin Aspart injection and manipulated the minutes of the subject expert committee meeting, causing substantial wrongful gain to Biocon Biologics. Why it’s important: Biocon has denied wrongdoing, but the charges have shone a spotlight on regulatory oversight on developing new medicines. The processes might need an overhaul to ensure better transparency.  Over Rs 10 trillion locked up in buyer payments to small businesses As much as Rs 10.7 trillion, nearly 6 percent of the gross value added of domestic businesses, is locked up annually as delayed payments from buyers to MSME suppliers, according to a report by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) India."

The photo, taken in February 1984, shows the astronaut in a white space suit floating in the void as the blue Earth's sphere looms under him. Perhaps the most-terrifying space photograph to date. Astronaut Bruce McCandless II floats completely untethered, away from the safety of the space shuttle, with nothing but his Manned Maneuvering Unit keeping him alive. The first person in history to do so.Credit: NASA pic.twitter.com/uapVOFwS2u  Describing the photo titled Free Floating, NASA stated in its website, ""Astronaut Bruce McCandless is seen floating above Earth. He is farther away from the safety of his spaceship than any astronaut had ever been."" ""This was made possible by a jet pack on his back called the Manned Maneuvering Unit, or MMU. McCandless tested the MMU near the space shuttle. He then went 'free-flying' to a distance of 320 feet away from the space shuttle."" According to a New York Times report, McCandless II was 170 mile (273.5 kilometre) above Earth’s surface when this photo was taken. In fact, The Times had described McCandless as “a puffy white gingerbread man” floating above the continental United States. While reflecting on the NASA photo, McCandless had in July 2015 told The Guardian, “My anonymity means people can imagine themselves doing the same thing. Like Neil (Armstrong) said in 1969, I was representing mankind up there.” McCandless, a former United States Navy captain, had played a role in Neil Armstrong's famed moonwalk three years later. “That may have been one small step for Neil, but it’s a heck of a big leap for me,” McCandless had joked earlier, in reference to comments Armstrong made after taking the first human step on the moon in 1969."

21,Why one of the world’s largest cruise ships is likely to be scrapped before maiden voyage,trends," What was meant to be the world’s largest cruise ships is now likely to be sold for scrap – even before it could sail on its maiden voyage. Global Dream II was being built by Dream Cruises, along with its sister vessel, Global Dream. The ship, which was being built to hold 9,000 passengers and over 2,000 crew, is currently sitting unfinished at a German shipyard, according to a report in The Guardian. Shipbuilder MV Werften, however, filed for bankruptcy after facing losses during the pandemic. Now, administrators can’t find a buyer for what would have been the largest cruise ship in the world in terms of capacity. In a press conference, Christoph Morgen, an insolvency administrator at Brinkmann & Partner, said the vessel's keel and lower hull will be sold for scrap. A report in German cruise industry magazine An Bord further said that Global Dream II’s engine and fixtures are also up for sale. Christoph Morgen announced during the press conference that the cruise ship needed to be moved out of MV Werften’s Wismar shipyard by the end of the year as the yard had been sold to a manufacturer of naval vessels which plans to build military vessels there. The naval unit has set a deadline for early 2024 for the ship to be moved."

1,"After 10 months of marriage, bride discovers her husband is actually a woman",trends," An Indonesian woman is claiming that she fell for a marriage scam after discovering her husband of 10 months is actually a female con artist. The woman shared her story on social media after her court case made national news in Indonesia. According to The Sun, this happened after the accused – identified by the initials AA – appeared before the Jambi District Court on Tuesday, June 14. The woman, who goes by the initials NA in court filings, claims that she was conned out of IDR 300 million (around Rs 15 lakh) after she matched with the scammer on a dating app in May 2021. AA allegedly claimed to be a US-trained surgeon and coal businessman. The two entered into a relationship and got married three months later in a nikah siri ceremony, which literally translates to secret wedding. Such marriages are not legally registered but recognised by religion. The two could not have a state-sanctioned wedding because AA could not produce the documents required. The newlyweds lived in the house of NA’s parents for several months after the wedding. However, the bride’s parents soon became suspicious because AA could not produce any proof of being a businessman or a surgeon, and kept asking them for money. Meanwhile, AA’s friends and family backed his claims, as if they were in on the scam. To avoid suspicion, AA took NA to Lahat, South Sumatra, after a few months, where she was then locked into a house and prohibited from interacting with anyone, reports Coconuts Jakarta. NA says her ‘husband’ controlled her finances and even attempted to murder her by asking her to jump into a river, knowing full well she did not know how to swim. In April, NA’s mother and Jambi Police managed to track the couple down. What followed has since made global headlines. During the police interview, AA was revealed to be a woman – more specifically a female con artist who goes by the initials EY. On social media, NA reportedly addressed a common query she kept receiving, claiming that her ‘husband’ always turned the lights off and blindfolded her before sex."
2,The New Path to the C-Suite: CPA Program,trends," Varun Sareen CPA (Aust.), Vice President Finance at GreyOrange, a warehouse automation company, has more than twenty years of technical and functional experience in the world of finance. Keen to take the next step in his career, Varun began considering what more he could do to position himself better from an international point of view. “I came to know about the CPA Australia program from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India’s email that they are holding a joint session together just to make the members aware about this program and Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA),” says Varun. As one of the world’s largest professional accounting bodies, CPA Australia positions its over 170,000 members in a global network. Having contacts with other members working in 100 countries and regions across the globe makes it easier to create an international career. Spearheading innovation in business CPA Australia ensures that future business leaders are well supported in their learning journey and develop an innovative mindset to deal with challenges in the world of business. In his current role at GreyOrange, Varun is responsible for the finance strategy and accounting operations for its global business. In order to better understand cutting-edge innovative methodologies relevant to his role, Varun undertook the CPA Program. One topic during the course, business model innovation, was of particular interest to Varun. “I’d studied this topic before but just the refresher and going through the topics again and reading about it was very interesting for me.” During his professional journey while working on the process of a business transformation within his own organisation, Varun worked towards reshaping the workforce. “I had to work hard to decentralise decision-making and introduce specialisation of roles. This change towards creating an agile team was not easy as I encountered cultural challenges I navigated through those times by acting as a role model, opening the channels for frequent and regular communication and rewarding behaviors that supported the change.” “I also worked closely with the internal IT and risk control team to mitigate risks related to confidentiality of data, and compliance framework. Successfully leading through the innovation, resulted in improving the customer net promoter score and faster cash collection.” By utilising his knowledge gained from the CPA Australia program, Varun has successfully enhanced the vision and mission statement of GreyOrange. Varun believes the CPA Program has given him practical frameworks to improve the process in his role. “I have been able to apply the balanced scorecard technique to ensure we have a robust and wholesome method to measure performance for the organisation and the functional teams covering the financial perspective, the customer perspective, the internal process perspective as well as the learning and growth perspective,” says Varun. Stepping stone to a leadership position Before choosing CPA Australia, Varun explored a few alternatives and it was the course subject Global Strategy and Leadership that he previewed on CPA’s website that made him excited. “For me personally, I was looking at something from a leadership, strategy standpoint that will help me grow in my career as well. The CPA Program fitted well and that's why I chose it,” explains Varun. Another factor in this course’s favour for Varun was that it was practical and accessible for a fulltime worker like he was. “The course was also easy to pursue because this program was fully online. The pandemic also helped me to make the decision because travel was difficult and there weren’t many options available for candidates like me who are in the Asia pacific region and couldn’t travel to Australia to take an exam.” Varun achieved a high distinction in the subject and found that working through the course at regular intervals helped him fall into a habit that worked really well for him. “As a working professional it might look tough to manage between work and study when you first see the course material. Sometimes just opening a book and reading can become monotonous but the CPA course material is very helpful with videos for this program shared on their website, which made it easy for me.”  "
3,Dead woman in Russia partially ‘eaten by her 20 cats'. Police discovered body after 2 weeks,trends," A woman in Russia has been partially eaten by her 20 cats after she died at home. The police discovered the body two weeks later after receiving a complaint by the woman's co-worker. The woman, whose identity has not been revealed, was a cat breeder who owned 20 Maine Coon cats. These cats are an extremely popular large domestic breed which originated in the US state of Maine. They are known for their muscular build, passive nature and is often called as ""the gentle giant"". The incident happened in the Russian city of Bataysk and it came to light after the police received a concerned phone call by the woman's colleague, The Sun reported. The police said that the woman had been dead for two weeks after she collapsed and her pet cats survived all this while by partially eating their owner’s body. They had found the partially eaten body surrounded by the hungry cats. An animal rescue expert who took the cats under her care said that their actions were “understandable”, the publication reported. “The cats were left alone on their own for two weeks, there was no food, so what else to eat?"" she said. ""It's understandable right? They ate what there was."" While a few of the healthier cats have been rehomed, it’s unclear whether the new owners are aware of what happened. This, however, is not the only incident of its kind. A woman in England's Hampshire was found half eaten by her pet cats, after her body remained undiscovered for two months, reported The Standard."

Airline responds",trends," An IndiGo flyer has claimed that during a recent flight, the cabin crew refused food to his six-year-old daughter because they had to serve the corporate clients first. The child cried throughout the flight, he added. The great @IndiGo6E experience : My 6yo kid was #hungry. Requested cabin crew to give her any food available, willing to pay for it. On repeated requests also they #refused saying they will serve corporate clients first. She kept crying whole flight but they didn’t serve  While Moneycontrol could not independently verify the claim, responding to the tweet, an IndiGo representative commented, ""Sir, we understand what you must have gone through.

We apologise for such an experience and have shared your feedback with the concerned team for a further review so as to avoid recurrences. We look forward to serving you better in future."" Twitter users, however, were divided over the incident. A section of them blamed the parent for flying without carrying food with them. ""As a parent of a six-year-old, first of all it is your duty to carry food with you. So blame your carelessness first. Agreed, the airline could have acted promptly. So first say that 'I as the parent of a six-year-old kid's parent didn't bring food and was expecting the airlines to serve me first,"" wrote Twitter user Kamal Raj (@KamalRajbharat). Another user Sangeetha (@sangeeetha_) said, ""What are parents for if not to look out for needs of children? So you will not stock up for needs of a six-year-old and depend upon airlines?

6,Hong Kong's iconic Jumbo floating restaurant sinks in South China Sea,trends," Jumbo floating restaurant, a once famed but financially struggling Hong Kong tourist attraction, sank in the South China Sea after being towed away from the city, its parent company said Monday. It capsized on Sunday near the Paracel Islands after it ""encountered adverse conditions"" and began to take on water, Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises announced in a statement. ""The water depth at the scene is over 1,000 meters, making it extremely difficult to carry out salvage works,"" it added. The company said it was ""very saddened by the incident"" but that no crew members were injured. It said marine engineers had been hired to inspect the floating restaurant and install hoardings on the vessel before the trip, and that ""all relevant approvals"" had been obtained. The restaurant closed in March 2020, citing the Covid-19 pandemic as the final straw after almost a decade of financial woes. Operator Melco International Development said last month the business had not been profitable since 2013 and cumulative losses had exceeded HK$100 million ($12.7 million). It was still costing millions in maintenance fees every year and around a dozen businesses and organisations had declined an invitation to take it over at no charge, Melco added. It announced last month that ahead of its licence expiration in June, Jumbo would leave Hong Kong and await a new operator at an undisclosed location. The restaurant set off shortly before noon last Tuesday from the southern Hong Kong Island typhoon shelter where it had sat for nearly half a century. Opened in 1976 by the late casino tycoon Stanley Ho, in its glory days it embodied the height of luxury, reportedly costing more than HK$30 million to build. Designed like a Chinese imperial palace and once considered a must-see landmark, the restaurant drew visitors from Queen Elizabeth II to Tom Cruise. It also featured in several films -- including Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"", about a deadly global pandemic. Jumbo's departure from Hong Kong was met with regret and nostalgia from many Hong Kong residents. Some online commentators described pictures of the floating palace sailing across a charcoal grey ocean towards the horizon as a metaphor for Hong Kong's future."
7,"World Music Day: History, significance, greetings and quotes",trends," World Music Day is celebrated annually on June 21. This day was first celebrated as Fete de la Musique in France in 1982. Since then, World Music Day has taken on a special significance worldwide. It’s a day when people come out on the streets with music instruments, when free public concerts are organised and the melodious notes ring from parks and public spaces. Today, World Music Day also sees promotional offers from music labels, sound system companies, streaming services and more. History and significance of World Music Day World Music Day was organised by Jack Lang in 1982, who was then French Culture Minister, and Maurice Fleuret, Director of Music and Dance at the French Ministry of Culture. Together, the two started Fête de la Musique (festival of music) on the streets of Paris. The idea behind this celebration was to gather both amateur and professional musicians on the streets to celebrate the beauty of music. Later on, other nations also adopted this practice of street concerts to celebrate music. In 1997, a charter was signed at the European Festival of Music in Budapest to recognise June 21 as World Music Day. Since then, it has been celebrated in countries like Italy, Belgium, India, Greece, UK, Japan and many more. The aim of World Music Day is to provide a platform to both professional musicians and budding talent, and to make music accessible to the public. Quotes, greetings and messages to share on World Music Day “One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.” ― Bob Marley “If music be the food of love, play on.” – William Shakespeare “I live my daydreams in music, I see my life in terms of music.” – Albert Einstein “Where words fail, music speaks.” — Hans Christian Andersen “Music is the universal language of mankind.” ― Henry Wadsworth Longfellow “Music is healing. Music holds things together.” ― Prince"

9,"Interview | Virtual reality has the capacity to transform learning outcomes for medical students: Adith Chinnaswami, co-founder, MediSim VR ",trends," Adith Chinnaswami is a surgeon by training who, along with two partners, set up India’s first fully automated Virtual Reality (VR) lab in the Puducherry Institute of Medical Sciences for MBBS students to learn key medical skills and patient diagnosis in VR. MediSim VR started at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras- HealthTech Incubator with the aim of transforming medical skill training in India using futuristic technologies. Its patented technology helps healthcare professionals to develop essential skills virtual patients and situational training modules. With continued research on haptics (the perception of objects by touch and proprioception, or the sense of self-movement, force, and body position), MediSim VR is also the first Indian entity to become a resident company of Johnson & Johnson Innovation Labs, Boston. In this conversation with Moneycontrol, Chinnaswami talks about the role of VR in medical colleges and the company’s future plans. Edited excerpts: How does virtual reality in medical colleges work and how is it beneficial for students? VR technology has many applications in the medical field. The main use, you can say, for virtual reality is always going to be training-oriented. This is the area with the maximum focus right now because it sets this gold standard in terms of simulation experiences. And the medical fraternity as a whole has started focusing on giving students immersive training. So this basically entails simulation-based training, to teach them skills rather than the academic curriculum, and that is where VR is going to play a major role. There are also various other uses, such as continuing to learn academic content through VR. There are a lot of studies which have shown that there are much greater involvement rates meaning that when VR is being used, there is a significant improvement in learning outcomes; one such study has been conducted by Harvard University. So for VR, the biggest area of application would always be skill training, followed by academic uses as well. Also read I Explained | Poliovirus detected in sewage water in Kolkata: how worried should we be? How did the setting up of the company come about? I completed my Masters in 2017 and followed up with my fellowship in minimal access surgery. So, that was when I started doing some research into surgical simulation, simulation-based training and what the training solutions currently available were. At this point, I met my business partners Sabarish Chandrasekaran and Jeno Manickam Durairaj, who were already into VR. And once we started talking, I realized that the talent they had could easily be used to address the problems facing medical education and training. So we put in some research in terms of seeing how well we could translate the skill set into the medical field because the accuracy and the finesse required for medical simulation is a lot more when compared to any other industry. So once we nailed our research, targets and milestones, we were very confident we could achieve what we were trying to do. And that’s when we decided to incorporate. So we started as a registered company in India and subsequently gateways opened at IIT-Madras, followed by Johnson and Johnson Innovation Labs in Boston. This meant that we could also set up a US entity as well. So, we now have a presence in the US and India and we are now a global company. Can you also tell us how the training of medical students is different using VR? Current-day scenario is that students are not really getting trained adequately, it can be due to a multitude of reasons. One, the most important thing is that the previous generation of technology, which is the mannequins, was not built to cater to high volume centres, which means students often tend to observe it and then directly go start practicing it on patients and then learn by making mistakes. This is something which was acceptable as a general consensus for a long period of time, but now we are waking up to the fact that once there is a way to safeguard the patient’s interest by making sure they train ahead, that is no longer acceptable. And I think that’s where VR plays a major role, students will start learning all their basic essential patient-facing skills on the VR systems. Even before they start approaching a mannequin or a patient, they will be well prepared in terms of what to expect. So they will have access to a skilled training module set out as part of their curriculum during various years. We are currently focusing on pre-final and final years. And subsequently, when they get to internship, they will have a good amount of confidence and knowledge about the skills which they are about to execute on a patient. And that will be the crux of using VR. The biggest advantage of using VR, I would say, is competency assessment, those which are built in. So students often, when they are learning with mannequins, they may pick up a wrong habit, a wrong way of doing something that essentially will never get corrected unless or until it causes a big mishap. With our system, the student will now know when he is doing something right or when he is doing something wrong. And eventually the institution can assess the competency of students and make sure they attain a certifiable level of competency before they allow a student to graduate. And I think this will give further confidence to the user base as well that they know something well enough. And patients tend to trust doctors a lot more when they are well trained and confident in what they are doing. I think that is going to make all the difference in terms of their perspective. Also read I India’s largest private hospital in Faridabad looks at a launch date this August What are the expansion plans of MediSim VR for medical colleges? So currently, like I mentioned, we are targeting the pre-final and final years of MBBS degree. Moving forward within the end of this year, we will have content for the first and the second years as well. We are also looking to launch content for nursing and allied health professionals. So in terms of this, content is almost ready. We are looking to tie up with the right partners and work on that field. And we expect to have some announcements very soon. So we will expand to not just the medical fraternity but the entire healthcare fraternity. And of course, regional expansion is next on the radar. We have essentially been South Indian. We have focused on our local market, but we do want to start opening up to all regions across the country. And we already have a US partner base but we have inbound interest from Southeast Asian countries. Other than all of this, I think the major thing we are also looking for is to eventually move into the clinical side of things as VR has a lot of applications in terms of getting used in therapy, in vocational counselling, phobia management, and pain management. And that’s an area where we have been putting in a lot of research over the last few months and we hope to enter the market with a product in that space as well. There has been a sort of boom in the medical technology field in India and now there are so many firms operating in the space. How are you different from others? I think MedTech is a huge, a very general term, and it encompasses a very huge array of industries. But the advantage we would have is that we are essentially placed at the overlap of – if you were to draw a Venn diagram with say MedTech, EdTech and medical, I would say we would be at the cross section of all of these three fields and that gives us the edge. Through our collaborations with partners and Johnson and Johnson, we are making sure that the quality of what we bring in is also matching global standards, the highest possible level in terms of the quality of the product, and making sure that it’s something which is adoptable by the Indian industry as well. In the medical field, we often tend to need to wait a long time before the benefits of technology are eventually brought down to Indian affordability levels. But since our base is here and that is where our roots are we made sure like right from day one we want our product to be something which the Indian user or the Indian patient will actually benefit from."
10,Alliance Air denies boarding to award-winning artist over battery-run wheelchair,trends," An award-winning physically challenged artist has claimed she was prohibited from boarding an Alliance Air flight from Bengaluru to Kochi recently as she was not willing to leave behind her battery-operated wheelchair. The only option the airline provided to Sarita Dwivedi was -- leave behind her wheelchair or book a flight on another airline, she claimed while talking to PTI on Monday. Alliance Air did not even refund the amount of around Rs 8,000 she had spent on the tickets for herself and her friend who had come from Kochi to Bengaluru to take her here. She also accused a staff member of hostile behaviour towards her. Hi Ms. Dwivedi,We regret the inconvenience caused. The concerned team is looking into the matter and will update at the earliest. Kindly accept our assurance that this information will be taken into account and used in our constant endeavor to improve our services. Dwivedi said she had to subsequently shell out around Rs 14,000 for travelling on another private carrier to reach here along with her friend. The airline also carried her wheelchair in the plane's cargo without any hitch, she said. However, what transpired at the Alliance Air counter at Kempegowda International Airport on Saturday was a very bad experience, she said. On being asked whether she plans to sue the airline or take any other action, she said she was not sure how to go about that. Giving details of her ordeal, Dwivedi said she reached the check-in counter around 8 am, an hour ahead of the flight's departure, conforming to the one-hour rule. ""On seeing me, the first thing the person from the airline said was that if you are travelling with a motorised wheelchair, you should come a little early. Then I got little angry and said I was on time. I told him to get the scanning person to scan the wheelchair so that I can go. Again he said I was late. Then he said 'madam you cannot travel with the motorised wheelchair as it was battery operated'."" On being asked whether the airline official gave a reason for not allowing the wheelchair, she stated ""they said there are certain guidelines against it. But these guidelines are there with every airline."" ""They said that in view of the guidelines, I cannot take my wheelchair. So either I should leave it behind or I cannot travel on the flight. That is how they were talking to me. I felt so bad,"" she said. She had earlier tweeted about the incident, tagging Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiradita Scindia. Asked if the airline offered any alternatives, she said, ""They were not willing to do anything for me. I was ready to leave the wheelchair there, provided they could send it to my place in Kochi. I am not from Bangalore. I am a humble person. I did not want to argue, so I asked them what they can do to help me,"" she said. They said they cannot do anything but can refund her ticket amount. However, ""they have not refunded the ticket amount.. I had spent around Rs 8,000 on two tickets for myself and my friend.. even my friend could not travel as I was not allowed to travel. Not only did they not refund the amount, I had to, thereafter, spend around Rs 14,000 on two tickets to Kochi on another airline,"" she claimed. Dwivedi reached Kochi on Saturday afternoon instead of the morning as she had originally planned. When asked whether Alliance Air has got in touch with her subsequently to refund the amount, Dwivedi said, ""Nothing. They have no facilities. They do not know how to talk to people. They just keep arguing and shouting. It was irritating."" She claimed initially the airline did not allow them to get their boarding passes and then they said that their manager was coming and to wait for him as after he arrives, then only they can do anything. After a long wait, a person came who was a senior supervisor in Alliance Air and not the manager. ""So I asked the person at the counter who had stopped me from boarding earlier as to whether this was the same person he spoke about. But he did not give a proper response."" She said the man started shouting at her that he was the responsible person and that he would be taking the decisions in the absence of the manager who was not here. Dwivedi said she asked him why she was made to wait so long at the airport, if the manager was not going to come. ""I, thereafter, calmly asked them to send me to Kochi. I said I do not want a refund... they said we cannot do that and that I can get a refund only. They said I should book a flight on another airline. That is how they replied. Then they said that I could travel by their airline, but the wheelchair cannot be taken along,"" she added. For Dwivedi who had travelled the long distance from Indiranagar in Bangalore to the airport, everything had been ""spoiled"" by then and she subsequently demanded that the airline gave in writing why she was not allowed to board her flight. @JM_Scindia Dear Sir, Need help regarding @allianceair behaviour. I am Divyang travel with my Motorized Wheelchair but stuck at Bangalore airport since @allianceair not allowing me to board in my flight alongwith my wheelchair. Missed my flight. #RPWD Act 2016 pic.twitter.com/GGvTJqZXMT   ""After travelling so far alone and managing everything physically, mentally and financially, they spoiled everything for me. For a person like me it is difficult. It is in my nature that I speak softly to people and I was speaking calmly to them at the airport to find a solution. They are the ones who started arguing and then shouting at me,"" she alleged. Personnel of the Airports Authority of India were present there and provided her with food and water and comforted her. They even tried to reason with the airline official, but in vain. ""So then I asked him to give me in writing why I missed my flight, why I was not allowed to board,"" she said. Thereafter, for the sake of formality the official wrote down why she was not allowed to board and she also agreed to get a refund to book tickets on another flight as she was getting late, Dwivedi said. However, when the official realised she was going to fly on another airline, he said he would not give anything in writing and walked away with the paper, she claimed. On how the experience was with the other carrier she later flew in, she said, ""They never created any issue for me. They were quick and gave a very good service. My wheelchair has a dry battery. The rule is that you cannot travel with a wet battery on an airline."" ""I just removed the battery supply and gave it to the airline and they put the wheelchair in the baggage,"" she said. ""I travel a lot and wherever I go, I have never faced this problem. This time the travel agent booked the tickets on Alliance Air. He did not mention that I was differently abled or wheelchair user while booking the ticket. That is required if I need a wheelchair. But I carry my own wheelchair, so where is the need to put that (while booking a ticket)?"""
11,Elon Musk’s daughter files for name change: I ‘no longer wish to be related’ to him,trends," One of Elon Musk’s children wants to ditch his powerful last name. Xavier Alexander Musk, born male, has filed to change their name legally to reflect their new gender identity as a female. TMZ reported that Elon Musk’s trans daughter, who was formerly known as Xavier Musk, filed documents in LA County to change her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson a day after her 18th birthday in April. The documents state the reason for the name change as “Gender Identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” Vivian is ditching the Musk surname in favour of ‘Wilson’, which is her mother Justine’s last name. Justine Wilson and Elon Musk were married from 2000 to 2008. Their first son, Nevada, was born in 2002 and died at the age of 10 weeks of sudden infant death syndrome. Vivian and her twin Griffin, born in 2004, are the eldest of the Tesla chief’s seven children. TMZ reported that “neither Elon or Vivian has previously said anything publicly about their relationship or her transition.” It is worth noting that Elon Musk, in July 2020, tweeted “Pronouns suck.”"
12,"Meet Captain Monica Khanna, who safely landed SpiceJet flight after engine fire",trends," Captain Monica Khanna’s quick-thinking saved the lives of around 185 passengers on board the SpiceJet flight that caught fire shortly after takeoff on Sunday. The Delhi-bound SpiceJet flight safely returned to Patna after cabin crew noticed sparks flying out of the left engine of the aircraft and alerted the pilots. Captain Monica Khanna – the pilot in-charge – acted calmly and took control of the situation. After consulting with First Officer Balpreet Singh Bhatia, she switched off the affected engine and landed the ‘overweight’ aircraft skillfully in Patna. Her quick-thinking and prompt action saved the lives of around 185 passengers and crew on board the flight. A senior SpiceJet official lauded the pilots who made the emergency landing after being alerted to the engine fire, which was reportedly caused by a bird hit.  “Captain Monica Khanna and first officer Balpreet Singh Bhatia conducted themselves well during the incident. They were calm throughout, and handled the aircraft well,” Gurcharan Arora, SpiceJet's chief of flight operations, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. ""Only a single engine was functioning when the plane landed back. Engineers inspected the aircraft, and confirmed that a fan blade and engine were damaged as a bird hit. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will probe further,” Arora further said. Fire Visual From Inside Spicejet Plane.#SpiceJet pic.twitter.com/fbZuiVyB1p"
13,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,trends," India faces twin deficit problem due to rising subsidies, commodity prices Higher commodity prices and rising subsidy burden are leading to an increase in both fiscal and current account deficits, the finance ministry has warned. As government revenues take a hit after cuts in fuel levies, an upside risk to fiscal deficit has emerged. The increase may cause the current account deficit to widen, compounding the effects of costlier imports, and weaken the value of the rupee. Why it’s important: It is the first time the government has admitted the possibility of fiscal slippage in the current financial year. The government, however, maintains that India faces low risk of stagflation.  India may allow life insurance companies to sell health cover India’s insurance regulator is planning to allow life insurance companies to offer full-fledged health insurance policies. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India is likely to issue draft guidelines allowing life insurers to sell indemnity health insurance products, commonly known as mediclaim policies. Why it’s important: The move will increase competition and has the potential to reduce premiums and increase access to affordable health cover.  Payments firms complain that banks are not sharing infrastructure subsidies Payments companies and banks fighting over the sharing of government-granted subsidies for building payment infrastructure. The payments firms have told the National Payments Corporation of India that Rs 700 crore of the Rs 1,500 crore granted in the budget is being retained by banks. This has deprived companies connecting up the last mile of state-promised revenues. Why it’s important: The government provided the subsidies in exchange for waiving charges related to the merchant discount rate. The Reserve Bank is expected to carry out a comprehensive review of all aspects related to charges in digital transactions.  Margins still under pressure at FMCG companies despite cooling input costs Packaged consumer goods makers are unlikely to slash prices despite the correction in crude and palm oil prices but will instead slow the pace of price increases. Palm oil has dropped below $1,300 per ton from $1,900 while crude oil has retreated to less than $107 a barrel from a peak of $130. These together account for more than half of companies' input costs. Why it’s important: FMCG companies did not earlier pass on the full burden of increased input costs to consumers, fearing a weakening in demand. There is no indication that demand has revived.  Air India considers purchasing 300 aircraft to revamp fleet Air India may buy 300 Airbus SE’s A320neo or Boeing Co.’s 737 Max aircraft to revamp its fleet. A deal for 300 737 Max-10 jets could be worth $40.5 billion at sticker prices, although discounts are common in such large purchases. Production and delivery of 300 planes would likely take years or even more than a decade. Why it’s important: The purchase could be one of the largest in commercial aviation history as the former state-run airline looks to overhaul its fleet under new ownership by the Tata group.  Yes Bank in talks to raise $1 billion from Carlyle, Advent Yes Bank is in advanced negotiations to raise $1 billion in equity from Carlyle and Advent International. The talks picked up pace after the lender decided to partner with JC Flowers to offload most of the bad loans on its books. It may take some more time as it is seeking shareholder approval for a new board of directors. Why it’s important: Yes Bank has been trying to dig its way out of trouble by recapitalising. It has started exiting the reconstruction scheme set up two years ago after the government and the Reserve Bank put in place a special plan to rescue the private sector lender.  Vedanta offers to sell shuttered Sterlite copper smelter in Tamil Nadu Oil-to-metals conglomerate Vedanta has offered to sell a copper smelter complex in southern Tamil Nadu that was closed four years ago. Prospective buyers have until 4 July to submit expressions of interest. The smelter in Thoothukudi was ordered shut in May 2018 after an agitation for closure for alleged pollution. Why it’s important: The chances of reopening the factory look slim as the matter of closure is in the courts. It is unclear who would be interested in buying the facility.  Private banks charging high foreclosure fees, small businesses say An association representing nearly two million small enterprises in India has accused top private banks of levying steep charges to foreclose their loans. Hidden charges levied by banks are putting severe pressure on working capital, said Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises. Why it’s important: The levies charged to close a loan before its tenure comes at a time many small enterprises in the country are facing severe input pressures on rising commodity prices.  Indian companies face sharp increase in funding costs as rate cycle reverses After two years of a record low interest-rate regime, Indian corporate houses are experiencing a sharp and abrupt increase in funding costs. The yield on the benchmark triple-A-rated corporate bonds maturing in three years has climbed 0.98 percentage point since the policy rate hike in May. A significant portion of corporate borrowing is conducted in papers maturing in three to five years. Why it’s important: The easy money cycle has ended due to persistently high inflation. Borrowing costs will only rise from here on in the foreseeable future.  Corporates welcome new military recruitment scheme despite protests Corporate India has gone out of its way to support the central government on its Agnipath military recruitment scheme, which has triggered a mass agitation across India. Top business leaders, including N Chandrasekaran, Anand Mahindra, Harsh Goenka, Sanjiv Bajaj and Kiran Majumdar-Shaw, felt the soldiers who will not be retained after four years would find employment in the private sector."
14,World Music Day 2022 | Original music on OTT gets a thumbs up,trends," Music can bring people together, regardless of nationality, race, language or geographical boundaries. And World Music Day celebrates this. Fête de la Musique, Make Music Day or International Music Day is celebrated in over 120 countries worldwide. France's culture minister Jack Lang came up with this idea back in 1981, and since June 21, 1982, summer solstice, it’s been celebrated annually. With digital concerts, self-published music that doesn't depend on music labels, and the rise of music in the OTT sphere, the music scenario in our country has changed drastically in the last few years. OTT music is a genre by itself If you’ve binged on Game Of Thrones on Amazon Prime/Disney+Hotstar, chances are that you’ve ended up humming the theme tune. Indian viewers have grown up appreciating music in our movies and shows, and with the phenomenal rise in long-form OTT content, this has only grown. There have been multiple shows in the last couple of years where platforms have used original, exclusive music. Gautam Talwar, Chief Content Officer, MX Player, says: “We have always given importance to original music scores from the very first series we launched called Hey Prabhu. The show had original songs specifically written for it. This practice is followed even today. Be it songs for hit shows like Aashram or Matsyakaand, or even shows that are in production like Chotte Yaadav, which has original songs composed by none other than the Indian Ocean, we believe that original music is a key to storytelling, and we invest appropriately in creating original tracks for almost all our original shows.” Singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad who has composed for Netflix’s Mismatched and Ajeeb Daastaans, puts a lot of thought into the music he creates for OTT platforms. So, what does he look for in a project when he says yes to it? “I like to do music that I can do justice to, so if I feel like a song needs to be written in a space that I feel confident operating in - whether lyrically or sound wise, I’m usually happy to do it. I also need to feel good about the project and the script overall.” Kuhad had also composed music for Pause, and Little Things season 2.  In 2019, Sony Music Entertainment released the Original Series Soundtrack of Amazon Prime’s Made in Heaven that was composed by Sagar Desai. It had six songs by Rituraj Mohanty, Vibha Saraf, and Farhad Bhiwandiwala. For ‘Roshay’, sung by Vibha, producer Dub Sharma used ambient folk instrumentals, while the song ‘Musafir’ had a danceable beat.  ‘Aa Re Sakhi More Piya Ghar Aaye’, a qawwali by M.S. Nizami Brothers, and the song ‘Perfect Love’ had a light-hearted composition and these are a few examples of originals in OTT series.  Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's (SEL's) music, a mix of peppy pop numbers, instrumental, folk and pristine Hindustani classical in Bandish Bandits was the core of the show and they spent two years composing for it. The composer trio were pumped at the idea that a web series could give one so many variations and so much scope to explore.  Big names like SEL and others from the Bollywood music industry often work in the OTT sphere now. Composers Sachin-Jigar created music for Amazon Prime’s The Family Man Season 2 and composer Amit Trivedi worked on Disney+Hotstar’s Grahan, 'Divine' in Netflix’s Sacred Games.  These days most shows have music as an integral component of storytelling. Most creative heads at OTT platforms believe that original music is a narrative requirement in storytelling and hence, it is critical to partner with the right music composer for your respective shows. MX Player's Talwar says they are working with new talent and upcoming musicians as well. “Vaibhav Bundhoo, a newbie, scored some beautiful melodies for our show Campus Diaries. We... produced a full-fledged music show called Times of Music that not only won us the Filmfare but also the Asian Academy Awards. We had legends like Pyarelalji (Laxmikant Pyarelal fame), Anandji (Kalyanji Anandji fame), Viju Shah, Bappi Lahiri to name a few, reimagining songs for contemporary artists like Vishal-Shekhar, Salim-Sulieman, Sachin-Jigar, Ajay-Atul... We are fully invested in creating original songs for our shows as we believe it’s integral to storytelling,” he adds.  Zee 5's Broken But Beautiful Season 2, had an album of four original songs sung by popular singers Anusha Mani, Armaan Malik, Akhil Sachdeva and Vishal Mishra. The melodious love song 'Shaamein' written by Manoj Muntashir, composed by Amaal Mallik and sung by Armaan Malik was much appreciated. Title tracks of Mirzapur, Scam 1992, songs in Shershaah, Ludo, Atrangi Re, Pagglait, Mimi, Minnal Murali have stood out and found a place in not just playlists but popularity charts as well."
15,Funnycontrol | International Yoga Day 2022: Market crash asanas,trends," Dear Funnycontrollers, Happy Yoga Day! I am sure you have all learnt to stretch your budgets just like you stretch your limbs to combat inflation. Today, we will learn a few special asanas to make you Fiscally fit. Remember, just because the market is crashing, doesn’t mean your paunch must also hit the floor. Ignore asana: For this asana, you must lift your left hand and place it over your left ear, then lift your right hand and place it over your right ear. And firmly keep out all the speaking voices on business news channels. The ones that asked you to buy have already sold. The ones who told you to hold have now left you holding the bag. But it’s ok, in these inflationary times, at least you have a bag. Side-kick asana: For this asana, you must balance on one leg, lift the other at a 70-degree angle and deliver a side-kick to that friend who told you to “get into crypto, bro”. For better results, you must also yell: “Dodge this you dodgecoin peddler.” This will allow the asana to come from the angst you have been feeling from seeing your bank account dip below the minimum balance. It is then that you realize you should have balanced your maximum a long time ago. Powell muktasan: This is an asana recommended for US lawmakers when they look to hire the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. ESG asana: When all else fails, tell yourself that even though the companies you invested in were not sustainable, at least they helped the environment. With no more offices to consume electricity, and employees to consume precious company resources, you can smugly do the ESG asana while staring at the red in your personal balance sheet. Now lift your left hand up to your forehead and give yourself a laal salaam. National spiritual asana: For spiritual inspiration in the financial markets, who better than the former CEO of the National Spiritual Exchange of India. She was connected to the spiritual guru of the markets who even invited her to Seychelles for a spiritual yoga retreat. For this asana, you must acquire shares of the Spiritual Exchange and chant “Rig Yajur Sama” for 75 basis points. 75 basis asana: For this asana, you must do 75 namaskars in front of the Federal Reserve building in the US and ask them to not repeat the 75 basis point hike. If they refuse, you must threaten to do 150 namaskars and remind them that you are not Malaika Arora. Funnycontrol Asana: This is the toughest asana in the set. And really in these inflationary times, a 75 basis point hike in the writing rate is surely warranted and should be linked to the CPI – Comedy Price Index. In this asana you must take the ups and downs of the markets to be as  natural as the ups and downs of your torso as you breathe. And you must laugh away all the stresses and strains of managing an investment portfolio. And making memes. And hope one of those memes goes on to become a famous NFT. And you are able to stick it to the next fool, making up all your portfolio losses. But when it all comes crashing down, just remember to stay out of the way of his side-kick asana."

17,"Singles in Japan give online dating a miss, write letters to find 'the one'",trends," If you are sick of swiping and trying to find your perfect match on dating sites and apps, a Japanese city's new and successful matchmaking scheme may have the answer for you -- write letters. Singles in southern Japan's Miyazaki are being encouraged to put pen to paper in a low-tech search for their soulmate, part of municipal efforts to boost the low birth rate. The charm of handwritten correspondence has attracted so many young residents that organisers have decided to expand the Miyazaki Koibumi (Miyazaki love letter) programme to other areas. Compared to online dating, ""it takes longer, and inspires you to imagine the person you're in communication with,"" said Rie Miyata, head of a local consulting firm commissioned to run the scheme. ""It's less about how good your penmanship is,"" she told AFP, ""and more the fact that you write every single character sincerely and with care, thinking deeply about the person you're writing to."" ""That's what makes letters so powerful,"" she said. Since 2020, when the project began, 450 people have signed up -- more than double authorities' initial estimates -- with around 70 percent in their 20s and 30s.  To participate, members must first register on an official website and add information about themselves such as their hobbies, favourite films, books, sports, and the age of the person they would want to exchange letters with. The letter exchange management office then selects and matches two people who seem compatible based on the registered information. If both parties agree, they can communicate through the office, Japan's The Mainichi had reported. One of the Miyazaki Koibumi project's distinctive feature is that the letters are dropped in to a yellow postbox that is said to bring happiness. But unlike dating apps, the only thing revealed about each new pen pal is their age, with identifying details like their full name, job and address withheld -- and of course, no profile pics on display. ""Looks are often a decisive factor"" when searching for a partner, ""but in letters, you are judged by your personality,"" Miyata said. Letters are posted to the organisers, who give them a quick read to make sure the note contains no obscenities or insults before sending it on to the eager recipient. There are, however, rules that members have to follow. They can write letters of up to two sheets on designated paper. A pair can send and receive letters up to five times without revealing their name or home address. If both parties wish to meet face to face, operators take care when exchanging contact information. After that, it is left up to the members, the Japanese publication had reported. So far, 32 pairs have set up face-to-face meetings, with romance blooming for 17 couples who have started a relationship. One participant, a 25-year-old Miyazaki resident, said the idea had brought back fond memories. ""As a kid, I used to write letters to the girl I had a crush on,"" the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told AFP. ""I like how old-fashioned letters are. That made me want to join the programme."" Despite the city's original approach, it's not unusual for local governments to fund matchmaking programmes in Japan, which has the world's oldest population and one of the lowest fertility rates. In 2021, the number of babies born hit a new record low of 811,604, and women are now expected to have an average of 1.3 children in their lifetime, far below the rate needed to maintain a population."

20,Is sodium the future for the electric mobility transition?,trends," The warnings are everywhere, too much sodium is bad for your health as we have been told by adverts and even doctors suggest that patients move to low-sodium salts. However, it is sodium that might turn out to be an environmental saviour in the green energy transition. Until now, a vast majority of batteries that have been used in electric vehicles are of various lithium-ion chemistries. While lithium-based batteries take advantage of the light elemental weight of lithium, there are significant issues around thermal stability, and, more importantly, going forward major issues around resources, since lithium is not used alone in batteries but in conjunction with other metals and minerals that have their own resource problems. The most popular battery chemistry used by the global automotive industry currently is known as Lithium-Nickel, Manganese and Cobalt (Li-NMC). The dramatic growth of demand for electric vehicles across the world has led to a shortage of lithium, and prices per ton touching $60,000 and more on the spot markets recently, quadrupling in under a year. Persistent concerns about the ethical sourcing of cobalt, primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo also are not going away. The recent war in Ukraine has led to prices of Nickel shooting skywards increasing 10 times in the space of a few days which even led to the London Metals Exchange stopping the trade in the metal, has led to a situation where prices for battery packs for electric vehicles which after years of decline have increased between 10-20 in the past few months. Lithium-NMC batteries which cost $1,200 per kWh of capacity in 2010 had fallen to $132/kWh in 2021 (and on a per-cell basis for unfinished batteries, prices were $100/kWh) and have seen prices nearing $200/kWh in global markets in 2022, but a shortage of lithium coupled with a global semiconductor shortage has meant that there will be a shortage of batteries by 2024-2025, followed by a lack of raw materials by 2027–2028. This is despite a gradual shift towards Lithium-Ferro-Phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries that albeit heavier than Li-NMC batteries as well as suffering from ‘battery memory’ issues are less resource-hungry than Li-NMC, with iron and phosphate being significantly cheaper and more environmentally friend to extract and refine than the metals in Li-NMC. Advances in electric vehicle battery management software (BMS), much of it written in Indian technology hubs such as Hyderabad and Bengaluru, have alleviated earlier problems with LFP cells. This is why India’s largest carmaker Maruti-Suzuki, in conjunction with Toyota Motor Corporation, Denso, Panasonic, and Toshiba is establishing a facility in Gujarat that will finish manufacturing battery packs using LFP cells although the cells will for now be imported from BYD in China. Chinese Domination This statement also hides an important fact to consider in the electric mobility transition, China’s domineering control over much of the resources required for the electric vehicle transition. The Communist Party leadership in China has made the transition to electric vehicles an important lever of state policy, deploying billions of dollars to developing charging infrastructure across the country, subsidising manufacturing by Chinese manufacturers from electric two-wheelers to large commercial vehicles, and ensuring that acquiring the resources required for electric vehicles across the world is an important foreign policy aim. While China has among the world’s largest proven reserves of Lithium, Chinese companies control mines in Australia and increasing in South America as well. China also controls much of the mined cobalt today in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has a domineering control of rare-earth metals that are required for electronic components. As a result, China dominates Lithium-cell manufacturing with companies like CATL, BYD, and Gangfeng Lithium accounting for over three-quarters of global cell production, although finished battery packs are often manufactured elsewhere. China also dominates the manufacturing of charging systems. China’s attitude towards electric mobility is best displayed through its treatment of Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors. There was a realisation at higher levels of the Chinese state apparatus that getting the latest technologies in electric vehicle manufacturing and software will require certain concessions to be made. Therefore, unlike many other automobile manufacturers who were required to form joint ventures with Chinese partners, Tesla was given special permission to set up a fully owned subsidiary in China. Tesla’s ‘Gigafactory’ in China produced 484,130 vehicles, half of the carmaker’s annual production. Tesla also has a strong position in the Chinese market, and has played a major role in popularising electric cars in China. However, now China’s own carmakers such as Shanghai Automobile Industrial Corporation (SAIC) which sells cars under the MG brand in India and BYD are becoming large global players in their own right and both companies are operating in India as well. BYD has a fully-integrated manufacturing chain making everything from the Lithium-Ion cell to the finished cars, trucks, and buses. While the Joe Biden administration is taking measures to start mining for lithium and other important metals and minerals in the American southwest, progress has been slow due to environmental concerns. India has been very slow to either prospect for Lithium and other materials, especially from the perspective of national interest, let alone the urge to move to zero tailpipe emissions, policy matters have not incentivised the demand-side adequately, especially in passenger cars, which for better or for worse remain the gold standard in transportation. A ham-handed pursuit of Musk and Tesla to set up shop in India is evidence of this. That said, the FAME-1 and FAME-2 incentives have played their part, and there are increasing numbers of electric vehicles in India, especially in public transit and two-wheelers. State governments such as those in Delhi and Maharashtra have also given generous incentive packages, however, with subsidies capped at a certain level, they make little or no difference to sales of larger vehicles but have helped promote electric two-wheelers although some suspect that the recent spate of thermal runaway incidents was because several ‘new’ players in the two-wheeler space were nothing more than traders assembling sub-standard products. Therein lies an important issue. While India will manufacture electric vehicles, it might take some time before manufacturing of the cells takes place in India. While Australia opens up their mineral resources for exploitation by Indian companies, especially in the Lithium-rich areas in Western Australia, India will be highly dependent on China for critical elements of the electric supply chain going forward. This will be no different than India’s reliance on countries in the Arabian peninsula for oil and natural gas, but unlike deep civilisational ties between India and Arab nations, India and China are not friends. Despite a strong trade relationship, events in eastern Ladakh where a deadly border clash occurred in 2020 as well as India’s increasing pivot to the West, through partnerships such as the ‘Quad’ between Australia, Japan, India and the US have made the relationship tougher. Is There A Solution For India? There might be an interesting way out and that is the continued development of Sodium-Ion battery technology. While we are still in the early stages of Sodium-Ion (Na-Ion) battery chemistry development, it is important to note that progress has been substantial in this area over the past few years. On the last day of 2021, Reliance New Energy Solar announced a GBP 100-million buyout of British sodium-ion technology firm Faradion along with an investment of GBP 25-million for further development and commercial rollout with a particular focus on India’s fast-growing electric vehicle segment. That said, it is the CATL that is supercharging the development of Lithium-Ion technologies and has already commercially deployed the first generation of such batteries, and is in the process of not just developing an industrial supply-chain for Na-ion cells by 2023 but also coming out with the second-generation of Na-ion technology within a few months if patent filings are to be believed. It is not as if sodium-ion cells do not have disadvantages, by simple elemental weight, sodium is heavier than lithium, which makes Na-ion cells heavier. There is also the fact that Na-ion cells are less energy-dense than li-ion cells. The latest generation of Li-NMC cells can store 250Wh/kg as well as run at higher voltages that allow you faster charging and discharging (for performance). Even LFP cells can now store up to 220Wh/kg whereas the first generation of Na-Ion cells is at just 160Wh/kg currently, and run at lower voltages. That said, the single-biggest advantage of Sodium batteries will be the easy availability of the resources required on such cells. Sodium is not just a key component of readily available salt which can be extracted easily, Soda Ash or washing soda as it is commonly called is easily mined on sedimentary rocks and available almost globally. Another key part of the Na-Ion, as described by CATL and other researchers, is something called Prussian White which is derived from a common ferrocyanide pigment called ‘Prussian Blue’. Also, Sodium is much less corrosive than the types of Lithium used on cells currently which will allow the usage of cheaper materials like aluminium instead of copper both in the electrolyte as well as the battery frame. The usage of these cheaper and lighter materials will offset some of the weight disadvantages of Sodium over Lithium. In addition by not using Cobalt, issues around ‘ethical mining’ are also taken care of. Indeed, Soda Ash extraction and refining is nowhere near as environmentally concerning even as Lithium. Nickel prices have also skyrocketed thanks to the recent war, and Na-Ion cells do not need significant amounts of this metal, although Nickel will continue to play a major role in the automotive industry because of its use in the high-strength steel frames of cars and motorcycles. To top it all, Sodium cells are far more thermally stable than Li-Ion cells where widespread instances of thermal runaway have occurred even in India. The pace of development is stunning and the costs of Li-Ion battery packs have fallen dramatically in the past 12 years. There is significant research being conducted on Na-Ion cells across the world both at an electro-chemical level and also on the battery management software side of things that can manage the cells. Those in the automotive industry suspect that Sodium cells can easily replace Lithium-Ion cells in applications where speed through rapid power discharging is not critical, for example, heavy commercial vehicles both for passengers and freight, all sorts of low-speed vehicles such as local delivery two and three-wheelers and even small hatchbacks. The lower costs of Sodium-Ion could potentially mean electric cars made available in India at prices around Rs 6-8 lakh if one uses a 2022 price benchmark. That said, one should not get very excited. It took scientists decades to tame Lithium and use it as an energy storage medium and thermal runaway incidents still occur. We are not aware of the potential pitfalls of Sodium cells just yet, with issues like disposal and as well as how they age not yet being thought of. How many cycles can they be charged before degrading? Can they be fast-charged and what are the other electrochemical properties? Li-NMC and LFP cells are guaranteed for over eight years and as the earliest electric cars from the current generation hit the eight-year mark as well as high cycles of charging and discharging, the learnings have been interesting, to say the least from these real-life examples. Batteries have retained their state of charge better than predicted in some cases and others have had to be destroyed due to climatic conditions. The industry, that is both automotive and cell manufacturers are still learning, but it is imperative to not put all her eggs in the lithium basket especially since she has no lithium resources. Investments have to be made by the government and India’s private sector to fund the research and development of such alternate electrochemical technologies to protect India’s core energy interests going forward in the coming decades if India is to achieve her goal of net-zero emissions by 2070 as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Glasgow.

21,Apple's iPhone 14 series to have four variants this year: Report,trends," A market research report from industry analysis firm Omdia says Apple is going to produce four variants for the iPhone 14 - iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max - instead of three, like with the iPhone 13. The report says that Apple's primary source of OLED displays will remain the same, and Samsung, LG and BOE will provide the company with displays across all variants of the upcoming smartphone. As per the report (via Chinese publication IT Home), Samsung will remain the primary supplier for the Cupertino technology giant, with the Korean company set to supply displays for iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. LG will provide displays for iPhone 13, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max. BOE, meanwhile, will only supply displays for iPhone 13 and iPhone 14. Apple is likely to skip the mini variant this year, and has instead replaced it with a Plus variant for the iPhone 14. The variants will use LTPS OLED and LTPO OLED displays. The report says that iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will have 6.1-inch and 6.9-inch displays, and will use the LTPS OLED panels. The panels are likely to have higher refresh rates as well, but variable refresh rates will be exclusive to the Pro and Pro Max models. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will offer the same screen sizes as the other two variants, but will use LTPO OLED panels, with support for high, variable, refresh rates. The report also says that there might be an ""always-on"" mode with the Pro and Pro Max, since devices with LTPO OLED panels have that option."

1,Former Google contractor claims company infiltrated by religious cult,trends," Kevin Lloyd, an ex-Google contractor, who worked as a video producer for Google Developer Studio (GDS), has claimed that at least 12 members belong to a religious cult and exercise a great deal of influence over the studio. A report in The New York Times said Lloyd filed a lawsuit against Google and his contracting agency AGS, saying he was wrongfully terminated, which caused him emotional distress, and that the company acted out in retaliation against his claims, while the contracting agency failed to protect him against discrimination. Lloyd identified  the ""cult"" as the Fellowship of Friends. According to NYT, it believes a ""higher consciousness can be achieved by embracing fine arts and culture”. The cult owns a 1200-acre compound in Oregon, California in the US. GDS's main lead Peter Lubbers has been a longtime member and is apparently responsible for roping other members, including video producer Gabe Pannell. The report also says that the cult members hold important roles at company events and Google allegedly buys wine served at these events from a winery run by a member of the cult. In the lawsuit, Lloyd also claims that Google paid for a state-of-the-art sound system for the cult's property in Oregon."
2,"UP teen, who once begged on streets, passes class 10 exam with first division, wants to be an ‘agniveer’",trends," A teenager in Uttar Pradesh, who once begged on the streets, has passed his class 10 board exams with first division and now aspires to join the Army, according to a Times of India report. Sher Ali, who lives in a slum in Agra’s Sadar area, scored 63 percent marks in UP board exams. His best score -- 80 out of 100 -- was in English. He is the first among his neighbours to pass class 10 exams. Ali told the Times of India that he wanted to join the Indian Army through the Agnipath scheme -- which is for short-term recruitment to the armed forces. The scheme proposes to recruit jawans for a short four-year tenure without pension benefits. It has sparked widespread protests across the country. But to Ali, who has been brought up in extreme poverty, the scheme seems like a window to a better life. “My results have given me confidence to aim higher,” he told the Times of India. “I am now aiming to join the Army through the Agnipath scheme and serve India,” he said. Ali said it was child rights activist Naresh Paras who got him enrolled in a school. Sharing the happy news on Facebook, the activist wrote: “He set an example for the world. My hard work paid off. We both won.” Speaking to the Times of India later, he said Ali was not just good with academics but extra-curricular activities too."

5,Bizarre blue light spiral spooks stargazers in New Zealand,trends," Sky watchers in New Zealand caught sight of something bizarre yet fascinating on June 19 -- a spiral of blue light which seemed like a giant galaxy. Quickly, they took pictures and shared them on online astronomy groups.   Among those who witnessed the spectacle was Alasdair Burns, a stargazing guide. He told the Guardian a friend texted him on Sunday night to step out of his house and watch the sky. What he saw next was astounding. ""It looked like an enormous spiral galaxy, just hanging there in the sky, and slowly just drifting across,” he added. ""Quite an eerie feeling.” He alerted his neighbours to the sighting too. “We quickly banged on the doors of all our neighbours to get them out as well,"" the told the Guardian. ""And so there were about five of us, all out on our shared veranda looking up and just kind of, well, freaking out just a little bit.” Another resident said that to her, it looked like a planet or star. She added: “It wasn’t blinking or twinkling, and it was moving fairly fast... so fascinating,” she said. Witnesses came up with theories about what could have caused the spiral to appear. Was it aliens at work? A UFO? A black hole? The explanation was much simpler. Professor Richard Easther from the University of Auckland pointed to a SpaceX satellite launch off Florida's Cape Canaveral on Sunday. He said that when a rocket takes a satellite into orbit, strange-looking clouds can become visible. “When the propellant is ejected out the back, you have what’s essentially water and carbon dioxide – that briefly forms a cloud in space that’s illuminated by the sun,” he was quoted as saying by the Guardian."
6,Fluctuating credit score got you confused? OneScore's Find Out Why feature has all the answers,trends," If you're in the market for a loan, a strong credit score can be a huge asset. The first step in building a strong credit score is to understand how it is calculated. However, this can be challenging - there are 4 different credit bureaus in India, and each has their own formula. This is why your credit score is slightly different according to each bureau. While you can educate yourself on the parameters that go into the calculation (your payment history, credit utilization, age of credit, consistency of personal information), you can't really say for sure why your credit score moves up or down each month. The trouble is, if you don't understand what you're doing right, how do you do more of the right things? This is particularly important when you're trying to recover from tough financial circumstances. If you don't have strong credit scores, you can't avail credit; and often, that is when you need credit most. Can the internet help? Of course it can! But only as far as education goes. You'll find generic information, tips, best practices, etc. What you won't find is information specific to your case. Credit bureau reports tell you what your score is, and the details about your credit history, but make no recommendations or predictions. The OneScore App however, does both. The Find Out Why feature in the app tells you exactly why your score moved up or down, helping you mold smarter financial habits that allow you to consistently work towards a better financial future. Using the app is easy - once you've signed up, the app shows you your credit score according to Experian and Cibil each month. You can click on the 'Find Out Why' button for personalized insights on why your credit score is changing each month. Is it easy to understand? The OneScore App aims at making it easy for everyone to maintain a strong credit score. The reasons listed in the Find Out Why feature are in simple, easy to understand terms: no jargon. For instance, if you've used your credit card extensively the previous month (even if you paid on time), your credit utilization increases, bringing your credit score down. The feature explains this. Similarly, small increases in the credit score occur when you consistently pay all your bills and EMIs on time. The Find Out Why feature lets you see how you're progressing each month. The OneScore App makes it easy to monitor and build your credit score, month on month. By checking your credit score, using the Find Out Why feature, and keeping up with the AI recommendations on actions you can take, building a strong credit score (even after financial mishaps) is now within everyone's reach.

Every immigrant who has come to this country, they all have their own unique stories. Fighting for a better life, hardships but they also end up having a belief in America."" He then added that he and his sibling could ""not have had a better role model."" Bezos has always been quite public in his admiration of his stepfather. In 2018, he made an appreciation post for him on Twitter in which he wrote, ""My dad came here from Cuba all by himself without speaking English when he was 16 years old, and has been kicking ass ever since. Thank you for all the love and heart, Dad!"" My dad came here from Cuba all by himself without speaking English when he was 16 years old, and has been kicking ass ever since.

10,Navy officer-turned-CEO's advice on how to succeed in business,trends," United States Navy Officer Thomas Douglas made a big investment in 2001. He bought the IT solutions company that he had joined as an entry-level engineer. Now, over two decades later, as the CEO of JMARK, he has established himself as a noteworthy leader. On LinkedIn, has been endorsed as someone with a rare combination of “business management acumen and positive, high- performance attitude”. Since he took charge, the Missouri-based company has found itself counted among top private companies in the US multiple times. JMARK says that it adheres to a “People First, Technology Second” philosophy. This is something its CEO emphasised in an interview with the Military Times website. When asked for advice on how to succeed in business, the first point he put forth was team work and building relationships Some sacrifices are also necessary along the way, he added. “I often had to pay talented people more than myself to ensure we had the right people around us,” he told the website. “If you invest and believe in people, it will pay off."" Forgiveness is important, he added. “Grace is key in learning as a team and making sure you ultimately win”. Douglas said people will always be essential to business, but more automation will make success easier. “Automate as much as possible,” he was quoted as saying by Military Times. “From accounting, processes, communications, etc. There are more tools available now than ever before. Do the research to figure out how to minimize the humans that you need to accomplish the outcomes to control costs and volatility.” Douglas advised entrepreneurs to keep cash reserves in case of contingencies. “Winter is always coming,” he said. “I ran for years without much cash and was fortunate that we didn’t have really bad times. It would have destroyed us.” And last, the learning must never stop."

Sri Lanka has been witnessing protests and riots since March. As outrage against the government's handling of the crisis intensified, Mahinda Rajapaksa stepped down as prime minister in May. The situation in the island nation is so dire that four out of five people have begun skipping meals , the United Nations said, AFP reported. The World Food Programme, UN's food assistance branch, is attempting to raise $60 million to fund a food relief effort for Sri Lanka between June and December. Earlier this week, it started handing out food vouchers to pregnant women in the capital Colombo."
13,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,trends," Indian banks may tie up with Russian lenders not affected by sanctions Indian banks such as Canara Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, and UCO Bank may join hands with Russian banks that are not under Western sanctions to facilitate bilateral payments. These banks will likely open accounts at their Russian counterparts and vice versa, as decided last week in meetings held in New Delhi. Why it’s important: Bilateral trade between India and Russia has been impacted due to the Ukraine war. The partnership between banks will ensure smooth trade flows without violating the economic sanctions imposed by Western nations.  Apollo in talks to buy real estate loan book of L&T Finance Apollo Global Management is in advanced talks with L&T Finance Holdings to acquire realty loans worth Rs 8,000-9,000 crore. The deal, pegged at $1 billion, will also help L&T get cash upfront instead of through staggered payments, allowing it to deleverage its balance sheet, while the private equity group will get a portfolio of real estate assets with some first-loss protection. Why it’s important: L&T Finance is looking to focus on the retail segment by pruning its infrastructure and real estate exposure. This deal will help it to accomplish that.  Regulator considers linking insurance fraud with credit score The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India is considering a proposal to make insurance frauds a parameter for calculating credit scores to restrain an increase in such illegal activity. The proposal is being considered by the insurance regulator because such frauds have been estimated to cost over Rs 450 billion every year. Why it’s important: If the proposal is approved, insurance frauds would feature when the risk profiles of individuals are evaluated, which would reflect on their credit scores. A poor credit score can prevent an individual from availing financial services such as loans and credit cards.  Finance ministry to relaunch Banks Board Bureau with expanded mandate The finance ministry will expand and relaunch the Banks Board Bureau by bringing in more representatives from the insurance sector.

Why it’s important: The revamp will enable the bureau to recommend top executives at financial institutions. It would also address judicial orders that have held the bureau was not the competent authority to recommend appointments at state-run general insurers.  India’s bad bank rushes to complete first transaction to avoid missing deadline India’s bad bank is racing against time to complete its first transaction by 30 June, failing which it will have to seek an extension from the Reserve Bank of India. The National Asset Reconstruction Company, the government-backed asset turnaround company, had earlier set itself a deadline of 31 March to acquire Rs 500 billion worth of bad assets, but failed to meet it due to procedural reasons. Why it’s important: The central bank’s licensing norms say NARCL must start operations and complete a transaction by 30 June. It is, however, still valuing assets proposed to be sold by lenders. It is unlikely that the agency will be able to meet the deadline.  LIC valuation will reflect its inherent strength once market stabilises The stock price of state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India has eroded as much as 25 percent since its initial public offer. Chairperson M R Kumar said once the market stabilises, its inherent strength and performance will be recognized. Why it’s important: Investors looking to book quick profits from the initial share sale has been disappointed. LIC shares are now likely to fetch reasonable returns only in the medium to long term.  Employee payments in virtual digital assets to attract 30 percent tax Employers will have to pay 30 percent tax on virtual digital assets such as cryptocurrencies they offer to employees as compensation or otherwise. The tax will be levied on the difference between the cost of asset acquisition and transfer price to the employee. In the case of employees, the transfer price would be considered the cost of acquisition. Why it’s important: The value of cryptocurrencies have crashed in recent weeks. Companies looking to pay employees in virtual digital assets are unlikely to find many takers, more so it they are taxed at a high rate.  Reliance Industries likely to make important announcement in AGM The 45th annual general meeting of Reliance Industries may be held in the next few weeks. Some experts said it may revive plans of an oil-to-chemicals demerger, which was shelved last year. The company may also spell out its future plans for its retail and telecom businesses that operate as separate units. It could also make further announcements in the green energy sector. Why it’s important: Reliance derives almost 60 percent of its revenue and nearly 50 percent of pre-tax earnings from its refining, petrochemicals, and fuel retail business. Retail and telecom account for 34 percent of revenue and nearly 45 percent of pre-tax profits. The ratio might change as the conglomerate focusses more on its consumer businesses.  Telecom operators call for tougher norms for private captive networks The Cellular Operators Association of India, which counts Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio as members, has demanded tough conditions for allowing enterprises to set up captive non-public networks. The demand comes a few days after the cabinet, despite opposition from telcos, permitted enterprises to set up private networks, with the department of telecom assigning them spectrum directly. Why it’s important: The telcos are strongly opposed to private networks, which they fear might erode the viability of their businesses. The tech companies, who stand to benefit, are strongly in favor. It’s not clear how this will play out, given the high floor prices for G spectrum.  India’s win on fishing subsidies at WTO is start of a long fight India’s successful defense of the rights of developing countries to subsidize fisheries at the World Trade Organization’s ministerial conference is just the start of a long battle. The small print suggests the matter will require further negotiations. Members will need to announce comprehensive guidelines within four years, or the current agreement will be terminated."
14,Tamil Nadu man collected Rs 6 lakh in Rs 10 coins to buy a car. Here's why,trends," A man from Tamil Nadu spent a month collecting Rs 6 lakh in Rs 10 coins to buy a car. Surprised? So were the employees of the car dealership where he turned up. Vetrivel, a resident of Arur, said that his mother, who runs a shop, had come across several instances when customers refused to accept Rs 10 coins. As a result, Vetrivel ended up with a large heap of those coins at home. Sharing another incident, the man added that he also saw children in the area playing with Rs 10 coins as if they were worthless. That's why he decided to create awareness by buying a car with only Rs 10 coins. “My mother runs a shop and since people don't want to accept the Rs 10 coins, they have been piling up at home. No one is ready to accept the coins. Even in banks, officials are reluctant to use them. They claim they don't have the numbers to count the coins,"" Vetrivel told India Today. ""When RBI has not said that the coins are worthless, why aren’t banks accepting them? Even if we complain, no action is taken."" To spread awareness about this problem, Vetrivel spent nearly a month collecting Rs 10 coins worth Rs 6 lakh to buy the car. Initially, the car dealership in Dharmapuri was hesitant to go ahead with the transaction, but considering Vetrivel’s determination, they agreed to go ahead with the deal."
15,"More booze than food on the menu, roomy yet intimate - Tesouro Goa is India's best bar for a reason",trends," I’m not sure when I’ll be in Goa next, but I’m pretty certain that a visit to Bar Tesouro will on the agenda along with leisurely two-wheeler rides past sun-splashed churches and mackerel recheado and rice. You might like a particular bar for reasons entirely different from mine, but Tesouro has its fundamentals in place. Its menu has way more booze—lots of it, of all kinds—than food; it manages to be both roomy and intimate; and it’s got comfortable chairs and high stools. The Goan-Portuguese flooring, the al fresco area, and gracefully ageing turquoise blue bar counter, inherited from the previous owner of the property, impart a neighbourhood-bar feel to Tesouro and root it firmly in its cultural context. The bartenders are both domain experts and attentive listeners, eager to talk about flavours and new launches, and generous with complimentary pours of spirits one is curious about. Tesouro has several intriguing cocktails, but the breakaway hit is the Midnight Brekkie, a perfectly calibrated concoction featuring  peanut butter-washed gin, strawberry puree, watermelon juice, vermouth, and malic acid. Loyal customers are known to pre-order the drink and purchase bottles to take back home. Midnight Brekkie “They have nailed it in terms of ambience, consistency, and classic and experimental cocktails. It’s become, like, the Basilica of Bom Jesus for enthusiasts,” says Kimberly Pereira, who was part of the 30 Best Bars India jury and is brand ambassador for the agave spirit Pistola, which is produced in Goa. In April this year, the bar, located in Colva, in south Goa, was ranked India’s Best Bar for 2021 by 30 Best Bars India, a bar ranking and awards platform, and towards the end of that month, it slotted in at number 4 in Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2022 ranking. Tesouro is the only bar in the top 10 not based in a major Asian city. Veteran bartenders Arijit Bose and Pankaj Balachandran opened Tesouro in late 2021 along with Donovan Vaz, restaurateur and scion of a south Goa-based liquor distribution family. There were several things the trio was adamant about when conceptualising Tesouro, says Bose. “We wanted to create an environment dedicated to the appreciation of cocktails and fine spirits. We would make great food, but not a hundred different kinds; because the moment that happens, it would become a dinner place that would have drawn in families and kids, which needs a very different set-up. And no live music either,” says Bose. Bar Tesouro Goa Tesouro was supposed to be a bar where people, in south Goa, could come in — “even for one drink” — three to four times a week instead of driving all the way to North Goa. “We wanted to be a part of the community here, a neighbourhood bar where you would find the same service, same hospitality, and same environment regardless of when you visit it,” says Bose who particularly remembers a piece of advice he received when he was picking friends’ and peers’ brains before the bar’s launch. “My friend Daniele Dalla Pola (mixologist and entrepreneur) said that if a lady were to come alone to the bar, she should have a good time. And that means everything from the time they get out of the car to how the whole floor staff and bartenders interact with them is important in ensuring that women feel both comfortable and safe here .” Bose also feels that India has never been as conducive to the evolution of the cocktail bar scene as it is now. “Over the last seven years, we have built a much more robust ecosystem that ensures you have the right ingredients for a great cocktail bar experience. For example, we have a company that helped us build an ergonomic bar; architects that can think more about operations and less about how beautiful something would look. Like, a 7-foot high shelf with bottles and all might look cool, but the average Indian cannot reach it,” says Bose."

17,Ayahs in England: The journey from obscurity to a blue plaque,trends," On Thursday a blue plaque was mounted on a nondescript building in Hackney. 26 King Edwards Road, was the address – Ayahs’ Home – where abandoned ayahs primarily from India (and also China and Ceylon) were provided accommodation. For long consigned just about to the footnotes of history, the blue plaque, which commemorates the significance of a building because of its linkage with personalities or events, has now given an impetus to explore and investigate in greater detail the lives of the ayahs. The journey for the blue plaque began with Farhanah Mamoojee, a resident of Hackney, watching a BBC show in 2018 where an elderly man spoke about how common it was for families sailing from India to England to have an ayah with them. As a child, he himself sailed under the care of an ayah. Neither did the elderly man remember the name of the ayah, nor did the Ayahs’ Home, which was also referred to in the show, show any trace of its extraordinary connection with a marginalised slice of British colonialism. Mamoojee wanted to set this straight and thus began the quest for a blue plaque. The local Hackney Museum and few other academics interested or already working on the subject came together. One constant source of inspiration was the pioneering book by historian Rozina Visram. Ayahs, Lascars and Princes: Indians in Britain 1700-1947, published in 1986, provided the foundational work that brought into focus the presence of South Asians in Britain and did much to dispel the notion that it was only from the 1950s that they had settled down in England. Within the hierarchy of Asians – maharajahs, nawabs, civil servants, lawyers, students, servants – who lived or spent time in Britain, the ayahs were on the wrong side both due to their gender and what scholar Satyasikha Chakraborty calls the class collusion of British and Indian employers. No doubt, the majority of the ayahs were brought by English families sailing to England on holiday or after retirement, but there were also rich Indian families who made use of their services for the daunting ship voyage. When Visram began her research there were hardly any electronic resources or newspaper archives on websites. But there were enough references to pique her interest in the figure of the ayah. “Warren Hastings came to England with two servants who were returned as they were not working as hard as they were in India. There was the famous Joshua Reynolds painting, and also Julia Mills in Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield who returns from India [with a black man and a copper-coloured woman in linen],” remembered Visram as she spoke at the Hackney Museum to an excited audience. However advertisements in the 18th and 19th century newspapers about services by ayahs which she located on microfilms made her wonder what happened to them. Upon reaching England, many would be abandoned as the families would have no use for them, while some would live with them for varying duration. Advancements in shipping and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 reduced the journey time considerably. The increased traffic and growing bureaucracy meant there would be young families in England too needing an ayah for the journey to resume duties in the sub-continent. Some lucky enough to get such families would leave for the familiar climes of India, but the less fortunate ones had to deal with bureaucratic indifference and lead lives fashioned by the exaggerated sense of benevolence and piety that the benefactors expected. By the early 20th century, the Ayahs’ Home in Hackney was run by the Christian missionaries in London and became the most well-known and one-of-its-kind institute for the abandoned ayahs. It provided sanctuary and space to them, but the ayahs were also subject to persistent efforts to embrace Christianity. Details about their everyday lives and struggle are difficult to find as they do not seem to have left any accounts. But researchers and scholars are slowly covering the ground to get a wider picture. Dr Jo Stanley at the University of Hull has put a figure of close to 1,000 ayahs coming to the UK between 1890 and 1960, with traceable records showing 308 who left. Dr Florian Stadtler shared the passport copy of ‘Anthony Ayah’ which points out that she perhaps managed to leave England. The ayahs took over the surnames of the families for whom they worked thus diluting their own identities and also making it difficult for researchers to trace them. Several of them made multiple journeys over several years as the pay offered was much better. They could also accompany the families to Europe if the need be and in the process pick up elementary French or German, thus increasing their chances of employment. In the wake of the 1857 uprising, ayahs in India came in for much praise for saving lives of English women and children on personal risks. Although writers like Rudyard Kipling and M.M. Kaye romanticised the ayahs to some extent as they raised English boys as Indians to save them, questions of morality too hovered around them. Interestingly, the ayahs have also been portrayed in some English works as a figure which gets empowered due to the foreign voyage to fight patriarchy in Indian society! Scattered around in various untapped archives, and due to their own precarious position, the ayahs in contemporary sources are still largely silent and appear subjugated. Apart from local council (municipal) archives and the London City Mission Magazine where the Ayahs’ Home and ayahs themselves appear, they were also captured in paintings giving a glimpse of their tender care and affection. Now that episodes of drunken parties, and some ayahs petitioning courts are filtering it is high time they come out of the façade of Victorian values. “It is a wrong notion to say that all these Indian women were docile,” reminds Visram. “These women were presented very differently. They are made to look smaller than they were. They could be related to me or to anybody. We should not pigeonhole them in Asian or British history, they are part of a global history,” said Mamoojee."
18,"Boman Irani on making his web series debute: ""Acting is acting. There is a camera, there are lights...""",trends," Boman Irani and Samara Tijori play father and daughter in Masoom, a thriller series on Disney+ Hotstar that has been adapted from the Irish show Blood. In a video interview, the actors shared details of their latest work, which unfolds in Punjab when the Kapoors lose a central family member. Would you describe 'Masoom' as a whodunit, a psychological thriller or a father-daughter relationship drama? Samara: It is all of the above. The show is full of thrills, drama, and relationships. Each sibling has a different relationship with the other. The dynamics are so varied in just this one family, which should be very interesting to watch. Boman: It is an intriguing thriller about people, but then the characters and their relationships, and whether they resolve them those questions take over. It’s a route to understanding human relationships and the human condition. Also read: Masoom review: The menacing shadows of family dysfunction Have you seen the original series 'Blood'? Boman: We made a conscious effort not to see the original. We had a script that had been adapted and Indianised. Eventually the breathing of a character and making him a real human being is up to you, in the moment and in the world those characters are living in. If you have seen the earlier performance, it can influence you – conditioning my mind to do something that might not be truthful to what my gut tells me. So we decided not to see it and that made me more comfortable and I felt what I was doing for my character, and what Samara was doing for her character, was truthful for the world we are creating. The story is about how the plot affects Samara’s character and me, wherever we might be – England, Ireland or India. Samara: I didn’t watch it either. In fact I didn’t know it was a remake till I did a reading with Mihir (Desai, director). I decided not to watch Blood because I think it can influence you to try to do the same thing. Boman, a thriller is a less explored genre for you. Was that one of the attractions to this role? No. It’s never the genre but always the writing and the exploration of what is being said. Can I relate to it, because if I don’t relate to it at a personal level then I can’t expect the audience to relate to it either. The last thing on my mind is how I can showcase my acting skills. The question is will the part give me a good chance to act? What is the piece speaking about? Masoom has intrigue and speaks of a father-daughter relationship. How do you deal with your daughter after the death of your spouse? How do you identify with dissent and how do you deal with a daughter who is feisty? The genre is just a way to tell this story. If the piece has universal themes, then you feel you are not just talking about a twist in the tale but a little more than that. That is what attracted me to Masoom. Samara, you were last seen in Bob Biswas but this is your first major role. What was the biggest learning for you? The writing did a lot for me. There was so much on paper and in the scenes for me to execute. I was very invested even when I was reading the script the first time. I was glued. That is important. My gut was to say yes. Mihir was a blessing. I did readings with him for a very long time. We made notes scene by scene: what is her mood, the emotion. Also for the world of the show, which is a small town in Punjab, I read a lot of Punjabi poetry and listened to Punjabi music while we are on location, just to get familiar and comfortable playing Sana and being in that zone. I would not have gotten that many layers in if it wasn’t for Mihir’s help.  Boman, what was it like working on your first web series and was it in any way different to working on a feature film? I don’t see any difference. I just enjoyed being on a set. Acting is acting. There is a camera, there are lights and assistants are screaming in your ears. Sometimes the economy of working as a character actor in a film is challenging. It can be a bit of a bummer because you could have done that little bit more to layer the character a bit more because sometimes we have just six to seven scenes in a film within which to capture all the motivations, arc, and everything. This series allowed me to do a nice character arc and that has to do with direction and writing, and what I bring within the truth of the piece. How much does the shooting location help get you into the mood of that world? Samara: It is most helpful to be in that atmosphere. We were shooting in a lot of local areas. The commute was also long. It would take one to one-and-a-half hours to travel from the hotel to the location. During those journeys, I would look out the window and see what life is like. That made me more comfortable and more familiar, which was helpful for playing the character. Even the set was beautiful. Boman: In theatre we are taught about the importance of a detailed imagination. So when you are staring at an audience, which is the fourth wall, what does that wall comprise of and where are you in relation to it? Everything has to be imagined and it takes a lot of hard work to be in the moment, in the momentum of what is going on. Shooting in Punjab, for example, the travel, weather, the smells, help put you in the moment so that leaves you to concentrate on the other part of the imagination – the emotional part."

20,US lawmakers want Google to tackle misleading abortion search results,trends," 14 US Senators and seven representatives have sent an open letter to Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, asking him why Google's search results failed to provide accurate information to women who sought out abortion services. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) conducted a study in which it found that Google search results for terms like ""abortion clinics near me"" and ""abortion pill"", often directed people to crisis pregnancy centres that are anti-abortion. The study went on to say that 1 in 10 search results on Google often leads users to anti-abortion ""fake clinics"". It also found that 28% of Google Ads displayed on these search results were for the ""fake clinics"". Other notable highlights from the report stated that 11% of results for ""abortion clinic near me"" and ""abortion pill"", led to fake results, and this included 37% of Google Maps searches. CCDH is of the opinion that these clinics claim impartial service, ""but in reality aim to dissuade individuals from having abortions."" They also have a record of, ""disseminating misinformation on the health risks of abortion."" CCDH used a Google Chrome extension called Location Guard, using which researchers performed searches related to abortion in 13 US states that have passed laws banning abortions. Then they analysed the first page of each result, which included paid search results, organic results, and Google Maps results, along with video and news results. They also took into account reviews posted by users which said that these ""fake clinics"" do not ""provide medical care"" and greatly ""exaggerated the risks of abortion."" This allowed researchers to determine their findings, after which they reported that these unverified Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPC), now outnumbered actual abortion clinics 3 to 1."

22,Meet Chintan Pandya: 'Unapologetic Indian' and the best chef in New York State,trends," Chintan Pandya doesn’t believe in pretensions – in life or at his restaurants. Speaking from New York where he’s based now, Pandya often resorts to Hindi phrases to make a point. That unrestrained simplicity reflects in the food at his New York-based restaurants – Rahi, Adda and Dhamaka, which he co-owns with business partner Roni Mazumdar. Begun bhaja, fried pomfret (a dish Pandya used to eat as bar food in Mumbai), gurda kaporra, macher jhol, ragda pattice and a Meghalayan boiled pig’s head salad arrive in clay pots, pressure cookers and other vessels that they are cooked in. The straightforwardness has resonated with diner and critics alike, and the result is recognition and a packed reservation book. Edited excerpts from an interview with Chintan Pandya, who won the title of Best Chef in New York State at the James Beard Foundation Awards announced earlier this week: Dhamaka got to No.1 on the New York Times New restaurants list and now the James Beard Foundation Award for best chef – New York. Did you anticipate this when you opened Dhamaka in 2021? Never. This is a dream run. When we launched Dhamaka in Essex Market on the Lower East Side, I told my business partner Roni Mazumdar that we will survive if Dhamaka manages to get even 10 percent of the accolades that Adda, our second restaurant, received. Adda was No.8 on New York Times Top 10 new restaurant of 2021. Then Dhamaka comes along and clinches the No.1 spot on the list in 2022. The New York Times list is the most prestigious for the world of restaurants and was always dominated by western and French restaurants. Adda was the first Indian restaurant followed by Dhamaka to feature on the list. When someone sent me the list, I was driving. I thought it was a joke. I can’t explain the feeling. And now the James Beard Award. So yes, it’s been a dream run. Perceptions around Indian food have been stuck. Do you think this award will help change that to some extent? I think it will empower chefs to take more risks. Indian food was never good on its own. It had to be fused with foreign ingredients such as truffle, wasabi or parmesan to make it gourmet. We were ashamed to make real Indian food. This recognition will empower a lot of chefs to believe that simple Indian food can be successful and it can bring you recognition and accolades. Your company is called Unapologetic Foods. Yes, and our servers wear T-shirts which say ‘Unapologetic Indian.’ When you go to a Japanese, French of Italian restaurant, you don’t ask the chef to modify the dish according to your taste. Will you go to a sushi restaurant and ask the chef to cook the fish for you? But Indian food is always modified to suit different palates. The first rule at all our restaurants is to never change our food to suit anyone. We serve Indian food that is the best version of the dish. Eat it or leave it – it’s your choice. A lot of people found us rude initially. They said we had to apologise for our spice levels. But I refused. That’s how the concept of ‘Unapologetic Indian’ came about. This is the food I have grown up eating. This is the food I love to eat. Why should I be ashamed of it or apologize for it? At the awards you thanked Roni Mazumdar for always believing in your ‘idiosyncrasies’ and stupidity. What is most stupid thing you have ever done? Oh the list is unbelievably long. Let me narrate a recent one. Someone wanted me to plan a special dinner 10 month in advance. He had a few things in mind with regards to chicken and goat. I went ahead and suggested that we actually buy a live goat and chickens and feed them things that the family loves to eat before we butcher them for the meal. That way, we will have the best meat to work with for the special meal. Sadly, the customer scurried away when I shared the cost of the project! But I have not given up on the idea. I am fine-tuning it, though I know it sounds crazy. (Photo credit Will Ellis) When you started Adda and Rahi what was the biggest misconception about Indian food in America? Americans believed that if you eat Indian food for lunch, you won’t be eating dinner, and if you ate it for dinner, you would probably have to skip lunch the next day. Too heavy and heartburn were the terms associated with our food. But I don’t blame the consumer for it. Indian food had an overdose of cream and butter. Our mothers never used cream in their cooking. But in restaurants, Indian chefs felt a need to do that. So it’s not a misconception but a reality. Dhamaka doesn’t use cream and butter in the dishes. We only cook in ghee. The concept of Dhamaka is ‘food just like it’s at home.’ Is that also your food philosophy? There was a time in my life when I was cooking to impress other people. I thought if I made simple food, people would think I am useless. But things changed the day, I realized that I should cook what I love to eat. It changed my entire product. My food philosophy is to keep things as simple and as nostalgic as possible. The food at Dhamaka transports people to some place in India while still being in America. That I think is the real success of Dhamaka. You are a Juhu boy. What are your earliest food memories? I am a Gujarati and grew up eating vegetarian food at home. Sunday meal was something we all looked forward to because that’s when mom made dal dhokli (a Gujarati dish of chapatti cooked in a lentil gravy). Gujaratis love ‘chatpata’ food. So bhelpuri, sevpuri, dosa and Chinese food from the roadside stall were a huge part of my life. Rasraj and Guru Kripa in Vile Parle and Shiv Sagar at Chowpatty were favourite haunts. We regularly hosted a lot of out-of-town guests at our home, and it used to be my responsibility to show them around Juhu. After the tour, I would invariably take them to Naturals ice-cream as it was my favourite. And since I was a kid, I never had to pay! Pressure cooker chicken, goat neck biryani, Champaran meat, doh khleh of Meghalaya, Rajasthani kharghosh (whole rabbit in yoghurt and cloves) - even restaurants in India don’t have these dishes. How did you zero in on the dishes for Dhamaka? Actually, we were struggling with the menu for Dhamaka when one day my wife casually made a lunch of aloo tindora (potato and apple gourd) subzi, dal and roti for me. She served it in the same kadhai she cooked in. When I had the first bite of that meal, I knew we had to recreate the same experience at Dhamaka – simple food served as it is at home. That’s what is missing in restaurants today. When I was working in India, I used to travel to different places and collect recipes from home cooks and chefs. I put them to use at Dhamaka. Dhamaka Champaran Meat (Photo credit: Paul McDonough) You have been a champion of head-to-toe cooking, using goat brains, kidneys, testicles and even pig’s face in your cooking. How do guests respond? They love it. The first ingredient we experimented with was goat’s brain. It became so popular that every Indian restaurant in New York was serving goat brain and the price of brain skyrocketed from $4.99 to $13.99 in a span of four months. That gave us the courage to go further. We actually have to ration the kidney and testicles (gurda kapura) that we serve or else a week’s portion will fly out in a night! We assume that people don’t want to eat these things but the truth is that they love it. Most of the dishes at Dhamaka are rustic in a way that they are cooked and served in the same clay pots, cast iron dishes and pressure cookers. How does that augur with the Instagram generation that loves to picture every meal? We only focus on our product and nothing else. We cook for people who love to eat. This is not a pretentious restaurant. The glasses at Dhamaka are from Ikea and the plates are stainless. Just like at home. We invest in top quality ingredients – our goat meat comes from Arizona, lamb from Denver, rabbit from a farm in Upstate New York and we serve the best paneer in America. In fact we tell people that if they find a better paneer elsewhere, they can bring it to us and we will reimburse the cost of the meal in cash! That’s how confident we are of our ingredients. People are too busy modernizing food and buying $50 plates to serve them in. We don’t do anything to impress people. What next? We are launching two concepts: a fried chicken concept called Rowdy Rooster and a kabab restaurant called Kababwala. Dhamaka interior. (Photo credit: Will Ellis) Favourite place to eat in Mumbai? Konkan Swad in Goregaon. I start with the bombil fry and sol kadi and then launch into the komdi wade, mutton, fish curry…basically everything on the menu. A meal you can eat anytime Dal khichdi with kadhi or chaas on a regular day. But if I want to indulge, then it’s olo (Gujrati baingan bharta), bajra roti, white makhan, jaggery and ghee. What’s the culinary trend you can’t stand? Fermentation. Ever since Noma started it, everyone in India wants to ferment everything. One item that's always in your fridge? Yogurt. I love chaas. We are coming home. What can we expect? Khichdi, if I had my way! But you could expect a chaat followed by a biryani and veg kababs. Favourite ingredient to work with? I love the character of methi - both the seed as well as fresh and dried methi. We have a dish called paneer methi at Dhamaka which is transformative. Favourite cookbook/recipe book? It’s mostly my handwritten notes that I keep going back to. One book I love is On food and cooking by Harold McGee. He’s a food scientist. They say ‘never trust a thin chef’. Can we trust you?"
