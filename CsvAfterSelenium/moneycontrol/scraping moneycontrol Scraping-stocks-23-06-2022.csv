2,Buy Gujarat Gas; target of Rs 650: Motilal Oswal,stocks," Motilal Oswal's research report on Gujarat Gas Spot LNG prices have risen to USD34/mmBtu from USD19/mmBtu in CY21, making alternate fuels such as LPG more attractive in Morbi, Gujarat. However, we highlight that over the long term, LNG would continue to remain cheaper than LPG, except during the summer season. Further, increased availability of domestic gas over the few months is likely to help GUJGA reduce its sourcing cost, thereby help improve its margins. GUJGA trades at 20x FY24 EPS of INR25.

3,Disney’s stakeholder capitalism vs Netflix’s shareholder capitalism,stocks," Wouldn’t it be nice if companies cared less about profits and more about the social good? It’s popular to think so. Stakeholder capitalism is fashionable. Shareholder capitalism is not. Many high-profile business leaders and academics now condemn the idea Milton Friedman laid out in a famous 1970 New York Times Magazine essay: ‘a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.’ If only this wicked notion of maximising profits hadn’t come along, some seem to think, we’d live in a progressive utopia of high wages, racial harmony, economic equality, and environmental purity. In 2019, the Business Roundtable repudiated the Friedman doctrine, changing its ‘Principles of Corporate Governance’ to embrace the goal of managing companies for the “benefit of all stakeholders — customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.” It didn’t specify how businesses would resolve conflicts between constituencies. The usual response is that conflicts are illusory. Do good and you’ll do well. “In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders,” wrote BlackRock’s Larry Fink in his 2022 letter to CEOs, reiterating the message that made news in 2018: “To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” Of course, if stakeholder-pleasing endeavours and the creation of economic value always went hand-in-hand, stakeholder and shareholder capitalism would be identical. But life isn’t that simple. Contrary to what you may have heard, letting stakeholders take precedence over business objectives is anything but nice. Stakeholder capitalism isn’t just a temptation for managers to pursue their pet interests. It’s a prescription for culture wars, political backlash, managerial paralysis, and human-resources nightmares. Every effective enterprise has to consider the interests of employees, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. But not everyone wants the same thing, and sometimes organisations have to make trade-offs between goals everyone might agree are good. The question is what to do when faced with a conflict. Without an eye on value maximisation, it’s too easy for managers to dissipate company resources by pursuing their personal interests. The great value of the Friedman doctrine is that it establishes a coherent standard for making trade-offs. Maximising economic value tells you to “spend an additional dollar on any constituency provided the long-term value added to the firm from such expenditure is a dollar or more,” as Harvard Business School economist Michael Jensen put it in a 2010 article. Stakeholder theory, by contrast, tells you nothing. It assumes you just make everybody happy. As Jensen wrote, “Without the clarity of mission provided by a single-valued objective function, companies embracing stakeholder theory will experience managerial confusion, conflict, inefficiency, and perhaps even competitive failure.” Jensen’s article is the best articulation of why what he calls “enlightened value maximization” is indispensable. But neither he nor Friedman fully imagined the chaos that could ensue without it. Look at the backlash when Walt Disney Co. tried to placate vocal employees by opposing Florida legislation to ban discussing sexual orientation with younger children in schools. The political pushback — like the original protests — reflected a sense of betrayal by a beloved company whose fans see their dreams and values reflected in its characters and stories. Appeasing one group of stakeholders alienated others. It wasn’t hard for conservatives to find opposing voices within the company. Disney has nearly 200,000 employees, and countless customers. All are stakeholders, and they represent every conceivable viewpoint. By focusing on business goals, by contrast, Netflix, despite other challenges, has more successfully weathered its own controversies, from conservative uproar over the French film ‘Cuties’ to more recent protests about Dave Chappelle’s jokes about trans women. To make expectations clear, the company revised its cultural guidelines for employees to explicitly say, “As employees we support the principle that Netflix offers a diversity of stories, even if we find some titles counter to our own personal values.” Stakeholder capitalism implicitly assumes a cultural consensus identical to whatever its advocates believe. It harks back to the mid-20th century, when big US companies enjoyed little competition, mass media marginalised all but a narrow range of political, religious, and social views, and hierarchy and security dominated worker expectations. It pretends social media, Slack channels and “bringing your whole self to work” don’t exist. For a purer version of what stakeholder-oriented management can engender, forget profits and political disagreements. Look at the turmoil roiling all sorts of Left-wing non-profits. In a report in the Intercept, Ryan Grim details why Washington DC-based groups have spent the past few years engaged in ‘knock-down, drag-out fights between competing factions of their organizations, most often breaking down along staff-versus-management lines.’ He writes that: ‘Instead of fueling a groundswell of public support to reinvigorate the [Democratic] party’s ambitious agenda, most of the foundation-backed organizations that make up the backbone of the party’s ideological infrastructure were still spending their time locked in virtual retreats, Slack wars, and healing sessions, grappling with tensions over hierarchy, patriarchy, race, gender, and power….’ Grim quotes the executive director of one such group, anonymously: “A lot of staff that work for me, they expect the organization to be all the things: a movement, OK, get out the vote, OK, healing, OK, take care of you when you’re sick, OK. It’s all the things,” said one executive director. “Can you get your love and healing at home, please? But I can’t say that, they would crucify me.” Despite their commitments to making the world a better place — and general agreement on what that means — trying to please every vocal stakeholder is wreaking such widespread organisational havoc that one group’s head, also quoted anonymously, told Grim “you couldn’t conceive of a better Right-wing plot to paralyze progressive leaders.” The problem isn’t that the groups are Leftist. It’s that their missions and decisions are constantly up for internal debate. New attitudes and forms of communication have destroyed the legitimacy of their managerial hierarchies. Compared with mission-oriented non-profits, businesses that focus on creating economic value are fortunate to have a clear definition of success. If they want to make the world a nicer place, they should strive to defend that standard. Virginia Postrel is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

4,"Taking Stock | Nifty back above 15,500, Sensex up 443 pts; auto stocks shine",stocks," The Indian benchmarks recouped most of the previous session losses and ended on a positive note in a highly volatile session on June 23 with the Nifty comfortably finishing above 15,500. At close, the Sensex was up 443.19 points or 0.86% at 52,265.72, and the Nifty was up 143.40 points or 0.93% at 15,556.70. After a flat start, the market gained the upside momentum as the day progressed. However, selling in the afternoon session erased the intraday losses, but buying in Auto, Information Technology, Pharma, and Realty names helped the market to close in the green. ""Indian markets opened on a positive note following Asian market peers which were trading mostly green led by China. During the afternoon session, markets trimmed some of their gains as European markets struggled to shrug off recession fears but managed to trade in the green,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. ""Buying in frontline stocks such as Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, and Bharti Airtel were aiding sentiment, while selling in Power Grid, Titan Co and NTPC kept the gains in the markets in check."" ""Traders were encouraged as Prime Minister Modi said the government expects the Indian economy to grow by 7.5% this year. Additional support came with RBI data showing that the country's foreign exchange reserves in nominal terms, including valuation effects, rose by $30.3 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal against a $99.2 billion expansion in FY2020-21,"" Solanki added. Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, M&M, and Bajaj Auto were among the top Nifty gainers. The losers were Reliance Industries, Coal India, NTPC, Power Grid Corporation, and Grasim Industries. Barring Energy, all the sectoral indices ended in the green. The Nifty Auto Index added 4.4 percent, while Information Technology and Pharma indices rose 2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Stock and sectors On the BSE, Auto Index rose 4.4 percent, while Capital Goods, Information Technology, Healthcare, and Realty indices gained 1 percent each. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices, too, added 1 percent each. A long build-up was seen in Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, and Eicher Motors, while a short build-up was seen in Interglobe Aviation, Torrent Power, and Manappuram Finance. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 200 percent was seen in Petronet LNG, Adani Ports, and Oracle Financial Services Software. Over 100 stocks hit their 52-week low on the BSE. These included Gujarat Gas, Muthoot Finance, Thyrocare Technologies, PNB Gilts, Tata Steel, Zee Learn, and DB Corp. On the other hand, Elecon Engineering, Kohinoor Foods, and Insecticides (India) touched their 52-week high. Outlook for June 24 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities: Nifty ended higher after a volatile trading session on the day of weekly expiry. On the daily chart, the Nifty registered a strong comeback after a day of decline in the previous session. The daily RSI is in positive divergence. The trend is likely to remain positive in the near term. Support on the lower end is placed at 15,400; a close below 15,400 may induce the resumption of a market sell-off. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 15,600/15,800. Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Research- Derivatives at Kotak Securities The Nifty trend remains weak with resistance seen at 15,870 - unless the same is crossed expect weakness to continue. Short-term volatility continues to remain high. Broadly, expect pressure to continue while limited stock-specific risk definable opportunities are available. Select Auto, banking, and Midcap energy stocks look attractive from a risk perspective. Expect continuous selling pressure in the Metals space. Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities: Markets witnessed a roller coaster ride till mid-session before rebounding to comfortably settle in positive territory at close on hectic buying activity in IT, automobile & realty stocks. The fall in the crude oil prices gave some respite to the market, although concerns of persistent FII selling and rising bond yields in the US will continue to keep traders on the edge. Technically, for the last three days, the market has been witnessing non-directional activity. For Nifty, 15,400 and 15,600 are the important levels to watch out and below the same, the index could slip up to 15,340-15,300. On the flip side, 15,600 would be the key breakout level for the bulls. Above which, the index is likely to hit the level of 15,720-15,800. Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty has stepped into a short-term consolidation mode recently & accordingly it is witnessing range-bound action. The index witnessed sharp swings from 15,400-15,600 on June 23. On the higher side, 15,670-15,700, which was earlier acting as a support zone, is now posing as a resistance zone as per the principle of role reversal. The Nifty is facing selling pressure as it is approaching this area. Unless the level of 15,700 gets taken out on a closing basis, the index is expected to stay in a consolidation mode. On the downside, 15,400-15,360 is the near-term support zone, below which the index can test the recent low near 15,183."
5,"Auto stocks shrug weak sentiment, remain outliers since March lows",stocks," Auto stocks have been on an upward trajectory since March lows despite two intermittent corrections, even when the benchmark indices are getting serious threats from bears. In March 2022, the headline indices hit a one-year low as well as the lowest level since July 2021. And, last week too, both the Sensex and Nifty hit their fresh 52-week lows on the BSE, tracking weakness in the global counterparts given the faster policy tightening by the Fed and other central banks amid elevated inflation figures. This suggests that the domestic equities have fallen way below the March 2022 low, though there was a bit of recovery later led by short covering in most beaten-down stocks. ""Markets are already pricing in a lot of bad news and outcomes. There is consensus that inflation will continue to be sticky, interest rates will rise, the US dollar will continue to strengthen, the oil will get to $150 a barrel and Ukraine situation will not get resolved in a hurry,"" Abhay Agarwal, Founder and Fund Manager at Piper Serica said. A very high probability of recession and stagflation has now been built into the models, the expert feels. Therefore, any positive surprise can provide a sharp turnaround to the market since there is a lot of under-ownership with cash sitting on the sidelines, Agarwal said. But Auto index turned out to be the biggest outlier since March lows, even when the global mood is gloomy. Also read - Moneycontrol Market Sentiment Survey | Fund managers buying largecaps stocks in downturn, prefer banks most If we go by the data points, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 14 percent between March 8 and June 22, 2022, whereas in the same period, the Nifty50 index declined nearly 4 percent. Among individual stocks, Mahindra & Mahindra rallied 40 percent during the window while TVS Motor rose 39 percent. Ashok Leyland has gained 34 percent and Eicher Motors 18 percent. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, and Balkrishna Industries gained 10-14 percent. However, three scrips - Amara Raja Batteries, Bosch, and Exide Industries have been losers among the 15-share Auto index. Even on June 23, the Nifty Auto index climbed 3.7 percent at the time of writing this report, as Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, M&M, Tata Motors, and TVS Motor Company gained 3-6 percent. In fact, every stock in the sector was in the positive territory. Even in the last two downcycles, especially after hitting March lows, the index has not seen a similar kind of correction as witnessed by the Nifty50. Also read - IT will continue to receive tailwinds from strong deal activity and digital transformation After March lows, Nifty50 dropped 13 percent from April 4 till May 12 and 9.6 percent during June 3-June 20. In the same period, the Auto index declined 6.6 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. One reason behind the recovery in the Auto space could be a fall in metal prices and supply chains seem to be gradually normalising. Steel is the main material for the automobile industry. ""Autos is another space that will benefit as steel prices cool off and supply chains for key components come back. The domestic demand is robust and a good monsoon will support rural demand, especially for two-wheelers,"" said Abhay Agarwal. Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research also said the auto sector which was the laggard in the previous year is surging since March as the supply side as well as demand issues are getting resolved. ""Volumes are increasing and with the latest government move to reduce steel prices, margins are going to ease. We have added 2-wheelers in our portfolios last month and we also expect tractors and passenger vehicles to gain traction as the rural demand recovers,"" she added. The Nifty Metal index crashed 34 percent from its high of the current year at 6,826 levels on April 11, to 4,491 levels on June 22, following a correction in global metal prices. In fact, it was the biggest loser during the period, when Auto was flat and Nifty50 corrected nearly 13 percent."

Minutes of the latest policy meeting show that the same cannot be said about the subsequent rate decision, as members of the rate-setting panel believe that the economic recovery still needs to be nurtured.

14,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with Matrimony, Sterling Tools, IOL Chemicals, ITI, Trident on Thursday?",stocks," The market failed to extend its positive momentum seen in previous session as weak global sentiment and selling pressure in every sector pulled benchmark indices down on June 22. The BSE Sensex fell more than 700 points to 51,823 and the Nifty50 plunged more than 200 points to 15,413 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on daily charts. The Stochastic has given a negative crossover, clearly indicating that sentiments are weak at the moment, while the India VIX, which gauges the expected volatility in the market, remained above 20 levels, suggesting continuity in volatile swings in the market and the trend could remain in favour of bears. The VIX rose by 0.74 percent to 21.30 levels. Broader markets also reeled under pressure after a sharp rebound in the previous session. The Nifty Midcap 100 index declined 1.6 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell 1.4 percent as about five shares declined for every two advancing shares on the NSE. But there were several stocks that outperformed the broader space in the falling markets including ITI which surged 17 percent to Rs 104, Matrimony which gained 6.7 percent at Rs 823, Sterling Tools which climbed 6 percent to Rs 238.5, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals which rose 3.3 percent to Rs 321, and Trident which jumped 4.4 percent to Rs 38. Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Sterling Tools On the weekly chart, the counter is near resistance levels of approximately Rs 260. Over the last couple of years, the stock has been rejected two times from Rs 260 levels, so one should wait for any fresh buying as of now. If already holding position, then one should book some profits at current market price. Last but not the least fresh buying in the counter will only trigger once it successfully closes above Rs 260 and settles in.  Trident At current juncture, Trident is in crucial support zone of Rs 35-36 (see chart). Moreover, at the said levels, we have seen Bullish Engulfing which was made on June 21 along with volume picking up and it is a sign of positive momentum. One should buy, hold and add at current market price with upside potential till Rs 45 with downside support of Rs 35.  Matrimony Matrimony has given nice upmove in the last session but the major hurdle of Rs 878 is still intact. From Ichimoku Cloud point of view, the stock is above cloud which is a positive sign but T-K cross is not visible clearly. So one should wait for Matrimony to close above Rs 878 and settle in, then only fresh buy will trigger.  IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals The counter has corrected almost 60 percent from its recent high of Rs 537 in April. At current juncture, the stock is taking support near potential reversal zone (Rs 310-325) of bullish bat pattern. Moreover, we are getting extra confirmation from Bullish Harami candlestick pattern which was made on June 21. One can buy this at current levels with upside potential of Rs 380 and downside support is at Rs 295.  ITI In the previous session we witnessed massive rally of 17 percent. Though upmove is massive but on weekly chart there is a lot of resistance seen from Rs 106-115. No fresh buying is advised if you are holding this; start booking in the range of Rs 110 -115 because we may witness strong selling pressure from resistance levels. "

16,"Sun TV Network, 2 others on NSE ban list for F&O trade today",stocks," Media company Sun TV Network has been added to the list of stocks that are under the F&O ban for June 23 by the National Stock Exchange after the stock crossed 95 percent of the market-wide position limit. Sun TV has seen the highest short build-up among 122 stocks, which corrected nearly 9 percent to close at Rs 408.6 amid high volumes on the NSE. On the technical front, it has seen a formation of large bearish candle as the closing was way lower than opening levels. Indiabulls Housing Finance and RBL Bank are already on the list even as the former fell 3 percent to Rs 98.9 and the latter gained nearly 3 percent at Rs 85.55. If derivative contracts in a security cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, they end up on the ban list, the NSE said. “All clients/members shall trade in the derivative contracts of the said security only to decrease their positions through offsetting positions. Any increase in open positions shall attract appropriate penal and disciplinary action,” it said. During the ban, traders are not allowed to take fresh positions in stocks but can start reducing their positions. The F&O ban rule helps reduce speculation in stocks. The market-wide position limit, which is set by stock exchanges, is the maximum number of outstanding open positions (buy and sell) in the F&O contracts of a security. If the open interest in a stock crosses 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, its F&O contracts enter the ban period."

1,"Taking Stock | Back in the red, Sensex and Nifty down more than 1%; metals top drag",stocks," The Indian equity benchmarks were back to their losing ways after two days on June 22 on weak global cues and selling across sectors, overlooking the fall in crude oil prices. At close, the Sensex was down 709.54 points, or 1.35 percent, at 51,822.53, and the Nifty was down 225.50 points, or 1.44 percent, at 15,413.30. Oil prices tumbled amid a push by US President Joe Biden to cut taxes on fuel to cut costs for drivers amid aggravated relations between the White House and the oil industry, news agency Reuters reported. Benchmark Brent crude futures were down $4.65, or 4.1 percent, at $110 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell $5.08, or 4.6 percent, to $104.44, it added. ""The short-lived pull-back rally displays the level of uncertainty in today’s market. The weakness in the global market due to quantitative tightening pulled the market down. The US Fed chair’s testimony later in the day will be keenly watched for clues about the central banks’ future dot-plot,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Hindalco Industries, UPL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Wipro were among the top Nifty losers. The gainers were BPCL, Hero MotoCorp, TCS, Maruti Suzuki and Power Grid Corporation. In now an all-familiar script, all sectoral indices ended in the red. The Nifty metal index was down 4.8 percent, while Nifty bank, pharma, information technology and energy indices were down 1-2 percent. Stock and sectors On the BSE, the metal index was the top loser with a 5 percent fall. Capital goods, healthcare, IT, oil & gas, power and realty indices were down 1-2 percent. The BSE midcap index fell 1.5 percent and the smallcap index shed 1 percent. A short build-up was seen in Sun TV Network, Hindustan Copper and NALCO, while a long build-up was seen in Indiabulls Housing, Indian Hotels and Concor. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 200 percent was seen in United Breweries, Dixon Technologies and Sun TV Network. More than 100 stocks hit their 52-week low on the BSE. These included Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, UPL, Symphony, SpiceJet, Shipping Corporation Of India, JK Cement and IDFC First Bank. Outlook for June 23 Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities The Nifty on June 22 gave up almost all the gains made on the previous day. Asian shares were mostly lower as markets shrugged off a rally in the US and awaited congressional testimony of Fed chair Jerome Powell. European stocks hit a fresh one-year low on, as a fall in oil and metal prices hurt commodity-related stocks. Markets have fallen sharply on below-normal volumes, suggesting lack of adequate buying to offset the selling pressure. Now, the Nifty has support at 15,293-15,350 band, while on upmoves, it can face resistance at 15,565 and 15,670. Shrikant Chouhan, Head, Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities Markets declined once again as panic-stricken investors, taking cues from an early slump in European indices and weakness in other Asian gauges, dumped equities, especially metal, power and realty stocks. The market is very fragile, as any negative sign is prompting traders to exit stocks at will. Technically, the Nifty has also formed a bearish candle, which suggests further weakness. On intraday charts, the index has formed non- directional formation, while the texture is suggesting that range-bound activity is likely to continue. For traders, 15,500 will act as an immediate resistance level, above which it can rally to 15,600-15,650. On the flip side, 15,350 could be the key support level to watch out for. Below it, the index can slide to 15,250-15,200. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The Nifty slipped lower after a volatile trading session. On the higher end, 15,500 remains the level of resistance. The trend will likely remain weak if the Nifty stays below 15,500. On the lower end, support is visible at 15,300.

7,Rolling returns: 7 out of 10 times this paint stock turned multibagger if held for 3 years,stocks," India’s top three paint companies—Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Kansai Nerolac—have been consistent wealth- creators for several years now. A Moneycontrol analysis found that an investor who stayed with any of these companies for a three-year period in the past 15 years (June 2007-June 2022) saw their investment double most of the time. We calculated and analysed three-year rolling returns for these firms over the last 15 years. Rolling returns are useful for examining the behaviour of returns for a selected time frame. They are considered more accurate than the performance in a single instance. Data shows that among the three companies, Bergers Paints maintains the best three-year rolling returns, giving investors more than 100 percent return on investment almost 70 percent of the time (or 2,470 days out of 3,716 days). Asian Paints did the same 60 percent of the time and Kansai Nerolac Paints about 50 percent of the time.  Even in absolute terms, Bergers Paints leads the pack with a 3,244 percent price return for the 15-year period. Asian Paints surged about 3,038 percent, and Kansai Nerolac Paints 1,006 percent, while the Nifty gained 261 percent during the period.  The industry has changed over the last 15 years as many new players have entered the market, which has led to a decline in the market share of the Big 3. Companies are also facing profit-margin pressure due to high input costs. Moneycontrol SWOT analysis reveals that Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac look a bit weak, while Berger Paints has more strengths than weaknesses.  "

The research firm believes that the correction in the stock offers opportunity adding that there are tailwinds to refining margin in CY22. According to Jefferies', multi-year low inventories, declining Russian exports, muted Chinese exports, lower diesel production in Europe and delays in commissioning of ME refineries are tailwinds to refining margins in CY22. ""Reliance Industries is a key beneficiary of energy inflation, with every $1 per barrel improvement in annualised refining margins, adding an estimated $400-450 million to RIL's consolidated EBITDA. Our initial estimates suggest RIL's oil-to-chemical business EBITDA could rise 60 percent on quarter in Q1 this year and account for 35 percent of our FY23 estimate. Continued strength in refining should result in consensus FY23 earnings upgrades,"" it said. The stock has corrected 10 percent from its recent peak. ""We reiterate buy with Rs 2,950 as the target price,"" it added. Catch all the market action on our live blog JP Morgan had earlier upgraded its rating on Reliance to overweight from neutral and raised the target to Rs 3,170 from Rs 2,575 per share, implying an upside of more than 24 percent over the next 12 months. It said that its rating upgrade is driven by improvement in earnings outlook of the refining and upstream gas business as well as the consumer technology businesses’ valuations holding. JP Morgan believes the firm's outperformance to Nifty50 will continue in 2022 given that there is a good chance of upgrades to Street’s earnings expectations for the company. The brokerage has raised its earnings per share estimate by 19 percent for 2022-23 and 17 percent for 2023-24. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

11,Bear Market Woes: 83% of Nifty 500 stocks give negative returns in 2022,stocks," The ongoing downturn in the domestic stock market has seen nearly 83 percent of the stocks forming the Nifty 500 index, a collection of the biggest companies in the country, deliver flat or negative returns in 2022 so far. Many of these stocks are hovering below their 52-week lows and their 200-day moving average (DMA), data compiled by Moneycontrol showed. So far this year, the Nifty 500 index lost 12 percent, while the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have declined nearly 10 percent each. Companies that have seen the most erosion in their stock prices since the start of this year include Dhani Services, Solara Active Pharma, Brightcom Group, Indiabulls Real Estate, Metropolis Healthcare, Hikal, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dilip Buildcon, Welspun India, Nazara Tech, One97 Communications, Zomato and Sterlite Tech, which have lost 40-80 percent. Nifty 50 stocks such as Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, BPCL, IndusInd Bank, Shree Cement, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Wipro, Infosys, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, and Grasim Industries hit one-year lows recently. All these stocks are down between 8-40 percent this year. ""The broader market has been under pressure mainly due to the heavy FII selling. Concerns of premium valuation and higher impact of inflation on their profitability led to sharper fall in broader markets"" said Sneha Poddar, AVP, Research Analyst, Broking and Distribution, MOFSL However, the sharp correction in the market is also being seen as an opportunity by some market participants. “I think it's the right time for long-term investors to add to good growth stocks, which are available at attractive valuations,” Narendra Solanki, Head-Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said. Solanki believes investors should continue to hold existing stocks in their portfolios, if growth prospects of the company are intact as the “current volatility is more in the short-to-medium term, while long-term prospects for our economy remain promising”. Analysts attribute the negative or low returns in some popular consumer durables, auto, banking, realty and metal stocks that are actively traded in futures and options (F&O) on the perception that higher cost of borrowing and product prices will hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with persistently high input prices. Metal stocks have already been under pressure since the government’s decision to impose export duty on steel to cool domestic prices. Among IT stocks, volatility in the global markets amid higher inflation and expectations of tightening by central banks, along with the Russia-Ukraine war, which is unlikely to end soon, may see a slowdown in order books. Most Indian IT companies are moving their operations out of Russia, while helping clients maintain business continuity by shifting work to other locations. This is likely to increase margin pressures further, analysts said. Oil & gas stocks were under pressure as investors feared that interest rate hikes from major central banks could slow the global economy and cut demand for energy. Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher expects markets to remain volatile for the next three months as he believes inflation is likely to remain high and geo political tensions will not end soon."

13,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with MCX India, Adani Total Gas, JSW Energy on Wednesday?",stocks," The market posted nearly 2 percent gain on June 21 as short-covering and long build-up in beaten down stocks and positive global cues lifted sentiment. The BSE Sensex climbed more than 900 points to 52,532 and the Nifty50 jumped nearly 290 points to 15,639 as breadth was strong. The broader markets also joined the bull run as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rallied around 3.5 percent each. More than five shares advanced for every declining share on the NSE. The volatility also dipped, helping the bulls to get back at Dalal Street. India VIX, which measures the expected volatility in the market, fell by 5.66 percent to 21.14 levels. If it drops below 20 mark then there could be more stability in the market, experts said. Stocks that were in action included Adani Total Gas which rallied 20 percent to Rs 2,383, MCX India which climbed 6.5 percent to Rs 1,247 and JSW Energy which jumped 8 percent to Rs 211.4. Here's what Ruchit Jain of 5paise.com, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: MCX India In last three months, the stock has been consolidating in a broad range of Rs 1,140-1,500. The entire consolidation has been seen below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) which indicates a negative trend. However, within this broad consolidation the stock prices were trading near the support range and a pullback move in the broader markets led to an up move in the stock from its support. In the near term, the prices could approach the higher end of the range where resistances are seen around Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,500. Traders should use such pullback moves to lighten up longs and wait for a resumption of its uptrend for fresh entry. The immediate support is placed around Rs 1,140 below which, the stock would then resume its downtrend.  Adani Total Gas The stock witnessed some correction in last few days but as the stock approached its '200 days EMA', it witnessed buying interest which resulted in a 20 percent upmove. In recent past as well, the '20 days EMA' had acted as a support and prices had resumed the positive trend. Thus, this support which is placed around Rs 1,900 is a sacrosanct and the broader trend remains positive till this is intact. However, the ‘RSI Smoothed’ oscillator on the monthly charts is in an overbought zone and hence, a time-wise correction could not be ruled out where prices would consolidate in a broad range. Traders with existing positions can keep a stop-loss below the above mentioned support. On upside, the resistances are seen around Rs 2,625 and Rs 2,740.  JSW Energy The stock has been correcting along with the broader market since the month of October. The stock has been forming a 'Lower Top lower Bottom’ formation on the daily chart and hence seems to be retracing its previous uptrend. But the momentum readings are in the oversold zone and hence, near term pullback could be seen. The stock can see an up move towards its resistances of Rs 235 and Rs 250 in the near term. On the flipside, the immediate support is placed in the range of Rs 185-175. "
14,"Hot Stocks | PVR, Elecon Engineering, J Kumar Infraprojects can fetch 12-20% return in short term. Here's why",stocks," Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart The Nifty50 is witnessing an astute recovery from 15,180 levels followed by a major downfall of more than 1,600 points from 16,800 levels. If we look at the derivative data, the long exposure of FIIs in the Index future hiked to 15 percent from their multi-year low of 11 percent, whereas the Put-Call ratio is also in an oversold zone of 0.81. Technically, 15,800-15,850 is a critical susceptible zone; above this, we can expect the level of 16,000 in the near term while on the downside, if the Nifty slips below 15,400 level, then 15,180 is the next support level. The derivative data represents a slightly oversold situation that may help in a short-covering bounce. Bank Nifty has crossed its psychological level of 33,000 in Tuesday's trading session, however, 33,800 is an immediate and critical supply level; above this, 34,000 will be the next resistance level. On the downside, 33,000 is the major demand level; below this 32,250-32,000 will be the next support levels. Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks: Elecon Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 259.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 224 | Target: Rs 294 | Return: 13 percent There is a classical bullish setup as the counter is forming a Bullish Flag formation. It is trading above its all-important moving averages. Momentum indicators are positively poised to support the current strength of the trend. On the upside, Rs 284-294 are the immediate target levels while 50-DMA (day moving average) of Rs 230 is an immediate support level and below this Rs 224 is the next demand level.  PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,782.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,672 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 12 percent The counter is witnessing a breakout of triangle pattern formation to resume its classical uptrend. It is respecting its 200-DMA which is currently placed at the Rs 1,640 level. Most of the momentum indicators are positively poised and indicate further rally in this counter.  J Kumar Infraprojects: Buy | LTP: Rs 279.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 240 | Target: Rs 336 | Return: 20 percent The counter has a strong bullish setup where it witnessed a breakout of Descending triangle breakout on the longer timeframe. It has retested its previous breakout Rs 240 level after hitting a fresh 52-week high. On the upside, Rs 300 is an immediate resistance area; above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 336 levels in the near term. On the downside, Rs 240 is major support at any correction. "

0,"Taking Stock | Sensex up 934 points, Nifty above 15,600; mid, smallcaps also gain",stocks," Indian equity benchmark extended gains for the second day on June 21, lifted by buying across sectors, especially in metals and IT names, and falling commodity prices. At close, the Sensex was up 934.23 points, or 1.81 percent, at 52,532.07, while the Nifty added 288.65 points, or, 1.9 percent to close at 15,638.80, their best performance in three weeks. ""Absence of fresh selling triggers in the domestic and global economy along with falling commodity prices relieved the heavily discounted equity market to showcase recovery,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. The recovery indicates that the uncertainty over inflation and monetary policy tightening has been factored in, however, with the market in a highly sensitive state, even the slightest inconvenience can trigger volatility, he added. Titan Company, Hindalco Industries, JSW Steel, Coal India and Adani Ports were among the top Nifty gainers. All the sectoral indices ended in the green, with Nifty auto, IT, energy, metal, pharma and PSU bank rising 2-4 percent. Also Read: Sensex spikes over 1,000 points: Four factors behind the market rally Stock and sectors On the BSE, all sectoral indices ended higher led by oil & gas (up 6 percent) and power, realty, IT and metal indices up 3 percent each. Broader indices outperformed the benchmarks. The BSE midcap index jumped 2.4 percent and smallcap index added 3 percent. A short build-up was seen in RBL Bank, Indiabulls Housing and GNFC, while long build-up was seen in Indiamart Intermesh, Multi Commodity Exchange of India and SBI Cards. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 100 percent was seen in Delta Corp, IDFC First Bank and IDFC. More than 100 stocks hit their 52-week low on the BSE. These included BPCL, NCC, Vivimed Labs, IDFC First Bank, JK Cement, V-Mart Retail and Jaiprakash Associates. Outlook for June 22 Ajit Mishra, VP- Research, Religare Broking All the sectors participated in the rally, wherein media, PSU banks and metals gained the most. This move has certainly eased some pressure but sustainability is the key. Participants are keenly eyeing the US Fed chair’s speech for cues and are tracking the progress of the monsoon. A decisive move above 15,700 in the Nifty can take it to the 16,000 or decline will resume. Stocks, on the other hand, are offering opportunities on both sides, so traders should plan accordingly. Siddhartha Khemka, Head-Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services The markets witnessed the much-needed relief rally after posting the worst weekly losses in two years. Positive global cues, a fall in crude oil prices and short covering in the derivatives segment drove the market. Value buying in beaten-down sectors also helped the market gain some momentum. Globally, equity markets continue to worry about the expected aggressive rate hikes by central banks to curb record inflation and its impact on economic growth. On the positive side, crude prices have corrected almost 10 percent from its recent peak, providing some breather to the market s India meets 80 percent of its energy needs through imports. While the overall market set up continues to be “sell on rise”, intermittent bouts of relief rally can’t be ruled out. Given the hawkish commentaries from central banks and record-high inflation, the rate hike cycle is likely to continue over the next couple of months and keep markets jittery. Shrikant Chouhan, Head, Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities With no negative cues, the benchmark indices gained for the second straight day. Metal, state-owned banks and technology stocks saw bargain hunting after suffering heavy losses in the week gone by. On daily charts, the Nifty has formed a promising bullish candle, which supports a further uptrend but the medium-term trend is still on the weak side. For the traders, the support has shifted to 15,500 from 15,250 on the Nifty and from 51,300 to 52,000 on BSE. As long as the Nifty traded above 15,500, its chances of hitting 15,750 are bright. A further upside could take the index to 15,850."

4,Buy NTPC; target of Rs 170: Sharekhan,stocks," Sharekhan's research report on NTPC The recent sharp 17% fall in NTPC’s stock price from its 52-week high is unwarranted given risk-averse earnings model and a healthy dividend yield of 5%. Also, NTPC’s market capitalisation ignores long-term value creation from large renewable energy (RE) expansion plans. We maintain a Buy on NTPC with an unchanged PT of Rs. 170; FY24E P/BV attractive at 0.9x. NTPC’s standalone regulated equity base would clock a 12% CAGR over FY22-24E led by robust commercialization plan of 5GW/6GW in FY23E/FY24E. This coupled with sustained high plant load factor (PLF) for thermal assets and better coal availability (captive coal production grew 27% y-o-y to 14 mt in FY22) to drive 16% CAGR in standalone PAT over FY22-24E along with decent RoE of ~14%. Strong operating cash flows (up 31% y-o-y to Rs. . 35,388 crore in FY22) and low cost debt (high credit rating) to help drive transition towards RE capacities (60GW target by FY32 or 46% of capacity versus 3% currently), which would create significant value and drive re-rating besides addressing ESG concerns for NTPC.  Outlook Potential monetisation of NTPC Green Energy Limited through induction of strategic investor and an IPO at a later stage could unlock value from RE business. More Info At 12:32 hrs NTPC was quoting at Rs 138.40, up Rs 1.00, or 0.73 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 139.65 and an intraday low of Rs 137.55.

The share touched its 52-week high Rs 166.30 and 52-week low Rs 111.95 on 19 April, 2022 and 26 August, 2021, respectively. Currently, it is trading 16.78 percent below its 52-week high and 23.63 percent above its 52-week low. Market capitalisation stands at Rs 134,201.86 crore.

5,Buy Dhanuka Agritech; target of Rs 870: Prabhudas Lilladher,stocks," Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Dhanuka Agritech We interacted with senior management of Dhanuka Agritech (Dhanuka) to take an update on the business and outlook, going forward. Key highlights are (a) Delayed start of monsoons have kept ground sentiments lower; (b) weak rainfall in first 20 days (down 8% YoY on a PAN India basis); however major deficiency witnessed in key agricultural belts of central, western and Southern India; (c) 1QFY23 revenue growth for industry likely to be subdued (low double digit growth on a lower base of last year); (d) have taken price hikes of 3-4% across portfolio to pass on inflated cost; (e) RM prices remained stable, led by lower demand in domestic market; (f) Green-field project in Dahej remains well on track.

We believe that next few weeks would be crucial for the industry in terms of 1HFY23 performance (contributing ~60% of the annual revenues). Outlook However, pick-up in rainfall and sowing activities coupled with remunerative crop prices and lower base impact should bode well for the kharif season. We largely keep our estimates unchanged and would be watchful on how monsoons pan out over the next few weeks. Maintain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR870 based on 15xFY24E EPS.

6,Two-wheeler stocks see buying on renewed optimism for rural demand recovery,stocks," Shares of two-wheeler companies were in demand on June 21 amid renewed optimism for recovery in demand as the southwest monsoon accelerated its progress after a delay. The monsoon rain deficit has reduced to 5 percent of the long-term average as compared to 25 percent a few days ago, data available with the Indian Meteorological Department shows. “This improvement is largely attributed to the east and the Northeast region, as the rest of India continues to witness deficient rainfall, albeit lower than in the previous weeks,” said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services. These June-September rains are vital for India as they water almost 50 percent of its farmland.  This is also the time for the sowing of rice, sugarcane, cotton and other summer crops. Normal monsoon rainfall is seen as critical for the revival of rural demand, which has seen a sharp downturn over the past year due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation and stagnating income. Several fast-moving consumer goods companies had started flagging concerns over the slowdown in the rural economy over the past two quarters as consumers downtraded on purchases due to higher prices. Click here for live market updates For two-wheeler companies like Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp the rural market constitutes a large chunk of their revenues and volumes. In 2021-22, two-wheeler companies reported a double-digit decline in volumes given a rural slowdown, high cost of ownership and production challenges. Edelweiss Securities’ Abneesh Roy believes that the reduction in rain deficit is positive for all consumer names as a normal rainfall will lead to demand revival in rural India. Earlier in the session, shares of Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp were largely driven by the covering of short positions in both stocks by traders, while those of TVS Motor saw the addition of long positions. At 11.40 am, shares of Bajaj Auto were up 1 percent at Rs 3,650.8 on the National Stock Exchange, while those of Hero Moto were higher by 1.8 percent at Rs 2,497. Shares of TVS Motor were up 1.5 percent at Rs 741.60."
7,Neutral Tata Steel; target of Rs 965: Motilal Oswal,stocks," Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel We believe Tata Steel standalone’s 1HFY23 EBITDA is likely to contract by 66% over 1HFY22 driven by lower ASP, lower demand and peak coking coal costs and high base effect. India operations will not benefit from lower iron ore costs or discounted Russian coal. Hence, the cost structure will only benefit from the reduction in coking coal prices that too for 70-75% of requirement as India operations are captive on coking coal for the balance. We cut our FY23E consolidated EBITDA by 22%, driven by 34% reduction in standalone EBITDA, partially offset by 4% increase in TSE EBITDA. The reduction in domestic EBITDA is driven by: a) lower than expected sales volume, b) reduction in ASP and c) higher than estimated coking coal cost.  Outlook We maintain our Neutral rating on Tata Steel with revised TP of INR 965 (vs INR 1,410 earlier) based on SoTP. More Info At 11:00 hrs Tata Steel was quoting at Rs 866.70, up Rs 5.50, or 0.64 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 882.00 and an intraday low of Rs 864.00. It was trading with volumes of 213,404 shares, compared to its thirty day average of 562,270 shares, a decrease of -62.05 percent. In the previous trading session, the share closed down 5.03 percent or Rs 45.65 at Rs 861.20. The share touched its 52-week high Rs 1,534.60 and 52-week low Rs 843.00 on 16 August, 2021 and 20 June, 2022, respectively. Currently, it is trading 43.52 percent below its 52-week high and 2.81 percent above its 52-week low.

8,HDFC AMC surges as Kotak Equities upgrades rating to ‘add’,stocks," Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company rose on June 21 after brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded the stock to ‘add’ as it believes negatives for the company are now adequately represented in the stock price. Shares of HDFC AMC have fallen more than 38 percent over the past one year on account of concerns over its loss of market share in the equity mutual fund schemes, and shrinking margins due to higher commissions for distributors. Kotak Equities believes given the current stock price and valuation of the company investors should look beyond the near-term headwinds and a potential for turnaround in operations. “We see a positive few drivers which are likely to play out for HDFC AMC over the medium-term,” Kotak Equities said in a note on June 21. The brokerage firm argued that HDFC AMC’s equity funds have seen a meaningful improvement in performance with 70 percent of its equity assets under management now in the first or second quartile of performance on a one-year basis. “Consistent outperformance will likely drive improvement in flow market share over the medium-term. HDFC AMC’s more defensive equity AUM mix (higher share of balanced/flexi funds) will also provide support during market drawdowns,” Kotak Equities said. Further, Kotak Equities believes HDFC’s impending merger with HDFC Bank could help sales going ahead as HDFC AMC has one of the lowest share of sales through bank channels among large mutual funds. Following a sharp rise in commission rates alongside heightened new fund offer activity, Kotak Equities also sees early signs of distributor commissions normalising, which should aid recovery in the asset manager’s margins. That said, Kotak Equities has cut its price target for the stock to Rs 1,900 from Rs 1,975 earlier as it has cut its earnings estimate for the company to reflect lower future assets under management growth of 13 percent over the next two years. “While we recognize that turn-around in flows driven by performance is unlikely to be immediate, especially given the present state of the markets, we believe current valuations post the de-rating provide a balanced risk-reward,” Kotak Equities said.

9,Tata Steel operating profit estimates slashed by brokerages,stocks," Tata Steel share price came into focus after Citi maintained a buy call on the stock. The stock has tanked over 32 percent in the last 3 months amid inflation, interest rate hikes and export duty concerns. At 09:50 am, the stock was trading at Rs 877, up Rs 15.80 or 1.83 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 882.00 and an intraday low of Rs 865.10. Metal stocks have been under pressure from lockdowns and slowdown in China. Central banks raising interest rates to mitigate inflationary pressures and an expected economic slowdown are also major reasons for the decline. The government surprised the industry with an export duty with effect from May 22. The duty is 50 percent on all grades of iron ore, 45 percent on pellets and 15 percent on non-alloy steel except part of semi-finished steel. According to the Indian Steel Association (ISA), the duty on steel would send a negative signal to investors and impact capacity utilisation. India could lose export opportunities and the decision could impact overall economic activity, it said. Catch all the market action on our live blog Analysts said that duty on iron ore may result in higher domestic supply and will likely bring down prices. For steel firms like Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL, exports account for 15-20 percent of overall sales. Global research firm Citi has retained a buy rating on Tata Steel but has cut target to Rs 1,085 from Rs 1,800 per share. It has cut EBITDA estimate by 32/34% on lower realisations. ""Tata Steel stock may not hit the 2020 trough of 0.5x given China stimulus expectations. Balance sheet is also strong, perhaps strongest in the last 15 years,"" it added. According to a Motilal Oswal research report, Tata Steel will not benefit from inexpensive ore and Russian coal. It believes Tata Steel standalone 1HFY23 EBITDA is likely to contract by 66% over 1HFY22 driven by lower ASP, lower demand and peak coking coal costs and high base effect. ""India operations will not benefit from lower iron ore costs or discounted Russian coal. Hence, the cost structure will only benefit from the reduction in coking coal prices that too for 70-75% of requirement as India operations are captive on coking coal for the balance,"" it said. Motilal Oswal has cut FY23E consolidated EBITDA by 22%, driven by 34% reduction in standalone EBITDA offset by 4% increase in TSE EBITDA. The reduction in domestic EBITDA is a combination of lower than expected sales volume, reduction in ASP and higher than estimated coking coal cost. It has maintained its neutral rating on Tata Steel with a revised target of Rs 965 (against Rs 1,410 earlier) based on SoTP."
10,Gland Pharma surges as CLSA India initiates coverage with buy rating,stocks," Shares of Gland Pharma rose on June 21 after brokerage firm CLSA India initiated a coverage on the stock with a ‘buy’ rating on expectation that the company will benefit from increasing shift of research and development outsourcing by western drug giants out of China. “Western firms seeking to diversify their supply chains creates an enriching environment, and Indian firms have an advantage in their access to a large and low-cost science-literate workforce,” CLSA India said in a note. The brokerage firm said that the pharma outsourcing market in India expects to grow at 11 percent on an annual basis over the next four years to a $200-billion industry by 2026. “As innovators strive to lower their R&D costs and improve efficiency, the pace of outsourcing is set to increase,” CLSA said. The brokerage firm expects companies like Gland Pharma to benefit increasingly from the emerging trend even though it argued that Indian companies are constrained by policies, funding and talent to foster widespread innovation. Besides having a diversified global client base, CLSA believes that companies like Gland Pharma also have high entry barriers in their respective niche, given steep upfront investment in setting up a lab or manufacturing facility, long gestation periods, high switching costs for the innovator and, more importantly, ability to protect the intellectual property. The brokerage firm expects Gland Pharma to deliver 15-20 percent growth in revenues over the next three years, which is higher than its long-term average. “We also forecast gradual margin expansion and improvement in return ratios as they integrate their product offerings and improve utilisation of their assets,” the brokerage house said.

0,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with Pidilite Industries, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC on Tuesday?",stocks," The market seems to be oversold and hence it snapped six-day losing streak with support from FMCG, and IT stocks and the HDFC twins on June 20. The BSE Sensex gained more than 200 points to close at 51,598, while the Nifty50 defended its Friday's low of 15,183 and rose 57 points to 15,350. However, auto, metal, realty and select banks stocks remained under pressure. The broader markets also stayed under control of bears on weak breadth. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 2.3 percent and 3.2 percent respectively as about six shares declined for every share rising on the NSE. India VIX, the fear index that measures volatility in the market, fell by 1.51 percent to 22.41 levels, indicating that the market was volatile and in favour of bears. Stocks that were in action and sharply outperformed frontline indices included Pidilite Industries, HUL and HDFC which were among top five gainers in the futures & options segment on Monday. Pidilite Industries gained 5.4 percent at Rs 2,106.65, Hindustan Unilever rose 4 percent t Rs 2,196, and HDFC climbed 4 percent to Rs 2,135. Here's what Vidnyan Sawant of GEPL Capital recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:. Pidilite Industries On longer term charts, Pidilite Industries was moving in a strong uptrend since March 2020. Post August 2021, the stock started to consolidate in a broader range while forming a topping Head and Shoulder pattern. On the weekly charts, prices formed an Inverted Hammer candle pattern after retesting the neckline which again was followed by a faster retracement of the previous swing. Also the 13 weeks exponential moving average (EMA) which was acting as a strong support to prices has lost its validity and is acting as resistance. On daily charts, the stock has been sustaining below its 200 days simple moving average (SMA) since last one month indicating negative sentiments of the stock. The RSI indicator on weekly time frame is below 50 which indicated bearish tone in the stock. We advise traders and investors to exit the positions from Pidilite Industries. Upside resistance for the stock is placed at Rs 2,200 level.  Hindustan Unilever Hindustan Unilever has seen an exceptional uptrend since October 2018. The stock after such an elongated rally saw lower low formation, lower high formation since November 2021. The stock on the weekly time frame broke the trend line which was respected very well since October 2018, and started acting as a resistance to the prices. We can also spot changes in the polarity of the prices. On daily time, the stock has been taking strong resistance at 200 days SMA since November 2021. The RSI indicator is below 50 which shows bearish momentum. The stock may show some pullback. We recommend to hold this with a strict stop-loss of Rs 1,900 mark.  HDFC On weekly chart of HDFC, we saw some sideways action post breakdown happened at Rs 2,400 levels with volume confirmation. Prices have been maintaining lower low, lower high formation. The downtrend was also preceded by Negative direction. In the previous week, the stock opened gap down and managed to sustain below the gap. The relative strength index (RSI) indicator is below 50 mark on higher time frame which suggest bearish tone for the stock. We recommend trader and investors to stay away from HDFC till it sustains below Rs 2,400 mark. Rs 1,800 - 1,900 will act as a downside support for the counter. Level of Rs 2,400 would act as a strong resistance to the prices. "
1,"Hot Stocks | SRF, Deepak Nitrite, Infosys can give double-digit return in short term. Here's why",stocks," Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities For the last two trading sessions, the Nifty50 has been finding support around 15,190 levels. The Nifty has formed a double bottom at 15,190 odd levels and ended with 'Doji' candlestick pattern on the daily charts. Daily RSI from the Nifty has just turned up from the oversold zone. However, the primary trend of the index is bearish, as it has been trading below 20, 50, 100 and 200 daily moving averages (DMA). The Nifty has also been holding the lower top and lower bottom formations on the weekly charts. Nifty registered a fresh breakdown when it breached the 15,750 levels. In case of pullback, previous support of 15,750 is expected to interchange its role as resistance. One of the breadth indicators that we have been tracking is the number of stocks above their 200 DMA. Presently, 14 percent of the NSE500 stocks are trading above 200 DMA. This number has reached its lower band as we saw breadth bottoming out once the number reached 13-14 percent in history. During 2016 and 2018, the market bottomed out when the number of stocks above 200 DMA reached 14 percent. This indicator has acted as a trend reversal signal in history and the same should be closely tracked. Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we believe that pullbacks are part of bearish markets. If Nifty manages to hold above 15,190 levels, then there are good chances that it could show a pullback rally towards 15,700. However, considering the overall trend, rallies should be utilized to lighten long commitment. Below 15,190, Nifty could slide towards the next supports of 14,800 and 14,366 levels. Here is one buy call and two sell calls for next 2-3 weeks: SRF: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,135.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,242 | Target: Rs 1,985-1,910 | Return: 7-10 percent The stock has breached the crucial support of its 200 days exponential moving average (EMA) and closed below that for two consecutive sessions. Stock price has broken below from Bearish Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily charts. The monthly relative strength index (RSI) has exited the overbought zone with negative divergence. The stock is on the verge of breaking the consolidation which held for the last 6 months. Indicators and oscillators have turned bearish on daily and weekly charts. We recommend selling SRF in two tranches at current market price and second at Rs 2,200, for the target of Rs 1,985 and Rs 1,910, keeping a stop-loss at Rs 2,242.  Deepak Nitrite: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,754 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,841 | Targets: Rs 1,631-1,570 | Return: 7-10 percent The stock has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms on the daily charts. Stock is placed below its 20, 50, 100 and 200 daily moving average (DMA). It broke down below the bearish “Flag” pattern on the daily charts. Chemical companies have started underperforming the benchmark index. We recommend selling Deepak Nitrite in two tranches - one at current market price and second at Rs 1,810, for the targets of Rs 1,631 and Rs 1,570, keeping a stop-loss at Rs 1,841.  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,414 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,343 | Targets: Rs 1,513-1,590 | Return: 7-12 percent On June 20, 2022, the stock outperformed the benchmark index and crossed its 5 days EMA intraday. RSI has also been moving up with positive divergence on the daily chart. Nifty IT index looks extremely oversold on the short-term chart. A pullback rally can not be ruled out from current levels in Nifty IT Index. We recommend buying Infosys in two tranches - one at current market price and second at Rs 1,365, for the targets of Rs 1,513 and Rs 1,590, keeping stop-loss at Rs 1,343. "
2,"Mid-caps, small-caps in bear territory; more than 560 shares from each segment hit lower circuit, 52-week low",stocks," On June 20, the broader market seemed to be under severe selling pressure. This, when the benchmark indices showed a slight reversal, following a loss of over 7 percent in the previous six consecutive sessions. Stocks hitting the 52-week lows were galore. In fact, the broader space has already moved into bear market territory, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index having crashed 24 percent from the high (33,243) touched on October 19 last year, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index having tanked 34 percent till now, from the record high of 12,047 on January 18 this year. Generally, a fall of more than 20 percent from record high is considered bear market territory. The ongoing fall started on June 3. Since then, the Nifty50 has plunged nearly 8 percent, Nifty Midcap index fell 14.5 percent and Smallcap index tumbled 11.6 percent. And all this is thanks to inflation concerns, as a result of which central banks kicked off a swift rate hike cycle this year, which experts feel can cause recession at least in the developed markets. On a day when the benchmark indices were looking to bounce back, the market breadth was fully under the control of bears, with about seven shares declining for every share that climbed on the NSE, and on the BSE about five shares correcting for every advancing share. “Events of the last few days have increased the risk of recession in the US. Synchronised rate hikes by most central banks will certainly hit global growth this year. High interest rates and lower growth will impact corporate earnings. Risky assets are reacting to this pessimistic scenario,” VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, adding the 72 percent crash in the price of bitcoin is a reflection of the fear and risk aversion among investors. The only supporting factor in terms of money flow for the market, when there has been a consistent outflow from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), is the inflow from domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and retail investors since March last year. As a result of this “the correction in the Indian market is not as steep as in the US”, said Vijayakumar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 19 percent and S&P 500 lost nearly 24 percent from its record high hit in May and April last year respectively. FIIs have net sold more than Rs 2.67 lakh crore in the current year, and since October last year the outflow has been more than Rs 3.68 lakh crore. On the contrary, during the same period, DIIs have net bought Rs 2.8 lakh crore worth of shares. The recovery in benchmarks (if any) from oversold levels is likely to be temporary as the market will closely watch the Fed testimony scheduled this week, experts said. “This is finally a data-light week for India, and the US cash markets are also off for a holiday, and hence, the market is taking its time to build on the oversold conditions. Gains may be limited as Fed testimony scheduled this Wednesday will keep risk appetite under check,” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said. Investors lost big money Investors have lost Rs 3.5 lakh crore of wealth so far on Monday (at the time of writing this article) as the BSE market capitalisation fell to Rs 233.26 lakh crore, the lowest since July 2021, from Rs 236.77 lakh crore in the previous session. With this, there has been an erosion of Rs 25.7 lakh crore of investors' wealth since June 2, when the fall started in the market. Over 500 stocks at lower circuit The fall in the broader space was so severe that the number of shares hitting lower circuit as well as touching 52-week low crossed more than 560 shares each at the time of writing this article. The BSE data indicated that 572 shares hit lower circuit, against 138 stocks trading at the upper circuit, which included shares from 'B' Group and lower Group categories. Stocks on the lower circuit included Dhani Services, Vivimed Labs, De Nora, BL Kashyap, Megasoft, Mawan Sugars, Ugar Sugar, Tree House, FCS Software, Kavveri Telecom, Shah Alloys, Axiscades, SE Power, A2Z Infra, Rajshree Sugars, SPML Infra, Vikas Life, Parsvnath, Ankit Metal, MEP and Hindustan Motors. Further, 562 stocks were at 52-week lows on Monday, against 51 stocks at 52-week highs Of 562 stocks, nearly 200 stocks were from 'A' Group including Axis Bank, Aarti Industries, Aditya Birla Capital, Amara Raja Batteries, Astral, Aurobindo Pharma, Bank of India, Mrs Bectors Food, BEML, BHEL, Biocon, Birlasoft, Ceat, CESC, CSB Bank, Dalmia Bharat, Emami, Exide Industries, Gland Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Godrej Industries, Godrej Properties, HEG, Heranba Industries, Hindalco Industries, HPCL, Indiabulls Real Estate, India Cements, IndusInd Bank, InterGlobe Aviation, IOB, IOC, Jindal Steel & Power, LIC Housing Finance, LIC, Manappuram Finance, Motherson Sumi, NMDC, Punjab National Bank, RBL Bank, RITES, Rossari Biotech, SBI Card, Shree Cement, Symphony, Tata Steel, and Vedanta. Right time to invest Most experts feel this is the time to gradually accumulate quality large-caps as all indices have fallen in double-digits from their highs, indicating pricing in inflation concerns and recession (if any) risk. “In the present scenario, as market participants price in expectations of further rate hikes over this calendar year, equity valuations have started to fall back to historical averages. And over the next couple of quarters, as we see policy impact on curbing inflation, markets should start to consolidate, providing attractive entry levels for investors,” Vivek Goel, Joint MD at Tailwind Financial Services, said. Vijayakumar also advised that investors can use the weakness in the market to buy high-quality large-caps across sectors."

7,Buy Apollo Tyres; target of Rs 245: Emkay Global Financial,stocks," Emkay Global Financial's report on Apollo Tyres In its analyst meet, APTY management reiterated its revenue target of USD5bn in FY26, implying a 15% CAGR over FY22-26E vs. a 9% CAGR over FY18-22. Revenue growth will be driven by underlying industry growth, premiumization, and market share gains in India and Europe. Management maintained the ROCE (pre-tax) target at 12-15% by FY26E (7% in FY22), led by better asset turnover and margins. Future capacity expansions would be done mainly through debottlenecking and brownfield capacities. Margin expansion is expected to be driven by premiumization and cost-savings, such as reduction in material usage and digitization efforts. In the near term, cost pressures due to an increase in prices of crude derivatives and a lag in the pass-through of commodity inflation are likely to impact margins. We reduce FY23E/FY24E EPS by 8%/5% to Rs10.1/Rs17.9. Following the revision, we expect revenue/earnings CAGRs of 15%/33% over FY22-24E. Outlook The stock trades at 17x/10x P/E on FY23E/24E earnings. Near-term stock performance would depend on the movement of crude prices as derivatives form a major portion of RM costs (40%+). We retain our positive view on expectations of a cyclical upturn in the underlying automobile industry and improving free cash flows (avg. Rs13bn/year over FY23E/24E).

10,"Consumer durable stocks slide on falling demand, slowdown fears",stocks," India's consumer durable stocks have been trading lower over fears that higher cost of borrowing and product prices would hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with steep input prices. The BSE consumer durables index has fallen over 11 percent in the last 15 sessions, 12 of which ended in losses. Since the start of June, Amber Enterprises India has lost 21 percent, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail  16 percent, Titan Co Ltd  14 percent, Whirlpool Of India Ltd  13 percent, Dixon Technologies 13 percent, Havells India 12 percent, Blue Star 10 percent, Voltas 8.5 percent, Bajaj Electricals 7 percent, and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals 5 percent. Rising interest rates are a key overhang for the consumer durable sector coupled with higher commodity prices, analysts say. Higher interest rates could deter consumers who depend on unsecured loans for the purchase of such items, they say. Margin pressure, which was visible in the March quarter earnings, is expected to persist in the June and September quarters as well despite price hikes undertaken by these companies. Though raw material prices have cooled a bit in the past few weeks, a bigger correction is needed to sustain the margin, analysts say. The Reserve Bank of India has raised the policy repo rate by 90 basis points since May to stave off persistently high inflation which hit an 18-month high in April. ""Despite recent corrections, commodity prices still remain elevated. There is a fear of US recession which has impacted investor sentiment on all consumption items globally including India. “On the other hand, higher crude prices and currency depreciation has been adding cost inflation for all the manufacturers, impacting the bottom line of the companies directly"" Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, said. Recent reports of large price hikes by consumer firms to offset the surge in commodity inflation will likely reduce demand, experts say. ""The companies are examining the situation and will undertake calibrated price hikes to mitigate the inflationary pressure, which is expected to impact the overall demand in an already sluggish scenario"" said Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities. Chandan Taparia, Vice President, Equity Derivatives and Technical, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, expects the consumer durables index likely to correct 5-7 percent more, given the recent price pattern and weak chart setup. ""Inflation has peaked and demand-pull back will cause inflation to soften. However, with the expectation of good monsoon and consequent rural recovery, we expect consumer demand to pick up with a quarter's lag"", Bolinjkar said."

12,"JP Morgan feels LIC’s valuation is 'unduly harsh', market thinks otherwise",stocks," JP Morgan India, one of the 10 book-running lead managers of Life Insurance Corporation of India’s record-breaking initial public offering, feels that the market’s treatment of the country’s largest life insurer has been unfair. The shares of LIC fell to their fresh 52-week low of Rs 650 on the National Stock Exchange on June 20 as the investment banker’s research wing initiated coverage on the stock with an “outperform” rating and a price target of Rs 840 a share. Shares of the life insurer have tanked more than 30 percent since its listing on May 17, driven by concerns over its growth, perceived volatility in its embedded value and concerns over competition from private sector players. “LIC’s new business value is only 1 percent of its policies in force. Therefore, with 99 percent of value from old policies, we see the 0.75 times P/EV (price-to-embedded value) as unduly harsh, even assuming no growth,” JP Morgan India’s research wing said in a note. The brokerage firm said that LIC has picked up growth recently and expects the same to trend at 6 percent on an annualised basis over the current and next two financial years. “The improved ability of agents post re-opening should drive growth. In the last four months, LIC’s retail premium is growing faster than industry (+32% y/y) and is above 2019 level,” JP Morgan said. The brokerage firm is of the view that higher consistency in disclosure of embedded value going ahead could help trigger re-rating in the stock. “In our view, LIC would need to show consistency in EV which would signal accuracy on assumptions used,” the brokerage house said. The stock listed on the bourses at Rs 865 against the issue price of Rs 949. The government raised nearly Rs 21,000 crore by selling around a 3 percent stake in the life insurer through India’s biggest IPO, which is now being counted in the ranks of the world’s biggest let-downs as far as public issues go. Brokerages such as Macquarie Securities India and Emkay Global Financial Services, on the other side, have remained neutral on the life insurer despite meaningful correction in the stock price since their initiation of coverage and represent the scepticism around the company’s prospects. Macquarie initiated coverage on the stock in May with a “neutral” rating, saying that the ability to sell high-margin non-par products—as opposed to par products that provide policyholders a significant share of policyholder’s surplus— will require a change in the mindset of the organization and its agency force, “which could be LIC’s biggest challenge in our view”. LIC’s shares are currently trading 34 percent below Macquarie’s price target for the stock of Rs 1,000 per share. ‘Elephant that can’t dance’ Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial initiated coverage with a “neutral” rating, arguing that LIC was an “elephant that can’t dance”. “LIC’s valuation on price-to-embedded value appears cheaper when compared with listed private players; this is justified by the fact that LIC adds merely 1.0-1.5 percent of EV each year from VNB, as against around 8-11 percent in the case of private life insurers,” Emkay Global said in a note in early June. While all three brokerages which have initiated coverage on the stock agree that LIC’s fair value lies close to one time its one-year forward embedded value even though their estimates for embedded value differ, market participants remain far away from that valuation. As per JP Morgan, investors are valuing the stock at merely 0.75 times its estimate price-to-embedded value. At 12.05 am, shares of LIC managed to recoup all of their losses and rise 0.6 percent to Rs 658.50 on the NSE but still lacked the enthusiasm portrayed by its former investment banker."

Rising bets of a recession in the US and the European Union over the next 12 months along with slowing demand in China has forced traders to pare their optimism for the commodity despite persistent supply-side issues. “With rapidly slowing growth momentum and a Fed committed to restoring price stability, we believe a mild recession starting in Q4 2022 is now more likely than not,” investment bank Nomura said in a note on June 19. That said, global crude oil is still up 42 percent this year given concerns that supply will remain tight due to sanctions imposed by the West on Russian oil. Rising oil prices had been one of the driving forces behind the outperformance by ONGC and Oil India in 2022 so far. While shares of Oil India are still higher by 18 percent for the year, those of ONGC are now down 5.5 percent after the recent correction. Fuelling concerns over these stocks is the likely imposition of a windfall tax on the firms' earnings to compensate for the cuts in excise duty taken by the government to provide relief to consumers. Brokerages, however, still remain optimistic that crude oil prices will sustain above the $100 per barrel mark for the remainder of 2022-23 in effect providing a boost to earnings of ONGC and Oil India. Further, domestic natural gas prices are expected to be hiked sharply at the upcoming September review that could further boost earnings for ONGC and Oil India.

17,Top 10 trading ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks as market breaks 52-week low,stocks," The market went fully under the reign of bears and kept going down for the second week in a row. The benchmark indices hit a fresh 52-week low in the week ended June 17 as fears of a recession intensified after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 bps in its June policy meeting and hinted another 50-75 bps hike in rates in the next policy meeting to control inflation. The Nifty50 fell more than 900 points or 5.6 percent during the week to close at 15,293.5, the lowest closing level since May 25, 2021, taking two-week losses to nearly 8 percent and the correction of nearly 18 percent from record highs. All sectoral indices fell sharply and closed in the red. The elevated volatility clearly favoured bears and the price trend also indicated nervousness on the street, but the sentiments indicator like Stochastic showed positive crossover, generally indicates a bit of possibility of recovery from lows. Hence, if the index shows any recovery then there could be resistance around 15,400-15,500 area, whereas it could get support around 15,200-15,000 levels, and breaking of which could create some panic in the market, experts said. ""Taking a glance at the weekly time frame chart, we can see prices sliding below '89-EMA' for the first time after July 2020. So, pricewise, it needs to be construed as a breakdown, does not augur well for the bulls. On the flipside, the Nifty is exactly placed at the previous breakout point of May 2021 which is around 15,400 – 15,300,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said. In addition, he said the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator on the daily chart is showing a ‘positive divergence’ i.e. lower lows in recent prices and higher lows in the oscillator. This condition generally happens at the fag-end of any downtrend. Hence, looking at the charts, we are clearly in two minds at this juncture, the market expert feels. As far as supports are concerned, 15,200–15,000 are to be seen as immediate supports and breach of the same, would certainly create some panic kind of situation in markets, Chavan said, adding on the flipside that the markets would regain the strength only after surpassing the key levels of 15,700–15,800 on a closing basis. Till then, it’s not advisable to carry aggressive longs overnight. Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the June 17 closing prices: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 997.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 980 | Target: Rs 1,040-1,058 | Return: 4-6 percent Over the past month, the stock has managed to surpass the all-time high of Rs 993. The stock is in throwback mode after hitting Rs 1,058 level, which usually happens to complete the pattern. The stock was down in the first half of the trading session on Friday, although it came back to Rs 997 in the second half, which is positive in the short term. Depending on the formation, the stock could rebound towards Rs 1,040 or Rs 1,058 levels. However, we need to place a stop-loss at Rs 980 to protect the trading position in it.  Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 399 | Target: Rs 450-490 | Return: 4-13 percent Since the last month, the stock is relatively outperforming the index and on Friday it has made a strong comeback from the lower boundary of the trading range. The stock is still in the trading range between Rs 400 and Rs 450. Until the stock is not crossing the level of Rs 450, it would remain rangebound, however, while looking at the volume expansion, we could see the stock is climbing to Rs 450 level. On the dismissal of the trading range on the upward side, the stock can gradually move to Rs 490-500 levels. The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and balance 50 percent to buy around Rs 410 levels. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 399. On the higher side. the targets would be Rs 450 and Rs 490.  Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities Indus Towers: Buy | LTP: Rs 208 | Stop-Loss: Rs 193 | Target: Rs 237 | Return: 14 percent trendline breakout, signaling strength in the stock. On June 17, 2022, the stock rose to one-month high and outperformed the benchmark-Nifty. Spike in volume and rise in future open interest indicates that major market participants are in favour of the bulls, as risk reward is quite favorable for fresh long position at this juncture. This could lead the stock towards Rs 226 initially and Rs 237 subsequently. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around Rs 197-193 zone.  Delta Corp: Buy | LTP: Rs 184.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 162 | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 30 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior mega up-move (Rs 54-340), which was placed at Rs 163 and poised for a fresh up-move.

Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 404 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 15.5 percent After a rising channel breakdown, the stock tested its medium-term support zone and poised for an up-move. Since late-May 2022, the stock formed multiple bullish trend reversal patterns around that zone on weekly chart. Its daily technical indicators reversed from the lower levels and are positively poised. The stock has potential to move towards Rs 480 initially and Rs 500 subsequently.
