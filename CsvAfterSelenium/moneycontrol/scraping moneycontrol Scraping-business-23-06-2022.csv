0,NCDRC says construction of additional tower by M3M Group ‘illegal’; directs builder not to proceed with its construction,business," The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) on June 23 termed the construction of an additional tower by Gurgaon-based M3M Group as ‘illegal’ and the act of not taking consent of buyers for the purpose of raising new construction as ‘a clear deficiency of service' and directed the builder not to proceed with its construction. The application was filed by 300 buyers of the project M3M Merlin located in Sector 67 in August 2020. “…going for a new tower is a clear deficiency of service in terms of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and Haryana Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. It is another matter that if the builder had obtained the consent and then applied for change in the site plan along with permission for a new tower, it would have been in order as per the statutory provision. Having not obtained this consent, we take the construction as violation of the aforementioned statutes. In view of the aforesaid discussions, we deem the construction of Tower 11 as illegal and direct the Opposite Parties 1 and 2 not to proceed with its construction,” the order said. The consumer complaint was filed under Section 58 read with Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 by homebuyer Ajay Kumar Verma and others against M3M India Private Limited and Others seeking certain relief and compensation, on the ground of alleged deficiency on the part of the builder and other parties. Also Read: Supreme Court upholds NCDRC order directing NCR-based builder to refund Rs 1.9 crore to homebuyer The buyers stated in their application that while the project was supposed to consist of 10 residential towers, the builder proposed construction of a new tower, i.e. 11th tower, with no prior intimation or consent of the existing buyers. They said that it was only in April-May, 2019 that it came to their knowledge that the builder was planning to construct a new tower without seeking their prior consent. The complaint also noted that the buyers took possession of their units from 2017 onwards and it was only after five-six months of taking possession that the defects and deficiencies started coming to their knowledge. However, till date none of the defects have been cured, the application said. The buyers had prayed that the builder should not be permitted to construct the 11th tower in the project until consent is taken from all the apartment owners of the project M3M Merlin. Also Read: A homebuyer not an investor despite owning multiple properties with same builder, is entitled to refund: NCDRC “In our considered opinion, obtaining the consent of flat owners becomes essential when a new tower is being constructed and which is in deviation to the certain approval, site plan, number of towers, Occupation Certificate, etc. initially promised to the allottees and as per Haryana Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. The submission of the learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties that the consent was already taken from the flat owners in the Builder Buyer Agreement and the Deed of Declaration is disingenuous without a basis. “We do agree that certain caveats and provisions were mentioned in these two documents. Nowhere there is clarity that the builder is proposing construction of a tower in the area earmarked for future development. So the rightful process should have been adopted by the builder to obtain the consent of the flat owners and then proceed ahead with obtaining the approval of the DTCP for change of layout and construction of a new tower. We do not see any evidence of any effort taken by the Opposite Parties 1 and 2 to connect with the flat owners or sending any communication to them with regard to their plan for construction of a new tower,” the order said. “…there is a major deficiency of service on the part of the Opposite Parties for having promised to the prospective flat buyers in the form of the brochure that a certain kind of Project is being conceived, which will have only 10 towers and a low-rise EWS building on one side. Having gotten applications from the flat buyers and having accepted booking amounts, the developer has been changing the plan one at a time in deviation to the original Project. The first change is that of the shift of EWS housing area and next the construction of a new Tower. It is admitted that the flat buyers have not objected to change in 2014 for shifting of EWS area. But the area for future development does not necessarily mean construction of new high-rise tower. ""The same story continued with the Occupation Certificate, Deed of Declaration and Builder Buyer Agreement in 2017 keeping area for future development as vague as possible and without any inkling of construction of a new Tower,” the order said. Piyush Singh, advocate, who represented the 300 homebuyers of Merlin, said that this is a massive victory for homebuyers residing in completed projects since in this case the residents were facing harassment of illegal construction within the common area, which is not only a safety hazard but also decreases the super area of the project. The order also provides relief on the issue of IFMS, excess EDC/IDC collected and poor quality of construction. “This judgment will reinforce confidence among buyers that they do have a legal remedy against a developer even if a project is complete and registry is done,” he added. “Suo-moto cognisance should also be taken by the authorities and investigations be launched, as to how permission of such an illegal tower was given without due compliances and strict penalty should be imposed on the builder,” said Aditya Parolia, advocate, PSP Legal. An M3M spokesperson said that while the company has “high regard for NCDRC, we believe that the facts have been falsely presented against M3M by the complainants. We now propose to take this matter further for justice.” The buyers, in their application, had also said that the builder should be directed to obtain the necessary permissions from concerned authorities to acquire the revenue road for the project to be complete in all respects, within six months from the date of filing of their complaint and if the same was not done, the builder should be directed to pay Rs 5 lakh to each of the owners as compensation towards the devaluation of property and threat to life and security on account of revenue road. The homeowners had also prayed that the builder should be directed to refund the excess EDCIIDC charges collected from all the apartment owners of the project with interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum from the date of receipt of such payment towards EDC/IDC charges.

The NCDRC order said that the issue of RWA needs to be pursued by the buyers as per the statutory provisions in the appropriate forum. As for the defects in construction of the apartments and towers in the project, M3M India Private Limited and Consolidate Realtors Private Limited have been directed to appoint statutory approved architect and engineer within 15 days, who will then submit a report within one month on the actual position on ground with respect to what was proposed in the agreement and they would have to carry out such changes/ rectification as recommended within four months of receipt of this report. On the issue of EDC/IDC, they have been directed to get the account of receipt and expenditure vetted by a chartered accountant within one month and return the excess fund, if any collected, from the flat owners.

1,The Bureau of Indian Standards issues performance standards for electric vehicle batteries,business," The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has come out with performance standards for electric vehicle batteries in order to ensure the safety of consumers, a senior consumer affairs ministry official said on Thursday. BIS, the national standards-setting body that functions under the consumer affairs ministry, has published the ""performance standards for electronic vehicle batteries"", the official said. The standard ""IS 17855: 2022"" has been formulated for lithium-ion traction battery packs and systems of electrically-propelled road vehicles and it has been harmonized with ISO 12405-4: 2018, the official added. According to the official, the new EV batteries' standard incorporates the test procedure for the basic characteristic of performance, reliability and electrical functionality for the battery packs and system for either high power or high energy application. This standard is formulated considering real-life scenarios for an electric vehicle such as vehicle in parking (battery is not used for an extended period of time), the battery system is being shipped (stored), operating battery at low and high temperature etc., accordingly various tests are incorporated in this standard. Electric vehicles operate on an electric motor and rechargeable batteries. Over the past decade, electric vehicles have grown in terms of visibility and availability in the market. Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries because of their high power-to-weight ratio."
2,India's Russian oil imports jump 50 times; now accounts for 10% of all import: official,business," India's crude oil imports from Russia have jumped over 50 times since April and now make up for 10 per cent of all crude bought from overseas, a senior government official said on Thursday. Russian oil made up for just 0.2 per cent of all oil imported by India prior to the Ukraine war. ""Russia oil now makes up 10 per cent of India's oil import basket in April. It is now among the top 10 suppliers,"" the official told reporters here. As much as 40 per cent of the Russian oil has been bought by private refiners – Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy. Last month, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia to become India's second-biggest supplier of oil behind Iraq as refiners snapped up Russian crude available at a deep discount following the war in Ukraine. Indian refiners bought about 25 million barrels of Russian oil in May. Russian-origin crude accounted for 10 per cent of India's total seaborne imports in April for the first time, rising from 0.2 per cent throughout 2021 and Q1 2022. India, the world's third-biggest oil-importing and consuming nation, has long defended purchases of crude oil from Russia following President Vladimir Putin ordering the invasion of Ukraine. The Oil Ministry had last month stated that ""energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption."" Iraq remained the top supplier to India in May and Saudi Arabia is now the third biggest supplier. India has taken advantage of discounted prices to ramp up oil imports from Russia at a time when global energy prices have been rising. After the US and China, India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil, over 85 per cent of which is imported. Following its invasion of Ukraine, there are now fewer buyers for Russia's Ural crude oil, with some foreign governments and companies deciding to shun Russian energy exports, and its price has fallen. Indian refiners have taken advantage of this and bought Russian crude oil at discount as high as USD 30 per barrel. Earlier, the crude was disadvantageous because of the high freight cost."

4,Dhruva Space to test satellite deployer onboard ISRO PLSV-C53 on June 30,business," Hyderabad-based space tech startup Dhruva Space Private Limited will be testing its satellite deployer which would be onboard an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launch vehicle (rocket) slated to launch on June 30. The startup will be testing its CubeSats satellite orbital deployer, which would be on board ISRO’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle C 53 (PSLV C53). PSLV-C53 is the second commercial mission of NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a public sector undertaking of the Indian government and commercial arm of ISRO. Satellite orbital deployers are the mechanical casings in which CubeSats, nano satellites with the dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, sit when a launch takes place. Through the test, Dhruva intends to space qualify its satellite orbital deployer. “When an asset is space-qualified, it means that an asset meets the design and technical requirement for it to operate in the space environment,” a Dhruva Space Private Limited spokesperson explained. To ensure a smooth launch and stable deployment, Dhruva Space said that it has indigenously developed the systems for the orbital deployer keeping in mind that it has to be compatible with the PSLV. It would also be conducting in-orbit experiments using the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM). In March, Dhruva Space had signed an agreement with NewSpace India Limited regarding this. Speaking ahead of the PSLV C53 mission, Sanjay Nekkanti, CEO, Dhruva Space Private Limited, said, “The mission will demonstrate the in-house developed CubeSat Deployers ahead of the launch of our Satellite Missions, Thybolt-1 and Thybolt-2, onboard the PSLV C54 Mission.” The PSLV C53 mission follows the June 10 inauguration on IN-SPACe, an independent nodal agency under the Department of Space. The entity permits, regulates, promotes, hand-holds, monitors, and supervises space activities of Non-Governmental Private Entities (NGEs) in India."

8,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Financial innovation: RBI walks a tight rope,business," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. What’s fintech? It’s subprime lending on an app — that’s American investment manager Jim Chanos, who perhaps made the remark not entirely in jest. Financial innovation is under fire, in India and other parts of the world as well. Locally, fintech companies are scrambling to make sense of a Reserve Bank of India circular that said loading credit lines into prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as wallets and prepaid cards is not permitted. Now PPIs can be loaded with cash, a debit from your bank account, a debit card and even a credit card. On the face of it, one is tempted to ask what’s the big deal – if you can load a PPI using a credit card, why not a credit line provided by a regulated lender? But it seems that the regulator is worried about financial stability and unregulated lending. In a regular credit card, KYC (know your customer) norms are handled by the card issuing bank. In the new business models, KYC is done by the fintech company while the credit line is provided by a bank, or more often, by a non-bank finance company. There is some confusion since the RBI circular said the norms applied to non-bank PPIs. However, there are cases, where a bank-issued PPI (eg. Slice card) are backed by a credit line from an NBFC. RBI, of course, is not comfortable with NBFCs getting into the credit card business. Nor does it seem to have much confidence in the underwriting models employed by fintech companies. Moreover, there are also murmurs that some of the fintechs which are lending aggressively do not report transactions to credit bureaus, all of which can lead to instability building in the system without anyone realising it. If that is the case, the whole Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) gig would become a case for scrutiny. It is one of the fastest growing sectors in the fintech industry. Credit is also seen as a key avenue for profitability among fintech companies since very few make money from payments. While these are early days yet, data from TransUnion Cibil show that BNPL users have higher delinquency rates on credit products compared to users of other forms of unsecured credit such as personal loans, consumer durable loans and so on. The regulator has to walk a tight rope. On one hand, it doesn’t want to stifle innovation. Quite often, products such as BNPL bring new customers into the formal financial system and help them set up a credit history. As Kotak Institutional Equities points out, such innovation then helps banks build scale where they let off, since they have access to low cost funds. The brokerage cites the examples of housing finance to self-employed, commercial vehicle finance and so on, where traditional NBFCs offered new products before banks built scale. On the other hand, there is the question of financial instability, something which no regulator can take lightly. It is not an easy task and Governor Shaktikanta Das said as much in a recent speech: “Large scale use of new methodologies in credit risk assessment can create systemic concerns like over-leverage, inadequate credit assessment, etc. Authorities and regulators have to strike a fine balance between enabling innovation and preventing systemic risks.” In the same speech, the governor also talked about decentralised finance (DeFi) and the unique challenges it posed to regulators. Perhaps, he need not worry so much, at least on this count. The goal of DeFi is to get rid of third parties involved in financial transactions and do away with a centralised governance body. The cryptocurrency crash has exposed the hollowness of such claims as several “Crypto networks that pledged to put users in control have put themselves in charge”, says this article from the FT.

9,Agricultural Minister to take up industry's demand on reducing GST on pesticides with Finance Ministry,business," Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday assured the agro-chemicals industry that he would take up the industry's demand to reduce GST on pesticides to 5 per cent from 18 per cent with the finance minister. Addressing the 11th Agrochemicals Conference 2022' organised by FICCI, the minister stressed on the need for crop diversification and said farmers should grow more horticulture and costly crops. On the industry's demand to reduce GST on pesticides, Tomar said the matter related to this subject is being dealt by the GST Council. ""I will meet and apprise the Finance Minister about your demand,"" he said. Tomar said he would take up the issue with the finance ministry on behalf of the industry but a final decision on this would be taken by the GST Council. The minister was responding to the demand made by FICCI Crop Protection Committee Chairman R G Agarwal that the GST should be reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, as it is in the case of fertilisers. This will bring down the cost and promote usage of crop-protection chemicals. Tomar also emphasised on making agriculture profitable by increasing production and crop productivity, besides reducing input cost as well as post-harvest crop losses. He highlighted that the Centre has launched many programmes in the last eight years to boost agriculture sector and double farmers income. Tomar said the Centre, along with States, is making efforts to provide new technologies to farmers. The government is in the process to set up 10,000 FPOs (farmers producer organisations) to improve income of farming community, he added. The minister said the country is self-sufficient in foodgrains production while the government is making efforts to boost oilseeds and pulese output in a mission mode. He spoke about the need to undertake research in agriculture sector in the field of new seed varieties to improve crop yield. Talking about fertilisers and pesticides, Tomar said there is a need to promote balanced use of these crop protection products. He agreed that there is no unjudicious use of fertilisers and pesticides in India but asked the industry to work on alternative products as farmers are also taking interest in organic as well as natural farming. Tomar said the government and the industry should work together to create awareness among the small and marginal farmers about benefits of agro-chemicals. The minister said Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) are working in this direction but there is a need to make concerted efforts."

12,RBI issues IT outsourcing framework for regulated entities,business," The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 23 issued a broader framework for financial services entities to address technology-related risks. The framework was issued in the backdrop of rising instances of technical glitches, fraud, and irregularities in the IT systems of banks. “Regulated Entities (REs) have been extensively leveraging Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) in their business, products, and services with increasing dependence on third parties,” the central bank said. “Such reliance on IT/ITeS provided by third parties exposes the REs to various risks.” In February, the RBI had said that it will release draft guidelines on the risk management framework for outsourcing IT Services, managing related concentration risk, its periodic risk assessment, and aspects of outsourcing of IT Services to foreign service providers. The provisions of these directions are applied to all scheduled commercial banks, excluding regional rural Banks, local area banks, and small finance banks. They are also applicable to payments banks, primary (urban) co-operative banks having asset size of Rs 1,000 crore and above, and non-banking financial companies in the top, upper and middle layers. They are also applicable to credit information companies and All India Financial Institutions like National Housing Bank, NABARD, and SIDBI, among others. Outsourcing of IT Services mainly covers IT infrastructure management, maintenance and support, Network and security solutions maintenance, application development, maintenance and testing, cloud computing services among others, the regulator said. Regulated entities desirous of outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services shall not require prior approval from the RBI. However, such arrangements shall be subject to on-site or off-site monitoring and inspection/ scrutiny by the supervising authority, the RBI said. These entities shall evaluate the need for outsourcing of IT Services based on comprehensive assessment of attendant benefits, risks and availability of commensurate processes to manage those risks. In this process, such entities shall consider important aspects, such as determining need for outsourcing based on criticality of activity to be outsourced, determining expectations or outcome from outsourcing, determining success factors and cost-benefit analysis and deciding the model for outsourcing. Further, the regulated entities shall ensure that in the outsourcing of IT Services engagement, wherein such outsourcing services support their financial services, the applicable directions issued by RBI on managing risks and the code of conduct in outsourcing of financial services are adhered to. Entities are also required to take steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in performing the services as would have been employed by it if the same activity was not outsourced, the banking regulator said. Accordingly, the entities shall not engage an IT service provider that would result in reputation of regulated entity being compromised or weakened. The RBI said that the regulated entities shall establish an inventory of services provided by the service providers, including key entities involved in their supply chains, map their dependency on third parties and periodically evaluate the information received from the service providers. They are also required to ensure that the service provider shall neither impede nor interfere with the ability of the regulated entities to effectively oversee and manage its activities nor impede the supervising authority in carrying out the supervisory functions and objectives, the central bank said. The service provider, if not a group company, is not be owned or controlled by any director, or key managerial personnel, or approver of the outsourcing arrangement of the regulated entity, or their relatives. The entities are also expected to have a robust grievance redressal mechanism, which in no way shall be compromised on account of outsourcing, the regulator said. The entity intending to outsource any of its IT activities is expected put in place a comprehensive board approved IT outsourcing policy. The policy shall incorporate role and responsibilities of the Board, Board Committee and Senior Management, IT function, business function, and oversight & assurance functions in respect of outsourcing of IT services, said the RBI. The outsourcing of IT Services policy shall contain a clear exit strategy with regard to outsourced IT activities/ IT enabled services, while ensuring business continuity during and after exit, the RBI said. “The strategy should include exit strategy for different scenarios of exit or termination of services (e.g., change of service provider ownership, liquidation, merger/ acquisition, undesirable changes due to change in regulatory requirements affecting the service provider, security breach, regulatory action on the service provider, etc.) with stipulation of minimum period to execute such plans, as necessary,’ the directive said."
13,HDFC Life introduces ‘Cardiac Risk Assessment at Home’ service to ease medicals,business," HDFC Life,  one of India’s leading life insurers, on June 23 announced the launch of the 'Cardiac Risk Assessment' service, which promises convenience to individuals who have to undergo medical while applying for an HDFC Life insurance policy. Usually, based on their health conditions, some applicants are required to undergo medicals, including a stress test to evaluate cardiac health. ""While tests like blood tests, ECG, etc can be done at home, customers need to visit a medical centre (empanelled with the life insurer) for the stress test. This requirement often causes a delay in the issuance of policies by the life insurance company,"" the company said. The process for the test is as follows- An applicant needs to make an appointment, after which an HDFC Life representative will visit the person’s house with adequate equipment including a Cardiotrack portable ECG.

15,Axis MF front running case | Sacked fund manager Viresh Joshi sues MF house alleging wrongful termination,business," Viresh Joshi, a former fund manager and chief trader of Axis Mutual Fund, has filed a lawsuit accusing the asset management company of unfairly terminating his employment in connection with a suspected front-running case. Axis Asset Management Co. Ltd. (Axis AMC), India’s seventh largest mutual fund house with assets worth Rs 2.43 trillion, sacked Joshi on May 18 in the case in which Joshi and his former colleague and assistant fund manager Deepak Agarwal are under investigation. The fund house also sacked Agarwal on May 20. Axis AMC had first suspended Joshi on May 3 before letting him go. The lawsuit follows a legal notice Joshi’s lawyers sent to the fund house on May 20, seeking a detailed explanation as to why he had been sacked pending completion of the investigation into the alleged front-running case. The fund house has so far not publicly disclosed the exact nature of wrongdoings that it has been investigating, but has maintained that there have been alleged violations of securities law. The case came to light in early May when the fund house implemented changes in its equity fund management. At the time, Axis AMC didn’t comment on the reasons behind the changes. However, in a communication sent to investors and distributors on May 9, Chandresh Nigam, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis AMC, said the fund house had started an investigation and appointed “reputed external advisors” to carry out the investigation. Front-running Joshi has sued Axis Asset Management for ​alleged wrongful termination as well as mental trauma and sought damages to the tune of Rs 54 crore. Joshi, who has been in the capital market since around 20 years, has been with Axis AMC since 2009. Prior to working at Axis AMC, he has worked at BNP Paribas Securities and ICICI Securities. His lawyers, Mansukhlal, Hiralal & Co. Advocates and Solicitors, filed suit on June 23, in the Bombay High Court. ""The termination letter that Axis AMC sent to my client, Joshi, is invalid,"" says Purvi Asher, Partner, Mansukhlal Hiralal & Co., Advocates & Solicitors. In front-running, a dealer with an institutional money manager like a mutual fund takes advantage of his knowledge of the orders that his employer has lined up for the day and tries to profit from them. If the dealer wants to profit, he enters the market minutes before he punches in the orders by the fund house. Mutual funds usually place large orders on the stock market that can move the price of a stock. The dealer buys or sells the stock minutes before the mutual fund places its trades. The idea is to profit from the big investor’s moves, either by buying or selling shares. The probe Axis AMC appointed law firm AZB & Partners and management consultants Alvarez & Marsal to conduct an investigation into the front-running allegations. Last month, the fund house also brought in audit and consulting firm Deloitte to co-conduct this investigation. Nigam said in the same letter that the investigation started in February 2022. It has been close to around four months -- and a month after Joshi was sacked -- but the investigation is still underway, one of Joshi’s contentions in his lawsuit. Moneycontrol sent a detailed list of questions to Axis AMC on the evening of June 14, one of which was why the investigation has taken so long and by when the fund house expects the probe to be completed. In its reply, the fund house said: “Any internal investigation (including the existing suo moto investigation) is iterative in nature, involves following detailed processes, has inherent limitations (since some data is not publicly available) and evolves over a period of time, based inter alia on ongoing findings. We are working and co-operating with regulatory authorities.” To a question why Joshi had been sacked before the investigation was completed, the fund house said: “In relation to Mr. Joshi, we have more than adequate findings concerning breaches of our policies, including non-cooperation with our internal investigation (during his suspension period). We also have strong reasons to believe that he has violated securities law.” The fund house did not elaborate on these allegations. To be sure, front-running is just one of the many, and not the only, aspects of the securities law. Five reasons for the sacking In a detailed termination letter Axis AMC sent to Joshi on May 18, the fund hose spelled out five reasons why it had sacked him. One, Joshi did not cooperate with the investigation and did not provide the information the probe agencies sought from him. Two, Joshi’s assets were disproportionate to his legal income and he did not provide the sources of the “disproportionate assets” to prove that they had not been acquired through illegal activities “as a dealer and fund manager of the company.” Three, Joshi repeatedly gave false statements to the investigating team, orally and in writing as well. Four, Joshi failed to disclose an email (on his official and personal email ID) that someone sent him in January alleging he was engaged in front– running. Further, he did not disclose that he had a personal email id, to the investigation team, contrary to an undertaking he had given to Axis MF in February 2022. Five, Joshi failed to give contents of the above-mentioned personal email account to the investigating team, despite being asked to do so, and he also deleted contents of one of the above email accounts. The letter also accused Joshi of violating securities laws. The termination letter did not mention specific allegations or front-running. Moneycontrol has a copy of this detailed termination letter. Lawsuit claims In his lawsuit, Joshi has claimed that contrary to Axis AMC’s claim that it had received a tip-off from an external source alerting it to the alleged front-running activity, it was he who had first told his seniors about increased activity in the shares he had been trading on behalf of the fund house. He claims that he had begun to alert the fund house in around June 2021. Between November 2021 and ​January 2022, trading activity in the shares he dealt with on behalf of the fund house, spiked, he added in his lawsuit. This, he claims, led to the fund house starting an investigation. Sometime in February 2022, Nigam called the entire equity fund management team to Axis AMC ‘s boardroom at its Mumbai headquarters and announced the start of the investigation and that it was crucial everyone must cooperate. Axis AMC has strongly denied Joshi’s claims of being a whistle-blower. In its reply to Moneycontrol’s questionnaire it said: “Any depiction of Mr. Joshi including in your queries, as a whistle-blower is wholly baseless. Specifically, any statement that refers to Mr. Joshi highlighting any specific compliance concerns with our management or our compliance team is factually incorrect, and is denied.” The portion on “compliance concerns” Axis AMC referred to were Joshi’s claims that he had alerted his seniors to suspicious trading activity in stocks he traded on the fund house’s behalf. ‘Internal findings’ In an interview to CNBC in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meetings, Axis Bank MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said there had been no whistleblower complaint that triggered the investigation. Both Chaudhry and the fund house have maintained that an internal finding led to the start of the probe. Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify either Joshi’s or Axis MF’s claims about what prompted the probe as the investigation is still underway. Joshi also claims in his lawsuit that in raids conducted by the fund house at his house, his personal laptops, phones and tablets as well as devices belonging to his daughter and father were taken away. Multiple rounds of grilling Joshi said he had made himself available for multiple rounds of questioning first by the investigating firms and then later by the capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The only time he was unavailable was when he was attending to his father-in-law, who had been admitted in hospital for surgery, he claimed in his lawsuit. Axis MF’s claims about him being unavailable for questioning pertained to the period between May 3, when he was suspended, and May 18, when his employment was terminated. Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify Joshi’s whereabouts during this period, although his father-in-law’s medical records and hospitalisation proof (including his admission and discharge details) during the period are part of Joshi’s legal filings in the Bombay High Court. Nor could Moneycontrol independently verify the veracity of Joshi’s responses to the investigations, one of the main charges behind his sacking. Due process followed Axis AMC said to Moneycontrol that “post the suo moto investigation which started in February 2022, we (i.e. the AMC) had reason to act upon the interim findings, after diligently following due process.” A email send to AZB didn’t elicit a response."
16,What is the EU gas crisis? Here's all you need to know,business," Amid reduced flows of Russian gas supply, European nations are left scrambling for alternative choices buoyed by inflationary pressures and supply chain disturbances. Gas prices have hit record levels in Europe, adding to challenges for policymakers trying to haul Europe back from an economic slowdown. Also Read: What are Europe's options in case of Russian gas disruption? EU relied on Russia for 40 percent of its gas needs before war: The European Union (EU) relied on Russia for as much as 40 percent of its gas needs before the Russia-Ukraine war — rising to 55 percent for Germany, leaving a huge gap to fill in an already tight global gas market. According to experts, coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel in terms of emissions, yet the most important target for replacement to alternative energy sources, reported Reuters. Coal as an alternative choice: The energy disruption has prompted some European governments to reconsider coal, one of the dirtiest and most polluting ways of producing energy. Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands have indicated that coal-fired plants could be used to compensate for a cut in Russian gas supplies. Reports suggest that the energy crisis could see Europe delay its transition away from fossil fuels, although policymakers insist the burning of coal is a necessary stopgap to help prevent a winter supply shortage. Also Read: Russia crimps gas flows just as Europe races to stock up for winter Nord Stream 1 operating at 40 per cent capacity: Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has cut capacity through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that runs to Germany under the Baltic Sea, citing the delayed return of equipment serviced by Germany’s Siemens Energy in Canada. However, Russian gas is still being pumped via Ukraine, but at a reduced rate. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic, a vital supply route to Germany, is working at just 40 percent capacity. Also Read: As Russia cuts gas, German industry grapples with painful choices Germany risks recession; enters Phase 2 of 3-stage emergency gas plan: Germany faces certain recession if faltering Russian gas supplies stop completely, an industry body warned earlier in the week, and Italy said it would consider offering financial backing to help companies refill gas storage to avoid a deeper crisis in winter. Germany has entered Phase 2 of its three-stage emergency gas plan on Thursday due to reduced supply from Russia and high prices, but is not yet triggering a clause that lets utilities pass on soaring gas costs to customers, reported Reuters. The Phase 2 ""alarm stage"" kicks in when the government sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages of gas. Facing dwindling gas flows from main supplier Russia, Europe's largest economy had been at Phase 1 of its emergency plan since end-March. It faces the unprecedented prospect of businesses and consumers running out of energy. Meanwhile, Germany has also warned that Russia’s moves to slash Europe’s natural gas supplies risked sparking a collapse in energy markets, drawing a parallel to the role of Lehman Brothers in triggering the financial crisis, reported Bloomberg news. Also Read: What LNG can and can’t do to replace Europe’s imports of Russian gas Europe lacks infrastructure to meet LNG storage needs: To add to the pressure, soaring European prices have attracted more liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes, but Europe lacks the infrastructure to meet all its needs from LNG - a market that was stretched even before the Ukraine war. EU nations are looking to fill underground storage with natural gas supplies to provide households with enough fuel to keep homes warm during winter."

19,"Ad regulator ASCI screens more online gaming ads, finds maximum violations on digital",business," More ads by online real-money gaming brands have come under the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) scanner which has screened hundreds of such ads against potential violations of its guidelines. The ad regulator's guidelines for online real money gaming advertisements had come into effect in December 2020 and since then ASCI has examined  536 ads related to 99 brands, said ASCI's CEO, Manisha Kapoor. ""We've seen a maximum number of violations in the digital medium,"" she added. The ad body April this year also pointed out violations by online gaming advertisements during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. It had screened 35 ads on TV from the online gaming category during the first week of the IPL 15 which is the period between March 26 to April 3 and had identified 14 ads that were in potential violation of its code. Brands including Mobile Premier League (MPL), Junglee Rummy, My11Circle, Gamezy, Betway, and Fairplay had come under ASCI's scrutiny for not complying with its guidelines. Kapoor said that ASCI’s guidelines are very clear when it comes to the violation of its code with regards to online real-money gaming ads. ""The code says that advertisements should not be aimed at minors, not present gaming as a possible source of livelihood, or link it to success. The guidelines also require the ads to carry a disclaimer about a risk of financial loss and the fact that the games are addictive in nature,"" she said. When it comes to the action ASCI takes in case of non-compliance, Kapoor said that they write to the advertiser and once they hear back from them within the stipulated time, the Consumer Complaints Council reviews the ads and the response and makes its recommendations. ""In case the brands do not modify or withdraw ads that are found to be objectionable, ASCI escalates the same to government regulators,"" she said. The ASCI head also highlighted that the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has included the ASCI guidelines as part of The Advertising Code enshrined in The Cable Television and Networks (Regulation) Act. ""Hence, a violation of the ASCI code is also a  violation of the Act,"" said Kapoor. In March this year, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur informed Lok Sabha that over 117 complaints related to online real money gaming were processed by ASCI from January 2021 to 2022. Two months after the guidelines for online real-money gaming ads had come into effect, ASCI had taken action against 81 ads of online gaming platforms out of which in 15 cases, advertisers withdrew ads voluntarily. In 27 cases, advertisers removed ads after the complaint was lodged and in two cases while advertisers contested the objections, the complaints were upheld as the advertisers had violated the ASCI guidelines. Maximum complaints that ASCI had received were for ads featuring on digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Ads by online real-money gaming brands including rummy, poker, and fantasy sports had come under the scanner for their misleading nature which put the consumers at risk, the ad regulator had said. In addition, a large number of online gaming brands have taken to TV and digital to reach out to consumers through advertisements. ""While big advertisers include brands like Dream11, if you see the regional spaces as well as tier-II digital properties, there are nearly 100 players jostling for space, spending a decent amount of money on ads,"" said Ambarish Ray, Co-Founder & CEO of Digital Dogs Content and Media. It is estimated that online gaming firms spent Rs 1,400 crore on advertising last year."
20,Delhi transport dept hiring research fellows to improve EV policy,business," The Delhi transport department is hiring research fellows to advise the government on policy interventions to make the national capital more e-vehicle-friendly, officials said. Interviews were held on June 18 and four candidates shortlisted, they said. ”Two of the shortlisted research fellows are deputy directors in the EV cell, while the other two are freshers. One of them is likely to join by June 25 and another by the end of this month,” an official said. Another official said the transport department was hiring people to help it improve the city government’s EV (electric vehicle) policy. ”They will help us research various aspects like what technologies are available, how charging infrastructure can be improved and policy interventions that can be suggested on the basis of ongoing managerial changes,” he added. The fellows will also conduct research to find out if it is feasible to have all manufactures use standard batteries and whether batteries can be exchanged at charging stations, the official said. ”Just like the European Union has made rules for a uniform charging cord, we will ascertain whether something similar can be done for electric vehicle batteries. One of the key aspects of research will be whether battery charging stations can serve as battery exchange stations and whether batteries can have similar specifications,” he said. The job profile of the researchers will also involve comparing e-vehicle policies of other states with Delhi, and suggesting policy interventions on the basis of ongoing managerial changes, he added. The official said the government was serious about electric vehicles and this move was a step in that direction. ”The experts will strengthen the EV cell, and their suggestions will help the government in implementing policy changes. Those who were interviewed came from varied states and profiles. Some were electrical engineers, some were pursuing their MTech and BTech, and some others were pursuing degrees in environmental science,” he added. The Delhi government has been pushing for adoption of electric vehicles in the national capital in a big way to reduce pollution levels. Under its EV policy, the government has targeted 25 per cent electric vehicles in total vehicle registrations in Delhi by 2024. Since the launch of the EV policy in August 2020, electric vehicles account for more than 12 per cent of total vehicle sales in Delhi. Between August 7, 2020 (when the EV policy was launched) and May 31, a total of 52,429 electric vehicles have been sold in Delhi, with electric two-wheelers comprising the major chunk at 20,385, according to official data."

The visit comes at a time when the Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturing major plans to expand its electronics manufacturing capacity in India, including in semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs). Glad to meet Mr. Young Liu, Chairman, Foxconn. I welcome their plans for expanding electronics manufacturing capacity in India, including in semiconductors. Our push for EV manufacturing is in line with our commitment of Net Zero Emission. pic.twitter.com/sC1AoGWn9c  Foxconn is considering to set up an EV manufacturing unit in India through its subsidiary Foxtron. The Tamil Nadu government is looking to woo the company to further invest in the state and set up the EV manufacturing unit, according to media reports. The company also manufactures iPhones for Apple exclusively in a facility in Sriperumbudur near Chennai. Apart from this, Foxconn's Indian entity, Bharat FIH, operates a separate facility that makes Xiaomi phones. Foxconn has recently entered the electric vehicles market. Earlier this year, the company purchased a plant in the US to produce EVs for the North American market. In its annual report in 2021, the company said that they would replicate this localisation model in South-Asia. The report also stated that a tough year didn't stop Foxconn's consolidated revenue from increasing by 12 percent to $203.7 billion. The developments come at a time when Indian policymakers are trying to create an environment conducive for EV makers, as the country tries to gradually cut down on costly fuel imports and switch to vehicles that run on green energy and reduce pollution. American EV maker Tesla had also been in talks with the Union government over manufacturing in the country as well. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has strongly stated that they would not manufacture in India unless they are allowed to sell and service in the country first. Musk has repeatedly cited India's high import duties as the biggest roadblock for Tesla to enter the country and have urged the government for them to be reduced."

Multiple rounds of grilling Joshi said he had made himself available for multiple rounds of questioning first by the investigating firms and then later by the capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The only time he was unavailable was when he was attending to his father-in-law, who had been admitted in hospital for surgery, he claimed in his lawsuit. Axis MF’s claims about him being unavailable for questioning pertained to the period between May 3, when he was suspended, and May 18, when his employment was terminated. Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify Joshi’s whereabouts during this period, although his father-in-law’s medical records and hospitalisation proof (including his admission and discharge details) during the period are part of Joshi’s legal filings in the Bombay High Court. Nor could Moneycontrol independently verify the veracity of Joshi’s responses to the investigations, one of the main charges behind his sacking. Due process followed Axis AMC said to Moneycontrol that “post the suo moto investigation which started in February 2022, we (i.e. the AMC) had reason to act upon the interim findings, after diligently following due process.” A email send to AZB didn’t elicit a response."
1,What is the EU gas crisis? Here's all you need to know,business," Amid reduced flows of Russian gas supply, European nations are left scrambling for alternative choices buoyed by inflationary pressures and supply chain disturbances. Gas prices have hit record levels in Europe, adding to challenges for policymakers trying to haul Europe back from an economic slowdown. Also Read: What are Europe's options in case of Russian gas disruption? EU relied on Russia for 40 percent of its gas needs before war: The European Union (EU) relied on Russia for as much as 40 percent of its gas needs before the Russia-Ukraine war — rising to 55 percent for Germany, leaving a huge gap to fill in an already tight global gas market. According to experts, coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel in terms of emissions, yet the most important target for replacement to alternative energy sources, reported Reuters. Coal as an alternative choice: The energy disruption has prompted some European governments to reconsider coal, one of the dirtiest and most polluting ways of producing energy. Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands have indicated that coal-fired plants could be used to compensate for a cut in Russian gas supplies. Reports suggest that the energy crisis could see Europe delay its transition away from fossil fuels, although policymakers insist the burning of coal is a necessary stopgap to help prevent a winter supply shortage. Also Read: Russia crimps gas flows just as Europe races to stock up for winter Nord Stream 1 operating at 40 per cent capacity: Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has cut capacity through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that runs to Germany under the Baltic Sea, citing the delayed return of equipment serviced by Germany’s Siemens Energy in Canada. However, Russian gas is still being pumped via Ukraine, but at a reduced rate. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic, a vital supply route to Germany, is working at just 40 percent capacity. Also Read: As Russia cuts gas, German industry grapples with painful choices Germany risks recession; enters Phase 2 of 3-stage emergency gas plan: Germany faces certain recession if faltering Russian gas supplies stop completely, an industry body warned earlier in the week, and Italy said it would consider offering financial backing to help companies refill gas storage to avoid a deeper crisis in winter. Germany has entered Phase 2 of its three-stage emergency gas plan on Thursday due to reduced supply from Russia and high prices, but is not yet triggering a clause that lets utilities pass on soaring gas costs to customers, reported Reuters. The Phase 2 ""alarm stage"" kicks in when the government sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages of gas. Facing dwindling gas flows from main supplier Russia, Europe's largest economy had been at Phase 1 of its emergency plan since end-March. It faces the unprecedented prospect of businesses and consumers running out of energy. Meanwhile, Germany has also warned that Russia’s moves to slash Europe’s natural gas supplies risked sparking a collapse in energy markets, drawing a parallel to the role of Lehman Brothers in triggering the financial crisis, reported Bloomberg news. Also Read: What LNG can and can’t do to replace Europe’s imports of Russian gas Europe lacks infrastructure to meet LNG storage needs: To add to the pressure, soaring European prices have attracted more liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes, but Europe lacks the infrastructure to meet all its needs from LNG - a market that was stretched even before the Ukraine war. EU nations are looking to fill underground storage with natural gas supplies to provide households with enough fuel to keep homes warm during winter."

4,"Ad regulator ASCI screens more online gaming ads, finds maximum violations on digital",business," More ads by online real-money gaming brands have come under the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) scanner which has screened hundreds of such ads against potential violations of its guidelines. The ad regulator's guidelines for online real money gaming advertisements had come into effect in December 2020 and since then ASCI has examined  536 ads related to 99 brands, said ASCI's CEO, Manisha Kapoor. ""We've seen a maximum number of violations in the digital medium,"" she added. The ad body April this year also pointed out violations by online gaming advertisements during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. It had screened 35 ads on TV from the online gaming category during the first week of the IPL 15 which is the period between March 26 to April 3 and had identified 14 ads that were in potential violation of its code. Brands including Mobile Premier League (MPL), Junglee Rummy, My11Circle, Gamezy, Betway, and Fairplay had come under ASCI's scrutiny for not complying with its guidelines. Kapoor said that ASCI’s guidelines are very clear when it comes to the violation of its code with regards to online real-money gaming ads. ""The code says that advertisements should not be aimed at minors, not present gaming as a possible source of livelihood, or link it to success. The guidelines also require the ads to carry a disclaimer about a risk of financial loss and the fact that the games are addictive in nature,"" she said. When it comes to the action ASCI takes in case of non-compliance, Kapoor said that they write to the advertiser and once they hear back from them within the stipulated time, the Consumer Complaints Council reviews the ads and the response and makes its recommendations. ""In case the brands do not modify or withdraw ads that are found to be objectionable, ASCI escalates the same to government regulators,"" she said. The ASCI head also highlighted that the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has included the ASCI guidelines as part of The Advertising Code enshrined in The Cable Television and Networks (Regulation) Act. ""Hence, a violation of the ASCI code is also a  violation of the Act,"" said Kapoor. In March this year, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur informed Lok Sabha that over 117 complaints related to online real money gaming were processed by ASCI from January 2021 to 2022. Two months after the guidelines for online real-money gaming ads had come into effect, ASCI had taken action against 81 ads of online gaming platforms out of which in 15 cases, advertisers withdrew ads voluntarily. In 27 cases, advertisers removed ads after the complaint was lodged and in two cases while advertisers contested the objections, the complaints were upheld as the advertisers had violated the ASCI guidelines. Maximum complaints that ASCI had received were for ads featuring on digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Ads by online real-money gaming brands including rummy, poker, and fantasy sports had come under the scanner for their misleading nature which put the consumers at risk, the ad regulator had said. In addition, a large number of online gaming brands have taken to TV and digital to reach out to consumers through advertisements. ""While big advertisers include brands like Dream11, if you see the regional spaces as well as tier-II digital properties, there are nearly 100 players jostling for space, spending a decent amount of money on ads,"" said Ambarish Ray, Co-Founder & CEO of Digital Dogs Content and Media. It is estimated that online gaming firms spent Rs 1,400 crore on advertising last year."
5,Delhi transport dept hiring research fellows to improve EV policy,business," The Delhi transport department is hiring research fellows to advise the government on policy interventions to make the national capital more e-vehicle-friendly, officials said. Interviews were held on June 18 and four candidates shortlisted, they said. ”Two of the shortlisted research fellows are deputy directors in the EV cell, while the other two are freshers. One of them is likely to join by June 25 and another by the end of this month,” an official said. Another official said the transport department was hiring people to help it improve the city government’s EV (electric vehicle) policy. ”They will help us research various aspects like what technologies are available, how charging infrastructure can be improved and policy interventions that can be suggested on the basis of ongoing managerial changes,” he added. The fellows will also conduct research to find out if it is feasible to have all manufactures use standard batteries and whether batteries can be exchanged at charging stations, the official said. ”Just like the European Union has made rules for a uniform charging cord, we will ascertain whether something similar can be done for electric vehicle batteries. One of the key aspects of research will be whether battery charging stations can serve as battery exchange stations and whether batteries can have similar specifications,” he said. The job profile of the researchers will also involve comparing e-vehicle policies of other states with Delhi, and suggesting policy interventions on the basis of ongoing managerial changes, he added. The official said the government was serious about electric vehicles and this move was a step in that direction. ”The experts will strengthen the EV cell, and their suggestions will help the government in implementing policy changes. Those who were interviewed came from varied states and profiles. Some were electrical engineers, some were pursuing their MTech and BTech, and some others were pursuing degrees in environmental science,” he added. The Delhi government has been pushing for adoption of electric vehicles in the national capital in a big way to reduce pollution levels. Under its EV policy, the government has targeted 25 per cent electric vehicles in total vehicle registrations in Delhi by 2024. Since the launch of the EV policy in August 2020, electric vehicles account for more than 12 per cent of total vehicle sales in Delhi. Between August 7, 2020 (when the EV policy was launched) and May 31, a total of 52,429 electric vehicles have been sold in Delhi, with electric two-wheelers comprising the major chunk at 20,385, according to official data."

The visit comes at a time when the Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturing major plans to expand its electronics manufacturing capacity in India, including in semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs). Glad to meet Mr. Young Liu, Chairman, Foxconn. I welcome their plans for expanding electronics manufacturing capacity in India, including in semiconductors. Our push for EV manufacturing is in line with our commitment of Net Zero Emission. pic.twitter.com/sC1AoGWn9c  Foxconn is considering to set up an EV manufacturing unit in India through its subsidiary Foxtron. The Tamil Nadu government is looking to woo the company to further invest in the state and set up the EV manufacturing unit, according to media reports. The company also manufactures iPhones for Apple exclusively in a facility in Sriperumbudur near Chennai. Apart from this, Foxconn's Indian entity, Bharat FIH, operates a separate facility that makes Xiaomi phones. Foxconn has recently entered the electric vehicles market. Earlier this year, the company purchased a plant in the US to produce EVs for the North American market. In its annual report in 2021, the company said that they would replicate this localisation model in South-Asia. The report also stated that a tough year didn't stop Foxconn's consolidated revenue from increasing by 12 percent to $203.7 billion. The developments come at a time when Indian policymakers are trying to create an environment conducive for EV makers, as the country tries to gradually cut down on costly fuel imports and switch to vehicles that run on green energy and reduce pollution. American EV maker Tesla had also been in talks with the Union government over manufacturing in the country as well. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has strongly stated that they would not manufacture in India unless they are allowed to sell and service in the country first. Musk has repeatedly cited India's high import duties as the biggest roadblock for Tesla to enter the country and have urged the government for them to be reduced."

11,"Amid startup layoffs, larger job market remains buoyant across sectors",business," The larger job market in India remains buoyant across sectors – even amid layoffs by a clutch of startups in recent months – and employees will generally continue to call the shots through FY23. “We see FY23 to remain an employees’ market with some amount of adjustments. Employees still have the bargaining power, opportunities and enjoy the benefit of demand,” said RP Yadav, chairman of Genius Consultants, a staffing and human resource company. While information technology and IT-enabled services will continue recruiting, e-commerce, logistics and export-oriented sectors including textiles and leather goods are doing well in terms of hiring. The consumer goods sector will increasingly do well, as will the retail and hospitality segment, according to staffing firms, HR experts and talent managers. The near-normal level of economic activity in retail and hospitality is indicative of a revival in these sectors after a prolonged phase of weakness due to the pandemic and offers a positive sign for the larger labour market, they said. While thousands of people have lost jobs in the startup space, the number is small if one looks at the larger employment market canvas, experts said. More than 10,500 Indian employees working in startups were let go in 2022, according to data based on Moneycontrol Research and other media reports. India’s employment rate increased marginally to 37.07 percent in May from 37.05 percent in April, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a private entity. Strong environment “A bit of calibration is happening but the overall employment environment is still strong and will remain positive across sectors,” said Suchita Dutta, executive director of Indian Staffing Federation. “Some startups have laid off people as investors and promoters are focusing on profitability over growth projections. But it may not be a barometer of the overall employment market in the country, which is vast, diverse and layered.” Amrit Jaidka Arora, chief human resource officer at Digit Insurance, a unicorn backed by Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Group, said the company is increasing headcount continuously and working to fill 600 positions across technical and non-technical roles. Dutta said several staffing firms are not able to supply temporary workers to the tune of 30 percent of late, which shows appetite is strong and there is a demand-supply mismatch. Experts and talent managers said that while there is keenness to hire more freshers including apprentices, mid-level and senior executive hiring won’t get subdued. This is true in segments of startups as well. The assessment syncs with official indicators like exports, which have jumped in the first two months of FY23, and positive net payroll numbers. Besides, consulting firms Aon and Deloitte have projected a very good appraisal season this year, indicative of employer focus on talent retention. India’s merchandise exports rose 22.5 percent to $77.08 billion in the first two months of the current financial year (April and May) from a year earlier. The latest net payroll numbers as calculated by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation jumped in April from a year ago and a month ago. The EPFO  added a net 1.7 million subscribers in April. Sectoral overview Yadav of Genius Consultants said IT and ITeS hiring will continue and won’t taper in FY23. Retail has picked up well and demand for workers in export-oriented sectors such as leather goods and textiles is steady. There’s good traction in the tea sector, too. “We see job creation remaining steady this year and even afterwards” with the government’s spending and focus on infrastructure and defence, Yadav said. In the manufacturing sector, factory floor jobs are going up and as the economy normalises further, it will do better, he said. In banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), there is demand for support services and marketing roles. In consumer products, support and sales as well as factory floor roles are in demand. Recruiters and staffing firms said in logistics, there is good demand from companies for staffing in warehousing and delivery. In retail, 30 percent of the jobs available and created are for office roles and the rest for stores and warehouses. “If you visit a food court or a mall, let’s say in NCR, one will realise that footfalls have gone up significantly, which effectively means headcount additions are going on too to match demand,” Dutta of ISF said. She said over the next six months, the fast moving consumer goods and the fast moving consumer durables segments will absorb more people. Demand for gig workers is up and e-commerce continues to be a strong employer. The central bank’s action to tame inflation by increasing interest rates won’t harm the employment market, she added. On startups, Dutta said while edtech has seen a softening of demand, the reopening of physical campuses in school and higher education segments has created good opportunities. “Startup hiring is a bit soft in patches, but we continue to see good demand within the ecosystem. A large number of startups are not spoken of or written about actively but they continue to hire,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, chief executive of human resources firm CIEL HR. Even online job portals such as Naukri and Monster have projected a strong momentum in the employment market."
12,Buy Gujarat Gas; target of Rs 650: Motilal Oswal,business," Motilal Oswal's research report on Gujarat Gas Spot LNG prices have risen to USD34/mmBtu from USD19/mmBtu in CY21, making alternate fuels such as LPG more attractive in Morbi, Gujarat. However, we highlight that over the long term, LNG would continue to remain cheaper than LPG, except during the summer season. Further, increased availability of domestic gas over the few months is likely to help GUJGA reduce its sourcing cost, thereby help improve its margins. GUJGA trades at 20x FY24 EPS of INR25. We expect its volume to register a CAGR of 13% over FY22-24E. Valuing the stock at 26x FY24E EPS, we reiterate our Buy rating on the company and retain it as our top pick in the sector.  Outlook We estimate 11.8/13.5mmscmd of total sales in FY23/24, up from 10.7mmscmd in FY22. Our EBITDA/scm estimate stands at INR5.5 for FY23/24, up from INR5.3 in FY22.

13,Why US Fed must extend dollar swap lines to BRICS central banks,business," Now that it is apparent that the United States Fed no longer considers important, the impact of its actions on the global economy, let’s ponder on a bit of history. In 2007, when the global financial crisis was attaining colossal proportions, the Fed had an epiphany regarding its responsibility towards ‘other countries’. Realising that safe-haven demand for the US dollar will send the greenback’s value soaring, the Fed established the Dollar Liquidity Swap Lines under the authority of ‘Section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act.’ Fourteen so-called primary central banks of the world were identified, and allowed to swap their respective currencies with the USD at a mutually agreed spot rate. The logic behind this arrangement was that the identified central banks could borrow cheap USD and distribute it within their respective domestic economies through commercial bank networks. Once the contracts expired, the borrowing central banks would return the USD to the Fed at a pre-determined exchange rate. Strategically or not, apart from the Bank of Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, none of the 14 central banks were from Asia or Africa. While the BRICS moniker gained prominence only a few years later, no attempts were made to provide such facilities to those countries in subsequent iterations, despite their exposure to the USD. By 2010, short-term USD funding arrangements were limited to five central banks: the European Central Bank (ECB), The Bank of England, Swiss Central Bank, The Bank of Japan, and The Bank of Canada. In 2013, the Fed decided that the Dollar Liquidity Swap Lines arrangement would be converted into a standing arrangement with these five banks. What made the Fed identify these banks as systemically important is still nebulous; nevertheless, this lack of empathy towards vulnerable emerging markets may accelerate attempts of de-dollarisation of the global economy, and a search for an alternative reserve currency or a rather basket of currencies. Amid normalisation, the USD’s ascent is bringing about havoc in emerging markets, especially frontier economies. The double impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war has already destroyed such fragile economies, and the Fed’s actions are further exposing them to a variety of external shocks. “An aggressive rate hike cycle in the US will keep the markets nervous near term, as it increases potential macro and flow volatility, and forces emerging market central banks to follow suit,” Amit Tripathi, CIO (Debt) at Nippon Mutual Fund, told this author. The situation is made worse by the depletion of foreign reserve holdings among their central banks, which are fighting a lost battle to safeguard respective currencies. Rising interest rate environment in the US leads to investor indifference, leaving these central banks with little to no fire power to retain their reserves. This is because most emerging market foreign reserves are primarily denominated in USD. As debt servicing deadlines approach and galloping commodity inflation mounts pressure on emerging market central banks, the purchase of USD from the open market becomes paramount. Reversal of quantitative easing, however, renders the USD too expensive for these countries, since their significantly depreciated currencies are no longer potent to make such purchases in both spot and forward markets. Given this ongoing mayhem, maybe it’s time that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s attention is diverted towards the potential of the BRICS swap lines, and its implication on the USD. In 2014, with the New Development Bank, the BRICS also set into motion the BRICS Contingency Reserve Agreement (BCRA). With a capital of $100 billion, this arrangement is touted to be a possible alternative to the US Federal Reserve’s Foreign Currency Liquidity Swap Lines, acting as a liquidity manager for BRICS nations. Nevertheless, given its small capital size and the mutual discontent among members, the fund doesn’t yet have enough fire power. Things, however, can change rapidly, as dissatisfaction with the Fed is imminent. “The terminal Repo rate would be in the range of 6-6.5 percent, with front loading of rate hikes over the next 12-15 months. This is reasonably priced in by the debt markets,” says Tripathi, pointing out the vulnerabilities of even large BRICS economies such as India. All but a higher capitalisation is needed to make the BCRA an effective swap platform among BRICS nation, reducing their dependence on the USD. With further evolution, the arrangement can not only become the custodian of BRICS currencies but also facilitate inter-central bank swap lines with smaller frontier economies, now significantly dependent on countries such as China. It is highly probable that continued Fed apathy could lead to multiple parallel systems against the USD, in a word that is frankly a ‘Bretton Woods’ construct. If the Fed wants to safeguard its credibility along with that of the USD as a reserve currency, it must reconsider its strategic hedges in a changing world order. That said, for vulnerable economies in Asia and Africa, there is really nothing to lose by adopting an alternative to the USD, as the Fed is not coming to anyone’s rescue. "
14,Disney’s stakeholder capitalism vs Netflix’s shareholder capitalism,business," Wouldn’t it be nice if companies cared less about profits and more about the social good? It’s popular to think so. Stakeholder capitalism is fashionable. Shareholder capitalism is not. Many high-profile business leaders and academics now condemn the idea Milton Friedman laid out in a famous 1970 New York Times Magazine essay: ‘a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.’ If only this wicked notion of maximising profits hadn’t come along, some seem to think, we’d live in a progressive utopia of high wages, racial harmony, economic equality, and environmental purity. In 2019, the Business Roundtable repudiated the Friedman doctrine, changing its ‘Principles of Corporate Governance’ to embrace the goal of managing companies for the “benefit of all stakeholders — customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.” It didn’t specify how businesses would resolve conflicts between constituencies. The usual response is that conflicts are illusory. Do good and you’ll do well. “In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders,” wrote BlackRock’s Larry Fink in his 2022 letter to CEOs, reiterating the message that made news in 2018: “To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” Of course, if stakeholder-pleasing endeavours and the creation of economic value always went hand-in-hand, stakeholder and shareholder capitalism would be identical. But life isn’t that simple. Contrary to what you may have heard, letting stakeholders take precedence over business objectives is anything but nice. Stakeholder capitalism isn’t just a temptation for managers to pursue their pet interests. It’s a prescription for culture wars, political backlash, managerial paralysis, and human-resources nightmares. Every effective enterprise has to consider the interests of employees, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. But not everyone wants the same thing, and sometimes organisations have to make trade-offs between goals everyone might agree are good. The question is what to do when faced with a conflict. Without an eye on value maximisation, it’s too easy for managers to dissipate company resources by pursuing their personal interests. The great value of the Friedman doctrine is that it establishes a coherent standard for making trade-offs. Maximising economic value tells you to “spend an additional dollar on any constituency provided the long-term value added to the firm from such expenditure is a dollar or more,” as Harvard Business School economist Michael Jensen put it in a 2010 article. Stakeholder theory, by contrast, tells you nothing. It assumes you just make everybody happy. As Jensen wrote, “Without the clarity of mission provided by a single-valued objective function, companies embracing stakeholder theory will experience managerial confusion, conflict, inefficiency, and perhaps even competitive failure.” Jensen’s article is the best articulation of why what he calls “enlightened value maximization” is indispensable. But neither he nor Friedman fully imagined the chaos that could ensue without it. Look at the backlash when Walt Disney Co. tried to placate vocal employees by opposing Florida legislation to ban discussing sexual orientation with younger children in schools. The political pushback — like the original protests — reflected a sense of betrayal by a beloved company whose fans see their dreams and values reflected in its characters and stories. Appeasing one group of stakeholders alienated others. It wasn’t hard for conservatives to find opposing voices within the company. Disney has nearly 200,000 employees, and countless customers. All are stakeholders, and they represent every conceivable viewpoint. By focusing on business goals, by contrast, Netflix, despite other challenges, has more successfully weathered its own controversies, from conservative uproar over the French film ‘Cuties’ to more recent protests about Dave Chappelle’s jokes about trans women. To make expectations clear, the company revised its cultural guidelines for employees to explicitly say, “As employees we support the principle that Netflix offers a diversity of stories, even if we find some titles counter to our own personal values.” Stakeholder capitalism implicitly assumes a cultural consensus identical to whatever its advocates believe. It harks back to the mid-20th century, when big US companies enjoyed little competition, mass media marginalised all but a narrow range of political, religious, and social views, and hierarchy and security dominated worker expectations. It pretends social media, Slack channels and “bringing your whole self to work” don’t exist. For a purer version of what stakeholder-oriented management can engender, forget profits and political disagreements. Look at the turmoil roiling all sorts of Left-wing non-profits. In a report in the Intercept, Ryan Grim details why Washington DC-based groups have spent the past few years engaged in ‘knock-down, drag-out fights between competing factions of their organizations, most often breaking down along staff-versus-management lines.’ He writes that: ‘Instead of fueling a groundswell of public support to reinvigorate the [Democratic] party’s ambitious agenda, most of the foundation-backed organizations that make up the backbone of the party’s ideological infrastructure were still spending their time locked in virtual retreats, Slack wars, and healing sessions, grappling with tensions over hierarchy, patriarchy, race, gender, and power….’ Grim quotes the executive director of one such group, anonymously: “A lot of staff that work for me, they expect the organization to be all the things: a movement, OK, get out the vote, OK, healing, OK, take care of you when you’re sick, OK. It’s all the things,” said one executive director. “Can you get your love and healing at home, please? But I can’t say that, they would crucify me.” Despite their commitments to making the world a better place — and general agreement on what that means — trying to please every vocal stakeholder is wreaking such widespread organisational havoc that one group’s head, also quoted anonymously, told Grim “you couldn’t conceive of a better Right-wing plot to paralyze progressive leaders.” The problem isn’t that the groups are Leftist. It’s that their missions and decisions are constantly up for internal debate. New attitudes and forms of communication have destroyed the legitimacy of their managerial hierarchies. Compared with mission-oriented non-profits, businesses that focus on creating economic value are fortunate to have a clear definition of success. If they want to make the world a nicer place, they should strive to defend that standard. Virginia Postrel is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

15,"Urban cooperative banks need to focus on symmetric development, adopt modern banking methods:  Cooperation Minister Amit  Shah",business," Asserting that urban cooperative banks (UCBs) need to focus on symmetric development, Cooperation Minister Amit Shah on Thursday asked UCBs to undertake key reforms including hiring young talent and adopting modern banking methods in order remain competitive. Structural changes, strengthening of human resources, computerising accounting process, hiring experts to handle surplus funds are the other reforms that UCBs need to undertake in order to compete with nationalised and private banks, he said. By implementing these reforms, the UCBs should make themselves more irrelevant in the current times, the minister said and assured that cooperative banks will not be treated like a ""second grade citizen"". ""There are 1,534 urban cooperative banks, 54 scheduled urban cooperative banks, 35 multi-state cooperative banks, 580 multi-state cooperative credit societies, 22 state cooperatives. We have a wide presence but it is uneven. … We need to properly work on symmetric development of urban cooperative banks,"" Shah said addressing an event here. Since cooperative banks are the only banks that lend to the lower strata of the society, there is a need to set up at least one UCB in every town in the country, he said and directed the National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies (NAFCUS) to focus on symmetric development of UCBs across India. ""Symmetric expansion will help us remain in the competition. Successful banks should also come forward and contribute to this,"" he said. Presently, the role of urban cooperative banks is negligible in the total banking sector in terms of deposit and advance payment, he added. Asserting that there is huge scope for expansion of UCBs and cooperative credit societies, the Minister said it is because there is increased economic activity in urban centres with 40 per cent urbanisation in the country. UCBs are necessary for the overall development of the country as these are the only banks that can lend to lower sections of the society. ""We need to uplift the lower section and make them part of the country's economic development. This can be done by cooperatives alone,"" he said. The role of UCBs is such that loans provided by them have helped some set up major businesses in the country, Shah said and shared that he knew at least three such top businessmen who got first Rs 5 lakh loan from urban cooperative banks and they are now major contributors to the country's GDP. Listing out the key reforms, the Minister said UCBs cannot be satisfied with the current growth, having Rs 5 lakh deposit and Rs 3 lakh crore advance payment. ""This may appear big, but what is its share in the total banking sector? Urban cooperative banks' share in deposit is only 3.25 per cent, while in advance payment it is 2.69 per cent. We need to expand this,"" he said. For expansion of UCBs, he said structural changes are required and the next generation having banking experience should be hired for better operation of the banks. The systems should be modernised, accounting should be computerised, accounting alerts should be put in place besides infusing young talent. For expansion of UCBs, he said structural changes are required and the next generation having banking experience should be hired for better operation of the banks. Transparency in recruitment and hiring experts to handle surplus funds is necessary, he said. ""Along with cooperative spirit, we need to adopt modern banking methods, then only we will be able to remain in the competition,"" he said. While cooperative banks need to improve their reliability, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the other hand should relax restrictions, he added. Shah also highlighted that the government is building a data bank of cooperatives, setting up a separate university for cooperatives, besides framing a new policy. The minister also felicitated several urban cooperative banks which have completed 100 years of operation. Minister of state for cooperation B L Verma, National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies (NAFCUB) President Jyotindra Mehta and Cooperation Secretary Gyanesh Kumar were present at the event."
16,Banking | Creative destruction of existing models will pose new challenges for regulators,business," RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das recently gave a speech at the Financial Express Modern BFSI Summit in Mumbai. Das discussed the ongoing technological disruptions in the financial sector, and how the disruptions are creating new opportunities for the financial sector. The opportunities have led to emergence of new banking models which are posing challenges for regulators. Historically, finance has always been influenced by technological developments. In finance, information is critical as it helps in screening lenders/borrowers and trading in financial assets. Technological developments that enable faster flow of information have always found early adoption in finance. Whether it is communication technology such as pigeons or telegraph, or travel technology such as railways, the financial sector has embraced them with open hands. Hence, it was not surprising to see the financial sector being an early adopter of the computer, the Internet, and advancements in mobile technology. While it is not really new to see the financial sector applying the latest technology, what is new is how technology is shaping and changing finance and banking, perhaps forever. Traditional banks are moving away from physical branch banking to digital banking. As per Das, “this paradigm shift has been possible due to innovations in information technology (IT), growth in mobile and internet connectivity, market-based financial intermediation, and the advent of Fintech”.The traditional banks competed over location and customer service in branches. Today the competition is moved to customer services over apps and other digital interfaces. Technology has allowed fintechs to offer financial services. The fintechs are technology specialists such as mobile companies, software companies, and so on, which leverage their technical skills to offer superior financial services than traditional banks. In particular, fintechs have innovated significantly in the space of payments and small ticket loans to financially excluded populations. There are few very large technological companies called BigTech, which offer fintech experience at a much larger scale. The major BigTech players are Amazon, Google, and Alibaba. While fintechs are mainly complementary to traditional banks, BigTechs threaten the traditional banks as they have the ability and capability to offer comprehensive banking services at a global level. Both fintechs and BigTechs use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models to analyse data about potential borrowers from a wide range of traditional and non-traditional sources of data. Technology has created another banking model named Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi is a platform which brings together lenders and borrowers, and there are no intermediaries. Traditional banks and to an extent fintechs and BigTechs screen borrowers by capturing information about them. DeFi is based on blockchain where information about lenders and borrowers is not available as it is hidden behind cryptographic digital signatures. Thus, DeFi platforms rely on collateral to align the incentives of borrowers and lenders. Das mentioned that there are three approaches to regulation. First is activity-based regulation, where all the entities are regulated irrespective of their legal status. For example, commercial banks and large cooperative banks/non-banking financial companies are regulated similarly irrespective of their legal status. Second is entity-based regulation, where regulations are applied to licensed entities or groups that engage in similar and specified activities. For example, commercial banks and co-operative banks will be regulated separately. Third, is outcome-based regulation, which sets some basic, common, and technology- or business model-neutral outcomes for the regulated entities. He mentioned that for regulating fintechs, the RBI follows a hybrid approach of activity-based and entity-based regulations to ensure entities grow in an orderly fashion. The RBI has not allowed BigTechs to offer banking services barring payment services. Having said that, there was a recent tie-up between Equitas Small Finance Bank and Google Pay wherein the latter’s subscribers could move their savings to the former and earn an interest. In a way Google Pay started to resemble a payment bank which also takes deposits and offers payment services. Technology has broken traditional boundaries and it is not clear for how long RBI can prohibit the BigTechs from offering financial services. DeFi is still in nascent stages in India, but one has to still think about regulating these entities. Das says the DeFi model poses unique challenges as there is anonymity and lack of a centralised governance body. He suggests the need for a ‘globally co-ordinated regulatory approach and inter-regulatory co-ordination’ to enable comprehensive assessment of Defi activities and mitigation of their risks. Early 20th century political economist Joseph Schumpeter famously wrote that creative destruction is an essential feature of capitalism where the new products and processes replace the old ways. We are seeing Schumpeterian creative destruction replacing the old ways of functioning in the world of business and finance. As the creative destruction process is underway, there is tremendous uncertainty for both the players and the regulators. The core function of banking will remain, but the way we understand a bank in terms of branches and bank officers, is going to change forever. The changes will pose threats to financial stability, and regulators will be required to maintain a constant vigilance."
17,"IBBI’s proposed amendments to liquidation regulations may help banks streamline recovery process, say experts",business," The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India’s (IBBI) suggested changes to liquidation regulations, if implemented, could help banks maximise recoveries in a time-bound manner, said at least six bankers and legal experts Moneycontrol spoke to on June 23. “The proposed amendments are possibly a solution to practical difficulties faced in the liquidation regime and the failure to achieve the timelines,” said Sushmita Gandhi, partner, IndusLaw. “It is a genuine attempt to fill those gaps to work out a comparatively efficacious regime.” “The amendments hold a strong potential for reducing banks’ haircuts by imposing stricter timelines for the completion of the liquidation process,” Gandhi added. Liquidation is the process of monetising a company’s assets, and using those funds to repay the company’s debts. The liquidation process starts in case the insolvency resolution process fails or the committee of creditors (CoC) decides to liquidate the company at any time during the insolvency process. Also read: 47% of IBC cases ended in liquidation till FY22, shows IBBI data What are the proposed amendments? In a 15-page discussion paper released on June 14, the IBBI said that the goal of a time-bound liquidation process in India is yet to be achieved. To reduce delay by further streamlining the process, the IBBI has proposed a slew of regulations with an aim to provide a better monitoring framework of the liquidation process and prescribe a timeline framework for auction of assets. Under the proposed changes, the IBBI has said that a CoC may act as a stakeholders’ consultation committee (SCC). The latter works as a monitoring mechanism for liquidation, and is typically set up within 60 days from the date of commencement of liquidation. It is also proposed that creditors can now replace the liquidator, by a majority vote not less than 66 percent, in case his conduct is not satisfactory. Further, the IBBI has proposed that the CoC, in its last meeting, may decide whether it would explore a compromise or arrangement when the liquidation is proposed. If so, the CoC will use the time taken by the adjudicating authority for exploring a compromise or arrangement. “Since this time will also be available with the members of CoC who are also members of the initial SCC, time of 90 days given for concluding compromise or arrangement is proposed to be reduced to 30 days,” the IBBI said. The IBBI has sought public feedback on the proposals by July 5. “The proposed amendments, though they would not vastly impact the resolution process, would still strengthen the position of the creditors and secure them,” said Sonam Chandwani, managing partner, KS Legal and Associates. “If the creditors manage to secure a strong place despite being in an advisory position, it could surely reduce the extent of a haircut for banks.” What do the numbers tell us? As per data available with the IBBI, 1,666 corporate insolvency resolution processes ended up with an order for liquidation as on May 31. Out of these, liquidators submitted final reports in compliance with the adjudicating authority only in 346 cases. These cases took an average completion period of 471 days. The completion period has been increasing steadily from 2018. Further, out of 1,320 ongoing liquidation cases, almost half have already crossed two years. The law requires that the liquidator should liquidate the corporate debtor within a period of one year from the liquidation commencement date. Such an inordinate delay compromises the objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to maximise recoveries for creditors as the value of assets declines with time. “The proposed amendments would definitely make the entire process more transparent and accountable leading to the maximisation of the value of the assets of the corporate debtor by cutting down the timeline for completing the entire liquidation process,” said Sandeep Bajaj, managing partner, PSL Advocates & Solicitors. If the liquidation regulations are amended thereby making advice of the stakeholders binding upon the liquidator, it will lead to greater accountability, Bajaj added. Bankers agreed with Bajaj’s view. “Banks already brace themselves for a large haircut when a company is admitted into the insolvency process and ultimately liquidation. The proposed amendments, if implemented, will go a long way in empowering creditors and realise the best value of assets,” said a banker with a state-run bank on condition of anonymity. Key lies in implementation Experts said that the IBBI appears to be inclined to put more checks and balances to regulate the conduct of the liquidators who currently have more flexibility to make decisions. It could also give more power to creditors in the liquidation process. However, the key lies in implementation. In the current scenario, banks are forced to opt for liquidation given the long-drawn legal process and the tepid bidding appetite of suitors following the COVID-19 pandemic. Strict timelines prescribed under the IBC, multiplicity of cases and lesser number of tribunals have increased the backlog of cases. “Although the extent of the haircut depends on a case-to-case basis, some increase in recoveries is expected, albeit all will depend on execution,” said another banker at the stressed asset department of a state-run lender. “While the proposals seem excellent on paper, the implementation and execution part will be key.” According to Kumar Saurabh Singh, partner at law firm Khaitan & Company, the IBBI should also consider engaging more with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) so that the timelines prescribed by it are not diluted through the tribunal’s orders. Most NCLT orders tend to lean towards equity rather than adherence to strict timelines, Singh said. As far as the reduction of time frame from 90 days to 30 days for concluding compromise or arrangement is concerned, it seems really difficult as putting all the pieces together within 30 days may not be practical, said Ajay Shaw, partner at DSK Legal. “In fact, where sale of assets has not happened despite several attempts, it may be advisable to put the entire assets in trust for the benefit of the stakeholders as per the waterfall under Section 53 (where as and when the assets are monetised the amounts can be distributed basis the pre-agreed waterfall) and formally liquidate the corporate debtor,” added Shaw."
18,Statiq raises $25.7 million in funding round led by Shell Ventures,business," Electric vehicle charging network startup Statiq on Thursday said it has raised USD 25.7 million (over Rs 200 crore) in a funding round led by Shell Ventures. The company will use the Series A funding to primarily invest in product engineering and network infrastructure, Statiq said in a statement.

On its investment in the start-up, Shell Ventures Chief Investment Officer Robert Linck said, ""With its consumer-centric approach, we believe Statiq is on-track to lead the EV charging experience in India. Our investment in Statiq stands for our belief in their potential and our shared ambition to accelerate the electrification of mobility solutions."""
19,"Technical View | Nifty forms Spinning Top pattern, but RSI & Stochastic show sentiments improving",business," The Nifty50 showed a smart recovery in the last couple of hours of trade and closed nearly a percent higher on June 23 following the positive trend in Asian counterparts. The index witnessed a formation of the bullish candle which resembles the Spinning Top kind of pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisiveness among bulls and bears, but as long as it holds 15,380-15,400 levels as support, the recovery could be possible initially towards 15,700-15,800 levels. In the afternoon, the index strongly defended support levels on a closing basis, though there was volatility on the weekly expiry day. The spinning top is often regarded as a neutral pattern that suggests indecisiveness in the market. It can be formed in an uptrend as well as in a downtrend. The rally was also seen in broader space as the Nifty Midcap 100 index gained 1.2 percent and Smallcap 100 index rose 1.3 percent on positive breadth. More than two shares advanced for every share falling on the NSE. India VIX, the fear index, fell 1.97 percent to 20.88 levels, giving comfort to bulls. If the trend sustains and the volatility falls below the crucial 20 mark, then that could bring more stability to the market, experts said. The Nifty50 opened moderately higher at 15,452 and climbed above 15,600 levels but lost all the gains in late morning deals and hit a day's low of 15,367.50 in the afternoon session. However, there was a sharp recovery in the last couple of hours helping the index close 143 points higher at 15,557, supported by auto, banks, FMCG, IT, and pharma stocks. ""Albeit Nifty50 registered an indecisive formation called Spinning Top, the index appears to be finding some support around 15,380 levels, which is the lower end of the bullish gap zone registered on June 21. Hence, as long as this counter sustains above 15,382 on a closing basis, hopes of a pullback rally remain alive,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Founder & Chief Market Strategist at Chartviewindia said. In such a scenario, initially, the Nifty may be expected to consolidate inside the range of 15,707 and 15,380, the market expert feels. And in case Nifty manages to get past 15,700, then the pullback swing shall expand into the critical resistance zone of 15,850 – 15,900 levels, the expert added. Contrary to this, weakness shall be confirmed if it closes below 15,380 levels, he feels. For the time being, it looks prudent to remain neutral on the index till stable signs are visible, the expert advised. The sentiments have gradually been improving especially after the market hit fresh 52-week low last week. Relative strength index (RSI) already moved from around 28 levels to 39.5 levels now on a week-on-week basis, while Stochastic gave a positive crossover on Thursday and overall has been trending upwards on a week-on-week basis. ""The daily RSI is in positive divergence. The trend is likely to remain positive in the near term with support at 15,400 and resistance at 15,600-15,800,"" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said. Options data suggested that the broader trading range for the Nifty50 could be between 15,000 to 16,000 levels. On the option front, we have seen a maximum Call open interest at 16,000 strike followed by 16,500 strike while there was maximum Put open interest at 15,500 strike followed by 15,000 strike. Call writing was seen at 16,000 strike then 15,700 strike while Put writing was seen at 15,300 strike then 15,600 strike. Bank Nifty also started off on a positive note at 32,927 and moved in a volatile manner with swift movement between 32,650 to 33,420 levels during the day. After a roller coaster ride, it settled at 33,135, up 290 points. The banking index formed a bullish candle on the daily frame with longer shadows indicating swings throughout the day. Now, it has to hold above the 33,000 mark to show an up move towards 33,333 and 33,500 levels whereas supports are placed at 32,750 and 32,500 levels, Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. On the stocks' front, Taparia said there was a positive setup in Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Coforge, M&M, Ashok Leyland, Jubilant Foodworks, Indian Hotels, TVS Motor Company, Tata Motors, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Pidilite Industries, TCS and Shriram Transport Finance; however, Manappuram Finance, Reliance Industries, Vedanta, Coal India, Bandhan Bank, and Marico witnessed weakness.

20,Indian economy to grow by 7-7.8% in FY23 despite global headwinds: Experts,business," The Indian economy can grow by 7-7.8 per cent this fiscal on the back of better agriculture production and a revitalised rural economy amid global headwinds mainly due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, eminent economists said. Eminent economist and BR Ambedkar School of Economics (BASE) Vice-Chancellor NR Bhanumurthy said at present Indian economy is facing multiple headwinds largely from external sources. Noting that global inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine war have brought in risks to the economy, which is otherwise strong with all the domestic macro fundamentals being well managed, he said unlike advanced economies, India's Covid stimulus measures, especially the fiscal policy interventions, are less inflationary and rather growth-enhancing. ""With better agricultural production and revitalised rural economy India should touch 7 per cent growth in the current year despite global headwinds,"" Bhanumurthy told PTI. Echoing similar views, eminent economist and Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID) director Nagesh Kumar said the high-frequency indicators point to a robust growth momentum carrying through 2022-23 with a real GDP growth somewhere between 7-7.8 per cent. French economist Guy Sorman said India could be severely impacted by the high cost of energy and fertiliser imports. ""However, because India is still, largely an agricultural economy, the social impact of slower growth will be tempered by city workers going back to their village. ""This could increase agricultural production and grain exports,"" Sorman added. The World Bank has cut India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.5 per cent as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions taper recovery. India's economy grew 8.7 per cent in the last fiscal (2021-22) against a 6.6 per cent contraction in the previous year. In its third monetary policy of 2022-23, the Reserve Bank retained its GDP growth forecast at 7.2 per cent for the current fiscal, but cautioned against negative spillovers of geopolitical tensions and a slowdown in the global economy. On high inflation, Bhanumurthy said, CPI inflation peaked in March 2022 and a large part of the CPI inflation in the last three months is driven by fuel prices. ""Delayed transmission of domestic fuel prices and rise in global fuel and other commodity prices appears to have led to a sudden spurt in CPI inflation,"" he said, adding that recent policy measures, such as reduction in fuel taxes and hike in policy interest rates, should smoothen inflation and inflation expectations in the coming quarters. Kumar noted that the global headwinds of rising commodity prices do pose downside risks for the Indian economic outlook as the CPI levels are elevated. ""Yet, I do not think that India is heading towards stagflation, given that the growth momentum seems quite robust,"" Kumar argued. According to Sorman, inflation has become a global phenomenon, caused by unanimous poor money management, an excess of public expenses (largely justified to compensate for Covid-19), and low-interest rates. ""The monetary bubble is exploding everywhere. India is not different,"" he pointed out. Retail inflation eased to 7.04 per cent in May, mainly on account of softening food and fuel prices as the government and the RBI stepped in to control spiralling price rise by way of duty cuts and repo rate hikes. However, the inflation print stayed above the Reserve Bank's upper tolerance level of 6 per cent for the fifth month in a row. Asked whether India's economy is in a better place than eight years ago, Sorman said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was selected to fight public corruption and stimulate the Indian economy. ""Modi has, partially, of course, fulfilled his agenda. Most Indians are better off today than they were eight years ago,"" he said."

After a flat start, the market gained the upside momentum as the day progressed. However, selling in the afternoon session erased the intraday losses, but buying in Auto, Information Technology, Pharma, and Realty names helped the market to close in the green. ""Indian markets opened on a positive note following Asian market peers which were trading mostly green led by China. During the afternoon session, markets trimmed some of their gains as European markets struggled to shrug off recession fears but managed to trade in the green,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. ""Buying in frontline stocks such as Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, and Bharti Airtel were aiding sentiment, while selling in Power Grid, Titan Co and NTPC kept the gains in the markets in check."" ""Traders were encouraged as Prime Minister Modi said the government expects the Indian economy to grow by 7.5% this year. Additional support came with RBI data showing that the country's foreign exchange reserves in nominal terms, including valuation effects, rose by $30.3 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal against a $99.2 billion expansion in FY2020-21,"" Solanki added.

Outlook for June 24 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities: Nifty ended higher after a volatile trading session on the day of weekly expiry. On the daily chart, the Nifty registered a strong comeback after a day of decline in the previous session. The daily RSI is in positive divergence. The trend is likely to remain positive in the near term. Support on the lower end is placed at 15,400; a close below 15,400 may induce the resumption of a market sell-off. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 15,600/15,800. Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Research- Derivatives at Kotak Securities The Nifty trend remains weak with resistance seen at 15,870 - unless the same is crossed expect weakness to continue. Short-term volatility continues to remain high. Broadly, expect pressure to continue while limited stock-specific risk definable opportunities are available. Select Auto, banking, and Midcap energy stocks look attractive from a risk perspective. Expect continuous selling pressure in the Metals space. Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities: Markets witnessed a roller coaster ride till mid-session before rebounding to comfortably settle in positive territory at close on hectic buying activity in IT, automobile & realty stocks. The fall in the crude oil prices gave some respite to the market, although concerns of persistent FII selling and rising bond yields in the US will continue to keep traders on the edge. Technically, for the last three days, the market has been witnessing non-directional activity. For Nifty, 15,400 and 15,600 are the important levels to watch out and below the same, the index could slip up to 15,340-15,300. On the flip side, 15,600 would be the key breakout level for the bulls. Above which, the index is likely to hit the level of 15,720-15,800. Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty has stepped into a short-term consolidation mode recently & accordingly it is witnessing range-bound action. The index witnessed sharp swings from 15,400-15,600 on June 23. On the higher side, 15,670-15,700, which was earlier acting as a support zone, is now posing as a resistance zone as per the principle of role reversal. The Nifty is facing selling pressure as it is approaching this area. Unless the level of 15,700 gets taken out on a closing basis, the index is expected to stay in a consolidation mode. On the downside, 15,400-15,360 is the near-term support zone, below which the index can test the recent low near 15,183."

0,"Auto stocks shrug weak sentiment, remain outliers since March lows",business," Auto stocks have been on an upward trajectory since March lows despite two intermittent corrections, even when the benchmark indices are getting serious threats from bears. In March 2022, the headline indices hit a one-year low as well as the lowest level since July 2021. And, last week too, both the Sensex and Nifty hit their fresh 52-week lows, tracking weakness in the global counterparts given the faster policy tightening by the Fed and other central banks amid elevated inflation figures. This suggests that the domestic equities have fallen way below the March 2022 low, though there was a bit of recovery later led by short covering in most beaten-down stocks. ""Markets are already pricing in a lot of bad news and outcomes. There is consensus that inflation will continue to be sticky, interest rates will rise, the US dollar will continue to strengthen, the oil will get to $150 a barrel and Ukraine situation will not get resolved in a hurry,"" Abhay Agarwal, Founder and Fund Manager at Piper Serica said. A very high probability of recession and stagflation has now been built into the models, the expert feels. Therefore, any positive surprise can provide a sharp turnaround to the market since there is a lot of under-ownership with cash sitting on the sidelines, Agarwal said. But Auto index turned out to be the biggest outlier since March lows, even when the global mood has been gloomy. Also read - Moneycontrol Market Sentiment Survey | Fund managers buying largecaps stocks in downturn, prefer banks most If we go by the data points, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 14 percent between March 8 and June 22, 2022, whereas in the same period, the Nifty50 index declined nearly 4 percent. Among individual stocks, Mahindra & Mahindra rallied 40 percent during the window while TVS Motor rose 39 percent. Ashok Leyland has gained 34 percent and Eicher Motors 18 percent. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, and Balkrishna Industries gained 10-14 percent. However, three scrips - Amara Raja Batteries, Bosch, and Exide Industries have been losers among the 15-share Auto index. Even on June 23, the Nifty Auto index climbed 3.7 percent at the time of writing this report, as Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, M&M, Tata Motors, and TVS Motor Company gained 3-6 percent. In fact, every stock in the sector was in the positive territory. Even in the last two downcycles, especially after hitting March lows, the index has not seen a similar kind of correction as witnessed by the Nifty50. Also read - IT will continue to receive tailwinds from strong deal activity and digital transformation After March lows, Nifty50 dropped 13 percent from April 4 till May 12 and 9.6 percent during June 3-June 20. In the same period, the Auto index declined 6.6 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. One reason behind the recovery in the Auto space could be a fall in metal prices and supply chains seem to be gradually normalising. Steel is the main material for the automobile industry. ""Autos is another space that will benefit as steel prices cool off and supply chains for key components come back. The domestic demand is robust and a good monsoon will support rural demand, especially for two-wheelers,"" said Abhay Agarwal. Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research also said the auto sector which was the laggard in the previous year is surging since March as the supply side as well as demand issues are getting resolved. ""Volumes are increasing and with the latest government move to reduce steel prices, margins are going to ease. We have added 2-wheelers in our portfolios last month and we also expect tractors and passenger vehicles to gain traction as the rural demand recovers,"" she added. The Nifty Metal index crashed 34 percent from its high of the current year at 6,826 levels on April 11, to 4,491 levels on June 22, following a correction in global metal prices. In fact, it was the biggest loser during the period, when Auto was flat and Nifty50 corrected nearly 13 percent."
1,Story in Charts | The rise of IPL to the world's second most valuable sports league,business," After the recently concluded media rights auction, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has now become the world's second most valuable sports league. Its rights value surpassed Rs 48,000 crore for the 2023-2027 cycle, making the 15-year-old IPL the fastest-growing sports league globally. From its staggering growth in media rights valuation to the windfall for IPL teams, Moneycontrol takes a look at the business of IPL in 12 charts. Viacom18 won the consolidated digital rights this year and Disney-owned Star the TV broadcast rights.  The media rights valuation for the 2023-2027 cycle grew more than two and a half times compared to the previous cycle. Digital saw the highest growth.  With $16 million per match value, IPL has vaulted past many global leagues.  Analysts expect revenues of IPL franchises to increase 2x in FY24 post the media rights auction and also due to the addition of more matches which will be 40% higher than the previous cycle.  Experts estimate that the net profit of IPL franchises is likely to increase from Rs 100-125 crore to Rs 270-300 crore thanks to increased media rights valuation.  Players' salaries are also expected to increase. The total salary purse is estimated to double from the current Rs 90 crore to Rs 180 crore.   From online gaming to edtech, new-age brands have come on board to partner with IPL franchises over the years. Analysts expect teams to see 15-20% growth in earnings from sponsorships this year.  Advertisers pay high premiums to feature during the league matches. The league's ad revenue has grown three-fold in the last five years.   Online gaming emerged as the top category during IPL 2022, up from its second place in IPL 2021. Fantasy sports company Dream11 was the top advertised brand during both IPL 2022 and 2021.  Franchises are expected to get a bigger cut in profits from the board as the central revenue pool will increase.  Just like media rights, the cost of owning an IPL franchise has also seen significant growth  In its 15-year journey, IPL has seen the highest ad spending changing from traditional categories like FMCG to digital-first brands like Dream11 and Swiggy."
2,"ASEAN should rethink its approach to Myanmar crisis, U.N. expert says",business," The Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN should rethink its approach to engaging with Myanmar and demand specific actions and timeframes to end hostilities in the military-ruled country, a United Nations expert said on Thursday. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, Tom Andrews, also called on U.N. member states to engage formally or informally with Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government (NUG) to help the humanitarian situation. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is divided over how to deal with Myanmar, where the military overthrew an elected government last year and has since led a brutal crackdown on opponents. Shortly after its coup, ASEAN members, including Myanmar, came to an agreement to restore peace, but progress has stalled amid weak enforcement. ""The (agreement) is meaningless if it sits on a piece of paper,"" Andrews told a news conference after a six-day trip to Malaysia, one of the junta's most vocal critics in the region. ""After one year of a lack of progress, let's rethink this approach by adding a strategy to the implementation of that approach,"" he said, adding ASEAN countries should heed Malaysia's call for more action. ASEAN late last year took the unusual step of excluding Myanmar's military leaders from a high-profile regional summit for failing to honour the peace deal. But current chair Cambodia has since made overtures to the junta, including inviting its defence minister to a regional meeting on Wednesday, despite criticism from activists. Countries are also divided over communicating with the NUG, an alliance of anti-junta groups in hiding or in self-imposed exile, which Andrews called a ""legitimate entity"". ""From a practical point of view… there's lots of information that (the NUG) has available, that could be of extremely valuable use for these countries seeking to give humanitarian aid,"" he said. The junta has outlawed the NUG for being ""terrorists"" and urged countries not to engage with them."

6,What’s good for India is good for HUL: Chairman Nitin Paranjpe at 89th AGM,business," Nitin Paranjpe, the chairman of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on June 23 outlined the company’s goals going forward in India and stressed on the need for equitable and inclusive growth in India that is both productivity and employment led. “HUL has been an integral part of India’s growth story over the years and has always believed that what is good for India is good for the company,” he said addressing the shareholders at HUL 89th Annual General Meet (AGM). This was Paranjpe’s first AGM after taking over as the chairman of the company. As its parent Unilever undergoes major restructuring, HUL in February separated the positions of chairman of the board and the CEO and managing director of the company and appointed Nitin Paranjpe as its non-executive chairman and non-executive director, effective March 31. The company’s erstwhile chairman Sanjiv Mehta continues to serve as the CEO and MD of the company. The India opportunity Paranjpe’s speech titled ‘serving India today and tomorrow’ addressed the challenges of inequality of wealth, and poverty and said the India growth story needs to be built by transforming rural India, accelerating the growth of medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), building strong infrastructure, creating a competitive edge in manufacturing, ensuring women’s participation in the workforce and deft management of the environment. “One of the biggest drivers will be the transformation of rural India. Today, nearly 60 percent of the country’s population depends on agriculture, and yet, agriculture and allied sectors only contribute about 19 percent to the country’s GDP,” Paranjpe said. According to the chairman, agriculture needs productivity-led growth, so that the sector can contribute significantly by improving output. “Hypothetically, we need to aim for 30 percent of those engaged in agriculture to produce what 60 percent or more do today.” Paranjpe also stressed that the country needs to ensure that there are ample employment opportunities in other sectors to phase people out of agriculture. The chairman similarly outlined the potential of MSMEs in driving further growth in India not only supplementing the country’s GDP, but by also providing for one of the highest employment to turnover ratios. He further lauded government initiatives to create India as a manufacturing hub and strengthening the infrastructure in the country. “Initiatives such as ‘Housing for All’, ‘Smart Cities Mission’; setting up of the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development and the Rs 100 lakh crore master plan for multi-modal connectivity are all steps in the right direction,” he added. However, he added, the country needs to address gender gap in the society to meet its full economic potential. “A McKinsey study estimates that India has the highest relative potential for additional GDP growth from achieving gender equality – as much as $700 billion. However, in the current scenario, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), India has one of the highest gender gaps with less than 20 percent women participation in the labour force. We have a long way to go to meet the global average of over 45 percent,” Paranjpe said addressing the shareholders. Maintaining ecological balance and next generation policy reforms like GST and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code were other important measures shared by Paranjpe to drive growth in the country. HUL’s gameplan for India Paranjpe said HUL will continue on its mission to serve India going ahead as the company recognises that it is the role of business to not just create economic value but also to generate social value, and to do so in a sustainable way. “With more than 9 out of 10 Indian households using one or more of our brands, we realise that we have the power to impact the lives of our consumers,” he added. According to the chairman, through several initiatives, HUL has been addressing challenges like water scarcity, livelihood opportunities, employability, health and sanitation among others. The company will continue to serve India, however Paranjpe added, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic on the country. “For instance, people are now demanding products that not only deliver functional benefits but are also good for the planet and for people. Forecasters are predicting a new `green awakening’ and increased `climate literacy’ among consumers especially after the fragility of the planet was exposed during the pandemic,” he said. Paranjpe outlined the need to tap digital as well as the offline medium as consumers shop across channels. “Brands need to be present everywhere and communicate consistently to stay top of mind. But that’s not all. In a nation of paradoxes, critical to unlocking value is de-averaging – we will need to win in rural as well as urban, in mass as well as premium, in traditional as well as digital,” he added. As HUL tries to leverage the India opportunity, the company is striving to build an intelligent enterprise, focusing on environmental sustainability build more resilient and equitable communities by raising living standards. He highlighted initiatives such Shikhar, the company’s B2B app which helps retailers track and place orders and now reaches over 8 lakh outlets and its tech-driven Dapada manufacturing unit that became the first FMCG factory in India to join the World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network. Paranjpe also reaffirmed HUL’s resolve to achieve net-zero emissions for all its products from sourcing to point of sale by 2039. “We have eliminated CO emissions from 2 thermal energy in our operations by replacing coal with greener alternatives such as biomass and biodiesel. By 2030, we will move away from fossil fuel-derived chemicals in our cleaning and laundry products, unlocking new ways of reducing our carbon footprint,” he added. In conclusion, he said HUL will continue to serve its consumers by leveraging technology across the value chain while taking care of people and the planet."

North America and the European Union were the regions that reported maximum growth in exports from India in both monthly and cumulative terms, according to the data released by the Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC) of India on June 23. Engineering exports accounted for 25.14 percent of total merchandise exports of India in April-May 2022, up from 24.64 percent reported in the same period a year ago. Though India saw its engineering exports growing so far in the current fiscal, concerns still remain, said Mahesh Desai, chairman of EEPC India. “One of the biggest concerns is the Russia-Ukraine war that has severely hampered shipments to CIS nations and may have a ripple effect on the global economy.” Further, Desai viewed that the resurgence of COVID-19 and subsequent damage to business prospects in some industrial cities may also adversely impact the global trade scenario. “Rising oil and commodity prices have added to the uncertainty. A sharp depreciation of rupee, although can help exports, for the time being, continuous weakening may be damaging for the economy,” said Desai, adding that the signing of new free trade agreements with UAE and Australia and ongoing negotiations with a number of developed nations may help exports from India to rise. As per the data of EEPC India, 28 out of 34 engineering panels witnessed positive year-on-year growth in exports during April-May 2022 over the same period a year ago. In May 2022, the exports of iron and steel and its products saw a 16 percent growth to $2.63 billion, up from $ 2.26 billion a year ago. Exports of non-ferrous metals and products rose 21 percent year-on-year to $1.31 billion, while exports of industrial machinery jumped 33 percent to $ 1.58 billion ($ 1.19 billion) in May 2022."
9,"MPC members can start with near-term interest rate forecasts, says Jayanth Varma",business," Jayanth Varma, one of the three external members of the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has said the rate-setting panel's members should start taking the first steps to providing interest rates projections by initially giving their individual views on where they see the policy rate in the near-term. ""I believe it is possible to start with baby steps and proceed gradually towards the desired goal,"" Varma told Moneycontrol via e-mail. ""It is possible to start with projections only for the next quarter and slowly expand the horizon. It is possible to begin with broad ranges for the policy rate and then progressively refine the range. These are all matters of implementation detail. The important thing is to have a consensus on whether this is worth doing."" Varma's comments come after he was cited as saying in the minutes of the June 6-8 meeting, released on June 22, that the time was ""ripe"" for the committee's members to start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate. This, according to the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad professor, would help in stabilising long-term bond markets and anchor inflation expectations. The MPC increased the repo rate by 40 basis points in an unscheduled meeting on May 4 and by 50 basis points on June 8, leading to speculation over how many rate hikes will be announced to curb inflation. Economists expect the repo rate to be anywhere between 5.5 percent and 6 percent by the end of FY23. India's headline retail inflation rate was 7.04 percent in May, according to data released earlier this month. The rate has exceeded the medium-term target of 4 percent for 32 consecutive months. It was also the fifth month in a row that inflation was higher than the 6 percent upper limit of the 2-6 percent inflation mandate of the RBI. The central bank's latest forecasts suggest it will fail to meet its inflation mandate later this year. Fed's forecasts The most famous set of interest rate forecasts comes from the US Federal Reserve. These projections, popularly called the dot plot, detail the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' – voting and non-voting – assessment of the appropriate mid-point of the federal funds rate target range at the end of the current and upcoming couple of calendar years as well as in the longer run. The latest projections, released on June 15, showed the median forecast of FOMC members was that the federal funds rate target range would be 3.25-3.50 percent by the end of 2022. In March, the forecast was 1.75-2.00 percent. The US Federal Reserve's dot plot is a key monetary policy guide for financial markets, who often alter their expectations of future interest rate action after seeing changes in the dot plot. While the US central bank publishes these interest rate forecasts – along with those for GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation – four times a year, the RBI publishes only an inflation and growth forecast six times a year. However, the RBI's inflation forecasts have come under fire over the years – initially for being overestimates and more recently, underestimates. According to Abhiman Das, now a professor at Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad after spending over 20 years in the RBI's statistics department working closely on its inflation forecasts, the lack of independent examination of the central bank's analysis by the MPC's external members is a big worry. ""The external members right now come and sit at the RBI for two-three days,"" Abhiman Das told Moneycontrol last month. ""Whatever the RBI staff come and tell them becomes the projection. But who says that projection is right?"" According to Varma, ""a lot of preparation and hard work"" is needed from the RBI and the MPC members to come out with interest rate forecasts. ""The MPC statement does include fan charts of projected inflation and growth which provide information about both the expected path as well as the range of uncertainty. Individual members' views might reflect different nuances,"" Varma told Moneycontrol."
10,"Africa must end food, pharma import dependence, African Development Bank president says",business," Africa must wean itself off dependence on food and medicine imports, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) said, as the institution approved creation of a pharmaceutical tech foundation and began processing requests for food relief. Africa was hit hard by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as many countries are still struggling to rebound, they are facing rising inflation and food shortages aggravated by the war in Ukraine. ""Africa should not allow itself to be vulnerable in excessively depending on others, whether it is for vaccines or whether it is for food,"" AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina told Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Kigali. ""The fact is that when you are dependent on others, you are also very highly vulnerable to any shock of any kind."" The bank last month approved a $1.5 billion financing facility for emergency food production, with the aim of averting a looming food crisis. The funds are meant to help 20 million farmers produce 38 million tonnes of food. Adesina said the bank had already received requests from countries to draw on the fund. ""Once those things come to our board, they are swiftly reviewed and approved, and the money is out at the door,"" he said. Meanwhile, the AfDB's board this week approved the creation of a new Africa Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation. Adesina said the foundation would allow Africa to leverage intellectual property rights, protected technologies and innovations to expand Africa's pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing sectors. ""Africa imports 80% to 90% of all its medicines for a population of 1.3 billion people. We cannot and we must not outsource the health security of Africa to the benevolence of others,"" he said. The World Trade Organization last week agreed on a partial waiver of intellectual property rights to allow developing countries to produce and export COVID-19 vaccines."
11,"'Sanctions are a double-edged sword': Xi's swipe at US, UK at BRICS Summit",business," Chinese President Xi Jinping took a swipe at US and European Union sanctions on Russia in the speech on Wednesday at the BRICS Summit, saying ""sanctions are a boomerang and a double-edged sword"". “Politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing the world economy using a dominant position in the global financial system to wantonly impose sanctions would only hurt others as well as hurting oneself, leaving people around the world suffering,” Xi told the BRICS Business Forum. Also Read: Xi warns about 'expanding military alliances' at BRICS summit: State Media Xi told the BRICS business forum that the ""Ukraine crisis is...a wake-up call"" and warned against ""expanding military alliances and seeking one's own security at the expense of other countries' security"". China and India have strong military links with Russia and buy large amounts of its oil and gas. India is expected to counter an anticipated effort by Xi to use the summit to highlight his efforts to build an alternative to the US-led global order. Beijing is keen on expanding the BRICS grouping. Beijing is hosting the meeting of the influential club of BRICS emerging economies, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global population and nearly a quarter of the world's gross domestic product. Three of its members - China, India and South Africa - have abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations will meet next week in Germany to discuss how to proceed with sanctions against Russia. The BRICS summit takes place as Russian troops continue to pummel eastern Ukraine after invading the country four months ago. China and India have both ramped up crude oil imports from Russia, helping to offset losses from Western nations scaling back Russian energy purchases."

The investors included British International Investment (BII), the UK's development finance and impact investor formerly known as CDC group and Sony Innovation Fund along with existing investors Kalaari Capital and Picus Capital, WeRize said in a statement. The company will use the funds to accelerate growth — build new financial products for its customers, expand and improve the technology platform as well as onboard freelancers in more than 1,000 new towns it is set to enter, it said. With this round, the company has raised a total sum of USD 25.75 million, it said."
13,"Investment through participatory notes declines to Rs 86,706 crore in May",business," Investment in the Indian capital markets through participatory notes (P-notes) dropped to Rs 86,706 crore till May-end from the preceding month, while experts say foreign investors will reverse their selling stance and return to the country's equities in the coming 1-2 quarters. P-notes are issued by registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to overseas investors who wish to be a part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly. They, however, need to go through a due diligence process. According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) data, the value of P-note investments in Indian markets -- equity, debt, and hybrid securities -- stood at Rs 86,706 crore at May-end compared to Rs 90,580 crore at April-end. In March, the investment was at Rs 87,979 crore. It was Rs 89,143 crore in February and Rs 87,989 crore in January. Of the total Rs 86,706 crore invested through the route till May 2022, Rs 77,402 crore was invested in equities, Rs 9,209 crore in debt, and Rs 101 crore in hybrid securities. In comparison, Rs 81,571 crore was invested in equities and Rs 8,889 crore in debt during April. ""In terms of ODI (offshore derivative instruments) in equity and debt, we have reached back to the levels of December 2020. ""However, if we look forward from here, most of the pain is factored in with the increase in 10-year bond yields, and equity markets showing significant drawdown,"" said Divam Sharma, founder at Green Portfolio, a portfolio management service provider. There is still an uncertainty around inflation levels and the US Federal Bank's actions. Besides, currency correction has happened to a large extent. ""Equity markets are offering some attractive valuations at these levels and the supply chain, and inflation issues should begin to subside over the coming months. Markets usually move ahead of the economic cycle and we believe that over the coming 1-2 quarters, we should see FPIs coming back to allocating capital towards Indian equities,"" he added. In line with decline in P-notes investment, the assets under the custody of FPIs dropped by 5 per cent Rs 48.23 lakh crore at May-end from Rs 50.74 lakh crore at April-end. Sharma attributed a large part of this reduction to the market correction in equity and debt portfolios. Meanwhile, foreign investors withdrew nearly Rs 40,000 crore from Indian equities and Rs 5,505 crore from the debt markets last month on fears of an aggressive rate hike by the US Fed that haunted such investors and dented sentiments."
14,Fall in onshore forward premiums could push India rupee even lower,business," A shortage of cash dollars and forward market intervention by the Reserve Bank of India which has pushed onshore 1-year forward premiums to their lowest levels in more than a decade could pressure the rupee to new lows, traders and analysts said. The one-year annualised forward premium stood at 2.91% at 0830 GMT, compared to its close of 2.82% on Wednesday. It had touched a low of 2.80% in the previous session, its lowest level since Nov. 25, 2011. ""The situation is really bad. There is dollar scarcity which is getting compounded by RBI taking delivery of maturing forward contracts,"" the head of forex trading at a private bank said. On Wednesday, the rupee touched a record low of 78.39 against the dollar despite a sharp fall in global crude oil prices, pushing forward premiums down. The rupee was trading at 78.34/35 on Thursday. The smaller forward premia is likely to make carry trades less attractive for overseas investors and an unwinding of these carry trades would put further downward pressure on the spot rupee, pushing it towards 79-80 levels, traders warned. Premia could fall further and some form of sell/buy swap window may be needed if the situation remains as grim, the trader said. ""RBI is doing a lot of buy/sell swaps to prevent showing a fall in spot foreign exchange reserves I guess. This is amplifying the signal from the interest rate spread between India and the U.S.,"" said Vivek Kumar, economist at QuantEco Research. The RBI until last year was buying forward dollars to prevent an infusion of rupee liquidity into the spot market when it intervened to curb excessive appreciation in the rupee. ""Persistent FPI outflows amid a wide trade deficit could also be creating a dollar shortage problem,"" Kumar said, referring to foreign portfolio investment. India's foreign exchange reserves fell to $596.46 billion as of June 10 from $601.06 billion a week earlier. ""A bit of dollar funding stress is evident globally as well, as is seen in the LIBOR-OIS spread and widening cross-currency swaps. However, RBI forward intervention has made it more acute in India's case,"" IFA Global Research said in a note. A shortage of cash dollars could become self-perpetuating like during the 2008 crisis if importers start hedging aggressively and could put spot rupee levels under pressure, Kumar said."
15,Titan's women ethnic wear brand Taneira eyes Rs 300 crore revenue  in FY23,business," Titan Company’s women ethnic wear brand Taneira eyes about two-fold growth in revenue at Rs 300 crore in current fiscal year, and Rs 1,000 crore by FY27. Launched in 2017, Taneira is the latest in-house brand from Titan. It aims to tap the huge ethnic apparel segment. The brand will predominantly focus on the saree business which is a Rs 50,000 crore market growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6-8 per cent, a top company official said. ”We are small right now and are recovering from the Covid impact. We have great expansion plans going forward. In the current fiscal we expect revenue of about Rs 250-300 crore but our ambition is to make Taneira a Rs 1,000 crore brand by FY27,” Taneira Chief Executive Officer Ambuj Narayan told PTI. The company has 25 stores across Delhi, Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru , Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Jamshedpur, Vadodara, Lucknow and Kolkata. ”We are in process to increase the number to 50-60 stores by this year and over the next 3-4 years it will be further ramped up to 125 Taneira retail stores chain that will cover the majority of tier-I and tier-II cities. Now, we will focus more on franchisee stores. Currently, half of the retail stores are company-owned,” Narayan said. He said in future the company is planning to open overseas stores in markets having Indian diaspora like the US. The brand stores emphasize on Indian diverse textiles and workmanship under one roof for the finest and unique handcrafted ethnic wears like sarees, kurtas and other apparels.

16,Bridgewater doubles bet against European stocks to $10.5 billion,business," Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has built a $10.5 billion bet against European companies, almost doubling its wager in the past week to its most bearish stance against the region’s stocks in two years. The world’s biggest hedge fund firm disclosed short bets against 28 companies that include individual wagers of more than $500 million against ASML Holding NV, TotalEnergies SE, Sanofi and SAP SE, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total bet is up from $5.7 billion against 18 firms last week, the data shows. Short sellers try to profit from declining stock prices by selling borrowed shares and buying them back when they fall. They are mounting their bets at a time of rising interest rates and inflation that are increasing the chances of recession. It’s not clear whether Bridgewater’s bets are aimed at pure profit or part of a broader hedging strategy. In a Bloomberg TV interview last week, Greg Jensen, the co-chief investment officer of the firm, said the sell-off in stocks was still small as compared to the rally they had seen over the last decade and that bigger moves in Europe and the US was still possible. He declined to comment on Bridgewater’s European bets. The current wagers are the highest since the firm built a $14 billion position against European companies in 2020 and before that, a $22 billion bet in 2018. The total may be even greater since hedge funds are only required to disclose their biggest bets."

18,Rebel Shiv Sena MLA writes to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray; says Eknath Shinde went against leadership for rights of party legislators,business," Rebel Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsat has written a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, claiming that state minister Eknath Shinde took the step of going against the party leadership as Sena MLAs, who faced ""humilitation"" for the last two-and-a-half years, persuaded him to do so. Shirsat, the MLA from Aurangabad (West) Assembly constituency, in a letter dated June 22, claimed that despite the Shiv Sena being in power and having its own chief minister, the coterie around Thackeray never allowed them access to 'Varsha', the CM's official residence. There was no question of going to 'Mantralaya', the state secretariat, because the chief minister never came there, he said. The letter was posted by Shinde on his Twitter handle, claiming these were the sentiments of the Sena MLAs. Shinde is currently camping with some rebel MLAs in Assam's Guwahati city, plunging the Sena-led Maharashtra government into a crisis. In the letter, Shirsat said Eknath Shinde opened doors for the party MLAs to hear their grievances, issues about development work in their constituencies and related fund, and problems with allies Congress and NCP. ''Only Shinde heard us out and took steps to resolve all the problems. The party MLAs persuaded Shinde to take this step (or revolt) for the rights of all the legislators,"" Shirsat said in the letter. While the Shiv Sena legislators had no access to the chief minister, the Congress and NCP, which are the ""real opponents"" of the Shiv Sena, were getting all the attention, he claimed. Shirsat also said the party MLAs were not allowed to accompany Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray (the CM's son) to Ayodhya (during his recent visit). ''The Shiv Sena votes did not split in the Rajya Sabha polls, then why so much distrust in us for the Legislative Council polls?"" he asked."

The International Energy Agency has warned that Europe must prepare immediately for the complete severance of Russian gas exports this winter, urging governments to take measures to cut demand and keep ageing nuclear power stations open.

Fatih Birol, the head of the IEA, said Russia’s decision to reduce gas supplies to European countries in the past week may be a precursor to further cuts as Moscow looks to gain “leverage” during its war with Ukraine.

20,Wire Network launches unique crypto interoperability protocol,business," Wire Network has launched an interoperability protocol that gives users access to a universal, readable wallet address to send and receive non-fungible tokens as well as perform cryptocurrency swaps across any blockchain. The Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (UPAP) is a blockchain technology that leads a line-up of innovations focused on usability, gaming, scalability, and security for cryptocurrencies and decentralised applications (dapps). “While other competitors have attempted interoperability, they are limited by complex procedures, vulnerable blockchain bridges… or centralised operations,” said Ken DiCross, CEO of Wire Network. “The UPAP protocol is fully decentralised… and offers low-fee service that is more secure from cyberattacks.” DiCross said he expects every major chain, wallet and user to adopt the protocol. Alpha versions of the universal wallet are currently accessible through Wire’s NFT marketplace and play-to-earn dapp, R4R3, and Dragon Spawn. It will soon be available broadly via UPAP-enabled wallet partners TheWallet and MegaMask. Developers will be able to provide users with UPAP functionality in their wallets. Once a digital asset is held by a UPAP wallet holder and has entered its ecosystem, it becomes interoperable and enables users to trade assets without paying the transaction fees of the native chain. The UPAP wallet integrates with any blockchain and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Wax and Algorand, among others. A user only has to import a mnemonic code from a wallet to render a universal wallet address, unlocking all protocols representing any blockchain."
21,Chaayos raises $53 million for business expansion,business," Tea cafe chain Chaayos on Thursday said it has raised USD 53 million (around Rs 414 crore) for tech-enhancement, hiring and store expansion as it plans to add 100 stores by the end of this year. The company said the funding round was led by Alpha Wave Ventures with participation from all existing investors -- Elevation Capital, Tiger Global and Think Investments.

At Chaayos, guests can personalize their fresh cup of 'chai' in 80,000 combinations and Chaayos IoT-enabled tea bots called Chai Monks, make this possible. It said the company's facial recognition software enables faster checkouts and payments. The latest capital raise will help us deepen our technology investments to further enhance our guest experience and build a ubiquitous brand that is an integral part of the Indian society over decades to come. ""Like always, we will continue to grow our cafe footprint and go deeper into the cities we are present in and explore new markets. We are also continuously on the lookout to hire talent to handle the scale that we aspire for,"" Saluja said."
22,IPO-bound Pine Labs acquires fintech infra startup Setu for $70-75 million,business," Merchant payments and lending platform Pine Labs has acquired fintech infrastructure specialist Setu for $70-75 million to strengthen its diversified online payments and lending offerings ahead of its plans to list in the United States, the company said on June 23. ​Founded in 2018 by Nikhil Kumar and Sahil Kini, Setu offers API (application programme interface) integration for fintech players to work closely with regulated entities like banks, NBFCs and others. Setu's founders will continue to lead the company and brand name and will function independently, the founders said in an address to the media. Sahil Kini, co-founder and CEO of Setu said, ""As part of this acquisition, Setu will retain its brand identity, business, team and customers. We will get to grow further with access to Pine Labs' large merchant network."" Setu offers open APIs across four categories—data, payments, investments and lending.​ For Pine Labs, the company's offerings including the interface for Account Aggregator (AA) and plans to grow in the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) space and Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) framework made Setu an attractive bet. Commenting on the acquisition, B Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs said, ""I am looking at this acquisition as a completion between an online payment stack and an embedded fintech stack. Both those coming together make it extremely powerful."" ""The engineering, product development, ecosystem building, will continue to remain independent. We see a lot of synergy from a distribution standpoint,"" Rau added. Rau did not comment on the company's timeline for its US listing. Over the past year, Pine Labs has adopted an omnichannel approach and is expanding its geographical presence. The company’s core payment offering is point of sale (PoS) machines for offline payments, but the firm also forayed into online payments with the launch of its payment gateway platform Plural in October 2021. Pine Labs is also expanding its Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) offering in Southeast Asia and it entered the consumer payments space with the acquisition of Fave in April 2021. Rau said that the offline PoS business now contributes less than 40 percent to the company's revenues while the rest comes from new businesses. The company's payment gateway Plural is expected to make the offline-to-online transition easier for Pine Labs’ merchant base and will help the company retain its merchants for online payments as well as the penetration of merchant digital payments continues to grow in India. Setu had powered an Equitas Small Finance Bank fixed deposit product on Google Pay last year which was later pulled down after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had raised questions on the product. Nandan Nilekani, Co-founder and Chairman of Infosys Technologies Limited said, ""I have seen both Sahil and Nikhil at close quarters earlier, at Aadhaar and UPI. The kind of infra Setu is building will be very important for India in the years to come."" Kini and Kumar were part of building Indiastack and the technology behind Aadhar and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). According to multiple sources, UPI leader PhonePe and rival API infra player M2P Fintech too were in talks to acquire Setu, however, the deals did not fructify. The company has raised a total of over $1.2 billion till date and is now valued at $5-5.5 billion. In 2022 alone, Pine Labs raised $220 million across three rounds from India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), Alpha Wave Global and United Kingdom investment firm Vitruvian Partners. The company acquired a majority stake in payment solution provider Mosambee at a valuation of $100 million and also acquired online payments start-up Qfix Infocomm in 2022."

0,MakeMyTrip to increase all-women team of holiday experts,business," Online travel firm MakeMyTrip on Thursday said it plans to increase its all-women team of ’holiday experts’ boosted by consistent growth delivered and highest-ever packages sold by them last fiscal. In FY22, the team of women freelancers, serving as holiday experts, helped curate packages for nearly two lakh travellers closing the year with highest-ever packages sold by these experts in over 10 years, MakeMyTrip said in a statement. ”Spurred by the consistent growth, in the coming months, MakeMyTrip is now aiming to expand the franchise network and increase its pool of holiday experts across the country,” it added. The company, however, did not elaborate by how much the number of its all-women team of holiday experts would be increased. Currently, MakeMyTrip said it has over 850 women holiday experts with 43 per cent of them being mothers and caregivers working from metros such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Indore, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh and Lucknow. MakeMyTrip said during the pandemic it saw a 200 per cent increase in interest from women freelancers in joining this team from these markets.  ”We take pride in our robust holiday expert program that includes women from all walks of life. It’s a platform that offers flexible work engagements, attractive conversion-based remuneration, and numerous opportunities for holistic growth,” MakeMyTrip Business Head, Holidays & Experiences, Jasmeet Singh said. The company was amongst the initial set of companies who realised the power of working from home, and started investing in a team of freelancers, he added. ”Our efforts to build a strong base of end-to-end holiday planning experts have been consistently delivering dividends in the form of rising contributions to the Holiday Packages segment. We are now keen on expanding our base of over 850 holiday experts and our franchise networks, as we target to penetrate deeper in this segment,” Singh said. The company said it offers benefits, including self and family insurance cover, access to upskilling and development courses, team bonding and engagement opportunities and travel perks to its holiday experts. ”Their trust in us as a brand bolstered during the pandemic as we remained committed to our promise of taking care of the team. During this period, we continued to remain invested in the team and leveraged their expertise for building cause-related and pandemic-focused assets, beyond travel packages,” Singh said."
1,Clouds over steel stocks have darkened,business," Iron ore prices are sending a signal that distress may lie ahead for the steel sector. The industry outlook had already dulled in 2022 due to a series of setbacks, including rising energy costs, China’s real estate slowdown, the Russia-Ukraine war’s impact on demand and central banks hitting the brakes on easy monetary policy, a course correction that will slow the world economy.
But all of this was already known. In fact, in India, matters had turned worse after the government imposed..."
2,Here’s how to claim health insurance from your office cover and personal cover at the same time,business," One of the biggest mistakes a salaried employee makes is to depend solely on office-provided health insurance. We, at Moneycontrol, have repeatedly pointed out that you must have your own personal health insurance as well. A sudden job loss or even a job change might result in your insurance cover vanishing overnight if the new employer doesn’t offer a comprehensive cover, or worse, no cover at all. Then again, there are lots of questions surrounding your office-provided cover as well. Does the corporate health insurance plan cover your parents? How do you submit a claim under a corporate health insurance policy? Can your employer customise the group health insurance cover? In a new series at Moneycontrol, we aim to demystify the corporate health plans and help you make the most of your group health insurance plan. To begin with, keep in mind that in addition to your corporate policy, it’s just as important for you to have your own health insurance policy.  It is not uncommon for policyholders to have multiple health insurance policies to ensure good coverage of their family’s health and well-being. So, when the need arises, how are they to split a claim for the same hospitalisation between multiple insurance policies? Hospital costs are increasing at a rapid rate. Medical inflation is considered to be growing at a faster rate than general inflation. In such a scenario, it is increasingly common for individuals to exhaust their policy limits. A thorough approach to filing a claim can ensure that out of pocket expenses are minimised. Also read: Why you need additional health insurance  despite having a company cover  in place Cashless or reimbursement: How to file a claim Claim settlement can either be in a cashless mode or could be filed for reimbursement. Cashless is an easier and faster process. Under this, you would need to approach the insurance helpdesk at the hospital and show your health e-card. The hospital and insurer coordinate directly to settle bills up to your policy limit. To avail of a cashless claim, the treating hospital should be registered as a network hospital with the insurer. Reimbursement, as the name implies, requires you to pay first and get the amount reimbursed later. For hospitals that are not part of the network, reimbursement is the only mode for claim settlement. You would have to submit all bills, receipts and medical papers to the insurer, who then verifies them and reimburses the amount to your bank account.  Splitting claims with multiple policies The most common reason for splitting claims between two policies is the exhaustion of the sum assured or policy limit. Once the limit is exhausted in one of the policies, you can file for the residual amount in the other policy. Let’s look at some scenarios and the recommended method, depending on whether the treating hospital is part of the network. Also read: Have more than one health cover? Here’s how you must file claims Scenario 1: Hospital is part of the network of Insurer 1 but not of Insurer 2 You should file for a cashless claim with Insurer 1. Insurer 1 will settle the claim, up to the policy limit, directly with the hospital. You will have to pay the residual amount out of your own pocket. The hospital will give you a receipt for that residual amount, a copy of all bills and treatment papers and a claim settlement letter. While still hospitalised, register the claim with Insurer 2. After getting discharged, you need to share the above papers with Insurer 2. After review, the residual amount, up to the policy limit, will be credited into your bank account. Scenario 2: The hospital is part of the network of both insurers 1 and 2 Generally, it is not possible to go cashless with both insurers in such a scenario. So, you would have to choose one of the insurers for the cashless option. Typically, insurers have a negotiated package rate with hospitals. In case the treatment is not part of the package, it is classified as open billing. In such cases, the insurer negotiates a discount on key expenses e.g., room rent. Opt for the insurer with a lower cost package. This will help you minimise your out-of-pocket expenses and overall billing. Once a cashless claim is processed by the chosen insurer, repeat the same for the reimbursement process with the other Insurer, as specified above. Scenario 3: Neither hospital is part of the network In such a case, you should inquire about the claim settlement turnaround time (TAT) of both insurers. Also, ascertain which insurer would return the documents to you quickly after the claim is processed. Prefer the faster insurer for the first reimbursement. After the initial claim is settled, get back all stamped copies of the claim papers along with the claim settlement letter. You can submit this to Insurer 2 for reimbursement of the residual amount. If you are splitting your claims, keep a note of this: Time limit on a reimbursement claim: There is a time limit to file a reimbursement claim. So register your claim during your hospitalisation itself and ensure that you submit all relevant documents immediately after discharge. Sometimes, insurers want to verify a hospitalization. Registering a claim while being hospitalised enables the insurer to conduct such a verification, if it chooses to do so. Policy limits: Some treatments in the policy may have a sublimit e.g., maternity. Opt for the insurer with the higher limit to avail of a cashless claim. Hospital package rates and policy sub-limits: In case a hospital is on the network of both insurers, go with the insurer that has a lower package rate (that is, rates negotiated and agreed upon by insurers and hospitals) with the hospital, irrespective of the policy limit. Let us consider a scenario where insurer 1 has a package of ₹80,000 and insurer 2 has a package of ₹1 lakh. Assuming a policy sub-limit (internal ceilings linked to room rent or procedure-specific within the overall sum assured) of ₹50,000 and ₹60,000, respectively, if you opt for a cashless claim from Insurer 2, your residual amount would be ₹40,000. So, it is likely that insurer 1 would not settle claims more than ₹20,000. However, if you choose Insurer 1 for cashless, your residual amount would be ₹30,000 and Insurer 2 is likely to settle the full amount."

5,Poaching and coaching in Kota: Race for $500 million education hub heats up,business," Hemant Kumar Bhadoriya (name changed) was travelling in a chauffeur-driven sports utility vehicle on a Saturday afternoon in Kota, seemingly headed to Jaipur, where people typically go on weekend getaways. Unlike the others, though, Bhadoriya was not out on a leisure drive. Neither was he actually going to Jaipur. He was, in fact, just sitting in the car and talking about money. Crores of rupees. Bhadoriya is not a lawyer or an investment banker. Neither does he deal in illegal activities. He is a maths teacher at Kota’s top coaching centre and was negotiating with a potential employer, one of the country’s biggest edtech companies. The edtech startup had offered him a 40 percent hike on his existing salary of Rs 1.65 crore. “At first, I was shocked and a bit sceptical when I heard about the offer as every day we have been reading about how hundreds of employees were getting laid off by startups,” said Bhadoriya, 46. “But then it was for their offline classes and I have been teaching all my life at offline classes here at Kota. So I said let’s take a chance. To be honest, the hike I was offered was very attractive.” Bhadoriya’s story rings a bell with many educators from Kota who have been offered hefty hikes over the past few months by new-age edtech companies that have opened offline coaching centres in the city. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. The aggressive poaching at Kota for offline classes is taking place as online edtech companies lay off hundreds of educators elsewhere in the country, indicating that demand for offline education is rising again, especially in education hubs like Kota. Everyone loves Kota Kota, a city with a population of over 1 million in eastern Rajasthan about 500 km south of New Delhi, is known for tuition centres notoriously called ‘coaching factories’ that churn out hundreds of successful aspirants for the Indian Institutes of Technology every year. These education centres provide direct or indirect livelihood to over 200,000 people in the city. Kota has about 3,500 hostels and 22,000 paying guest accommodation centres where students stay, according to people from the city who spoke to Moneycontrol. The story of Kota was intriguing enough to entice Netflix in 2019, just before the pandemic, to do a show that captures the ‘24/7 pressure cooker situation’ of the city. One of the show’s producers described Kota as a city where the people talk only about studies. “Kota’s economics and emotions are only about studies,” said Shreyash Pandey, associate producer of the show called Kota Factory. It all started in the mid-1980s, when engineers of Kota started their own tuition centres. Subsequently, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a few students cleared the IIT entrance examinations, which motivated many educators to expand their coaching classes. The Bansals of Bansal Classes and the Maheshwaris of Allen Career Institute were among the first to broaden the scope of their coaching centres. Moneycontrol reported how the four Maheshwari brothers built Allen Career Institute from a grand total of eight students studying at their home 34 years ago to an institution that has hundreds of IITians on its rolls. The company recently raised $600 million (about Rs 4,500 crore) from James Murdoch's Bodhi Tree Systems, and also made forays into online teaching. According to a report by India Today, the turning point for Kota’s coaching classes was when the first student from the city cleared the IIT entrance exam in 1985. Many educators who taught at these coaching institutes then started their own tuition centres. In the following years, the coaching centres went on to do crores of rupees of business and the city started creating opportunities for educators worth millions of dollars. On an average, a student in Kota pays up to Rs 2.5 lakh a year. About 150,000 students are admitted to the Kota coaching centres annually. Going by these estiamates, the coaching centers of Kota have a market size of as much as $500 million or about Rs 3,800 crore. Kota’s tuition centres were among the first in the country to set up special arrangements for IIT aspirants, tying up with local secondary schools for class 12 board exams. The students were told to concentrate more on the IIT entrance exam and not to worry about attending class 12 lectures. The model was then adopted by many coaching institutes in the country. The pandemic The pandemic changed everything for Kota. The city that once bustled with young IIT and medical college aspirants now had empty streets. Educators, coaching centre owners, and students, among others, were staring at absolute uncertainty after the government announced a nationwide lockdown in March 2020 to curb the spread of COVID-19. “Right from small eateries to paying guest accommodation centres, it felt as though everyone was jobless suddenly. The coaching institutes, which were full of thousands of students, were looking like graveyards and we really didn’t know what to do next,” said an educator working with the management of a top institute in Kota. “We had thousands, maybe lakhs, of livelihoods at stake and the shift to online education was looking real.” All the coaching institutes scrambled to find solutions. “But everyone knew that once the pandemic receded, the people would come back to offline education and Kota would again become hot as it has always been because of the weather and the competition,” the educator added. The educator has a point. Kota seems to have become ‘hot’ again because of competition. But this time, the competition between education companies is more fierce than the rivalry among students as edtech startups aggressively look to poach educators like Bhadoriya. “Coaching centres have become more like poaching centres,” said another educator based in Kota, requesting anonymity. “And not just teachers, even students are being poached by offering them more lectures and content for cheaper packages. This has just started. We will see the edtech companies and the traditional coaching classes doing various things to attract students and educators.” The educator’s comments come after Unacademy and PhysicsWallah, two well-funded online education unicorns, opened physical tuition centres in Kota. While it is a shift in strategy for both companies that were built on the model of online teaching, they expect offline and hybrid models to help them grow faster. “For Unacademy, growth in the medical and IIT entrance exam preparation segment wouldn’t have been possible without going offline,” said one person familiar with the startup’s plans, requesting anonymity. “The team discussed it internally and thought making offline forays would be right at this time and Kota was the place to be for this as it is such an important hub for test preparations.” Market share fears The entry of the new-age edtech companies has threatened the dominance of incumbent coaching centres of Kota, which are concerned about losing market share. “What they (traditional coaching institutes) fear is that companies like Unacademy, which have millions of dollars in their bank, will disrupt Kota totally with cheaper packages, better educators and most importantly, with hundred times better tech infrastructure,” said a former professor of IIT who has taught in Kota. Most coaching centres in Kota conduct no-frills classes, offering nothing more than star educators to lure students. According to the educators Moneycontrol spoke to, the content provided in these classes is very good and comprehensive but it’s not digital. The pandemic made digital learning a habit for most and students may not be comfortable with books again, educators said. “I can just do a CTRL+F on digital content and go to the chapter that I am looking for,” said a student. “It just becomes easier to skim through it on a laptop or mobile instead of going through hundreds of pages. It also saves time.” Many coaching centres in the city also do not have biometric attendance, smart boards, projectors and other digital infrastructure facilities that edtech companies provide. One educator said students aged 14-17 find these things attractive and thus they may choose to go to these classes. “I genuinely believe that companies like PhysicsWallah and Unacademy will attract more students, at least in the near-term, simply because their classes will look a lot more ‘cooler’ and this was missing in Kota. Other coaching classes, which have money in the bank, might add these things, but it will take time because they have never done it,” the professor said. According to the professor, it won’t be easy for existing coaching centres to retain their market share. Allen vs Unacademy The fear of losing market share and the aggressive poaching have led to a full-blown rivalry between new-age edtech companies and incumbent coaching classes. One such rivalry is Allen vs Unacademy. Unacademy, which opened its first offline centre in Kota in mid-June, is looking to open another centre in the city and claims demand for its classes is strong. However, Unacademy’s journey in Kota hasn’t been smooth, according to people aware of the matter, who said it faced multiple issues, including direct and indirect threats allegedly from some people at Allen Career Institute after the SoftBank-backed unicorn poached 30-40 educators from Allen. Brajesh Maheshwari, one of the four founders of Allen, warned educators who left recently that they would be blacklisted. In an internal video shared with educators on June 10, Maheshwari said “Aaj se sharafat ki duniya khatam, jaisi duniya waise hum,” which translates to: from today, the world of decency ends, we will behave the way the world behaves. Brajesh Maheshwari's video warning educators. A day later, a few hours before the launch of Unacademy’s offline tuition centre in Kota, the startup sought police protection for its employees and educators who were paranoid about Maheshwari’s alleged threats, according to people aware of the matter. The educators especially were worried because of the reputation of the Maheshwaris. Rajesh Maheshwari, the oldest of the brothers, claimed in a YouTube video a few years ago to be the ‘don’ of the coaching industry. “If you wear an Unacademy t-shirt in Kota, you will see people following you,” said one person involved with Unacademy’s management team at Kota. “Obviously, there are no cases where someone actually hurt any of our educators. But the constant following, especially to hotels, restaurants and in some cases, to their houses, has created fear among the educators.” Virtual threats Some threats were virtual. The names of educators poached from Allen by Unacademy were made public via YouTube videos and some were circulated privately through messaging applications in Kota. The videos mentioned how in the past, teachers who left Allen couldn’t survive in Kota without Allen as Kota enjoyed a monopoly in the IIT entrance exam category. One video that went viral on YouTube had an anecdote about an educator who left Allen a few years ago to start his own centre in Kota and was supposedly killed by his landlord after failing to pay the rent. Allen's faculty left Allen and join Unacademy “These are all tactics to just remotely threaten educators as Allen is scared about losing its monopoly in Kota,” said another person working with Unacademy’s management in Kota. “But to be honest, we all are a bit concerned and we have taken steps to allay the fears of the educators and some of our employees.” According to this person, Unacademy opened bank accounts for its educators in nearby cities, and not in Kota, after many of them asked the company to do so amid alleged threats from Allen. Unacademy executives who visited Kota for the launch of the offline centre stayed at educators’ houses after they noticed they were being followed to their hotels. Allen then allegedly sent ‘bouncers’ near these educators’ houses. “Random people were roaming around educators’ houses suddenly and then someone complained about it on WhatsApp initially and then the police came,” said one person. Under pressure Many educators who decided to join Unacademy were made to wait for four-five hours during their exit interviews at Allen. They were then asked to call Unacademy and reject its offer, which also put pressure on them, the people claimed. Moreover, Allen’s ‘unofficial people’ were present at the hotel where Unacademy had scheduled educator recruitment interviews. “The same people were sitting in the same cafeteria every day where Unacademy was conducting interviews,” said one person. “Were they doing anything? No. But it was just a way of putting pressure on the educators to show them that Allen is watching them.” The person added that some negotiations with educators thus happened in cars on highways as educators were scared about people following them. On an average, Allen’s educators across streams get Rs 1.15 crore a year. Unacademy offered a 35-40 percent hike to the educators, according to people aware of the matter. Just before the official launch of Unacademy’s coaching centre, the company had scheduled an event for the educators to pose in Unacademy t-shirts. But the event, which was planned at a public ground, was cancelled because the educators were scared, according to one person. Unacademy executives who travelled to Kota for due diligence were also bothered by the local police, people aware of the matter alleged. Their cars were stopped and everything from their bags to the car tyres were checked by the police who said they had been tipped off about people carrying huge amounts of cash and certain illegal material. Allen declined to comment on the matter. Unacademy did not respond to an email query from Moneycontrol. Beyond Kota The focus on offline coaching centres isn’t limited to Kota. As the pandemic recedes, demand for online learning offered by startups has also eased, prompting their ventures into offline coaching. “It’s not only in Kota – there are at least four to five such hubs in India. And this is not the case with just Allen. Institutes at other hubs that enjoy a monopoly also do things like this,” a student from Kota told Moneycontrol. “Back in the day, these people used to threaten students by telling them that they won’t achieve a good rank, but the students started realising that wasn’t quite the case. That’s when they started going after the educators.” The fight for a larger share in the offline education space comes as demand for online and remote educational services is falling, thanks to the pandemic situation normalising in most parts of the country. Moneycontrol had reported how India’s edtech companies were struggling after the pandemic. To be sure, India’s online edtech companies had two consecutive years of hypergrowth since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Investors bet heavily on online education, which was in huge demand since the start of the pandemic, after millions of students were locked indoors. According to data from Tracxn Technologies, edtech companies in India received $9.5 billion in funding over the past two years, with six companies joining the coveted club of unicorns – startups valued at over $1 billion."
6,Russia crimps gas flows just as Europe races to stock up for winter,business," Germany’s largest storage chamber for natural gas stretches underneath a swath of farmland the size of nine soccer fields in the western part of the country. The bucolic area has become a kind of battlefield in Europe’s effort to defend itself against a looming gas crisis driven by Russia. Since last month, the German government has been rapidly pumping fuel into the vast underground site in Rehden, hoping to fill it in time for the winter, when demand for gas surges to heat homes and businesses. The scene is being repeated at storage facilities across the continent, in a jousting over energy between Europe and Russia that has been escalating since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The scene is being repeated at storage facilities across the continent, in a jousting over energy between Europe and Russia that has been escalating since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. In the latest sign that Moscow appears intent on punishing Europe for sanctions and military support for Ukraine, Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy giant, last week cut by 60 percent the amount of gas it delivers via Nord Stream 1, a critical pipeline serving Germany and other countries. It is not clear if the throttling is a precursor to a complete cutoff. In the latest sign that Moscow appears intent on punishing Europe for sanctions and military support for Ukraine, Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy giant, last week cut by 60 percent the amount of gas it delivers via Nord Stream 1, a critical pipeline serving Germany and other countries. It is not clear if the throttling is a precursor to a complete cutoff. The move has added urgency to efforts in Germany, in Italy and elsewhere to build up inventories of gas in a crucial effort to moderate stratospheric prices, reduce Moscow’s political leverage and head off the possibility of shortages this winter. Gazprom’s actions have also forced many countries to loosen their restrictions on power plants burning coal, a major source of greenhouse gases. “If the storage facilities are not filled by the end of summer, the markets will interpret that as a warning of price spikes or even energy shortages,” said Henning Gloystein, a director at Eurasia Group, a political risk firm. Gas prices are already extraordinarily high, about six times what they were a year ago. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, has warned that the persistently high energy costs were threatening to plunge Europe’s largest economy into an economic crisis, and the government has called on consumers and companies to conserve gas.

Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, has warned that the persistently high energy costs were threatening to plunge Europe’s largest economy into an economic crisis, and the government has called on consumers and companies to conserve gas. “There is a risk of a very serious economic crisis because of the sharp increase in energy prices, because of supply chain problems and because of inflation,” Mr. Lindner told ZDF public television on Tuesday. “There is a risk of a very serious economic crisis because of the sharp increase in energy prices, because of supply chain problems and because of inflation,” Mr. Lindner told ZDF public television on Tuesday. The stage was set for an energy crisis last year. A cold snap in late winter ate into gas reserves, and Gazprom stopped selling any supplies beyond its contractual obligations. Gazprom-owned storage facilities in Germany, including the massive underground chamber in Rehde, which the German government took control of in April, were allowed to dwindle down to nearly empty. To avoid a repeat of last year, and to safeguard against supply disruptions, the European Union agreed in May to require member states to fill their storage facilities to at least 80 percent of capacity by Nov. 1. So far, countries are making good progress toward this goal, with overall European storage levels at 55 percent. The giant facility in Rehden is more than 12 percent full, but Germany, Europe’s largest gas consumer, has reached an overall level of 58 percent — both well above the levels this time last year. Other big gas users, including France and Italy, have stores at similar levels, while Spain has more than 77 percent. But while storage levels are still edging up, Gazprom’s cutbacks put those targets in doubt and threaten a crunch next winter, analysts say. If Nord Stream was shut down completely, “Europe could run out of storage of gas in January,” said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president for gas research at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm. If Nord Stream was shut down completely, “Europe could run out of storage of gas in January,” said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president for gas research at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm. Gazprom has blamed the cutbacks on a pipeline part that was sent for repairs and hadn’t returned in time. But European leaders have flatly rejected this argument, and a Germany regulator said it saw no indication of how a mechanical issue could result in such decreases. Gazprom has blamed the cutbacks on a pipeline part that was sent for repairs and hadn’t returned in time. But European leaders have flatly rejected this argument, and a Germany regulator said it saw no indication of how a mechanical issue could result in such decreases. “The Russian side’s justification is simply a pretext,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, last week. “It is obviously the strategy to unsettle and drive up prices.” The gambit is succeeding. European gas futures have risen about 50 percent over the last week. The reduction in supplies to the German pipeline, which also affected flows to other European countries including France, Italy and the Netherlands, dashed any remaining hope among European leaders that they can count on Russian gas, perhaps the most difficult fuel to replace. “It is now clear that the contracts that we have with Gazprom are not worth anything anymore,” said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. Analysts say Moscow will probably continue to use gas for maximum leverage, doing what it can to put the brakes on Europe’s efforts to fill storage, in order to keep prices high and increase the vulnerability of countries like Germany and Italy to political pressure over energy. In recent days, the governments of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria have all taken steps to try to conserve gas, in part by turning to coal-fired power plants that either had been shuttered or were scheduled for phaseout. The moves have raised concerns that the European Union’s effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 will be driven off track.

In Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to consider keeping the country’s three nuclear power plants online. The reactors are scheduled to be shut down at the end of the year as part of the country’s efforts to quit nuclear energy. Two years ago, Germany decided to phase out coal-burning power plants by 2038, in its mission to be carbon-free by 2045. But last week Mr. Habeck, who is a member of the Greens party, announced that the government would be temporarily reversing those efforts in response to the gas cutbacks.

The Phase 2 ""alarm stage"", planned for when the government sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages of gas, theoretically enables utilities to pass on high prices to industry and households and thereby help to lower demand. Facing dwindling gas flows from main supplier Russia, Europe's top economy has been at Phase 1 of its emergency plan since end March.

9,"Oversight Board flags lack of user appeals from India, questions Meta’s commitment to non-English content moderation",business," The Oversight Board, a body set up to review content moderation decisions by Meta (formerly Facebook), has questioned the company’s investment in moderating content in languages other than English, pointing at the small number of user appeals from India and other countries. In its first annual report, published on June 22, the Board, which was set up in 2018 by Meta as a quasi judicial body to oversee content moderation on its platforms, noted that 49 percent of the appeals came from the US and Canada. In contrast, only 14 percent came from Latin America and the Caribbean, 9 percent from Asia Pacific and Oceania, 4 percent from the Middle East and North Africa, 2 percent from Central and South Asia, and 2 percent from Sub-Saharan Africa. It is pertinent to note here that India has the most Facebook and Instagram users. While recognising that the number of user appeals does not reflect the total number of Facebook and Instagram users in a country, the Oversight Board said: “Our decisions so far, which covered posts from India and Ethiopia, have raised concerns about whether Meta has invested sufficient resources in moderating content in languages other than English.” The Oversight Board noted that in India and surrounding countries, where there is a mismatch in the number of users and user appeals, people may not be aware that they can appeal to the Board against Meta’s content moderation decisions. “We also do not believe that the distribution of appeals data on this map reflects the actual distribution of content moderation issues around the globe. If anything, we have reason to believe that users in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East experience more, not fewer, problems with Meta’s platforms than other parts of the world,” the Oversight Board added. Additionally, the Board also informed that Meta 'committed' to translate its Community Standards into several languages spoken in India. ""Once completed, more than 400 million more people will be able to read Facebook's rules in their native language,"" it read. Facebook papers The issue regarding Meta's alleged lack of resources for dealing with non-English content moderation was earlier also highlighted in eight complaints Meta employee-turned whistleblower Frances Haugen filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In one of the complaints citing internal records, blamed Facebook users affiliated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for allegedly spreading hate in Hindi and Bengali languages. An excerpt of a Meta internal document in SEC complaint said, ""Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned, and we have yet to put forth a nomination for designation of this group given political sensitivities.""  In its annual report, the Oversight Board highlighted two India-related cases. The first was regarding a video post by Global Punjab TV, featuring a 17-minute interview with a professor, which was shared by a user. In the caption for the video, the post alleged: “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and India’s ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were threatening to kill Sikhs, a minority religious group in India.” After being reported by a user, a human moderator removed it on the grounds that it violated Facebook’s Dangerous Individuals and Organisations Community Standard. This action also led to restrictions on the account of the user who shared the content. After the user appealed Meta’s decision to the Oversight Board, and after the board selected the case, Meta restored the content, “conceding that its initial decision was wrong”. In relation to this matter, the Board said that Meta did not answer two questions: “The first question asked what specific language in the content caused Meta to remove it under the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations Community Standard. Meta responded that it was unable to identify the specific language that led to the erroneous conclusion…” the Board said. “The second question included asking how many “strikes” users need for Meta to impose an account restriction, and how many violations of the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy are required for account-level restrictions. Meta responded that this information was not reasonably required for decision-making…” it added. The second case involved a photo that was posted by a user in a Facebook group that depicted a man holding a sheathed sword and with accompanying texts that described President Emmanuel Macron of France as the “devil”. Facebook removed the content for violating its policy on violence and incitement. However, the Oversight Board revoked the decision. The Board said Meta had failed to answer a question. “The Board’s question asked whether Meta had previously enforced violations under the Violence and Incitement Community Standard against the user or group. Meta responded that information about the user’s previous behavior on the platform was irrelevant to the Board’s determination.” In conclusion, the Board said, ""Despite issues with Meta’s responses to our first recommendations, both Meta and the Board have taken action to improve the recommendations process during 2021."

12,"MC Explains: Why was it necessary to issue cancellation notices to around 3,000 Amrapali buyers?",business," The Supreme Court-appointed court receiver R Venkataramani, tasked with monitoring the completion of real estate company Amrapali’s stalled projects in Noida and Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, has issued notices to almost 3,000 prospective buyers who have neither registered their details on the receiver’s website nor paid their outstanding dues, informing them of their units being cancelled. This was needed as without there being clarity over unclaimed inventory, the flats could not be sold to raise funds for completion of unfinished units. This will also help the court receiver in implementing swapping of units. The Supreme Court in 2019 directed that the former directors of Amrapali Group, Anil Kumar Sharma, Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar, be jailed, and multiple cases have been lodged against them for allegedly diverting homebuyers’ money. The group’s projects were handed over to the government-owned NBCC (India) to complete, and the apex court in 2019 had set a deadline of 2023 for the handover of flats. Amrapali Stalled Projects and Investment Reconstruction Establishment (ASPIRE) has signed an agreement with a consortium of seven public sector banks for the disbursal of a Rs 1,500 crore loan for the stranded projects. Banks have so far released around Rs 600 crore, sources said. The Supreme Court on March 28 had directed the consortium to release Rs 1,500 crore by March 29 so that construction of stalled real estate projects of the embattled Amrapali Group could begin. What has happened? The allotment of homebuyers who have not registered on the portal nor paid any amount has been cancelled with immediate effect. Others who have registered have until the first week of July to pay. The court is expected to next hear the Amrapali case on July 11, 12 and 13. The notice by ASPIRE executed through NBCC (India) said, “In continuation with the notices issued in leading newspapers on Sep 9, 2021 and October 27, 2021, some homebuyers have updated their details in the website of the court receiver. But at the same time the homebuyers mentioned in the list have failed to update their details in the website of the office of the court receiver nor shown any interest in their allotment by making any payment which is due. After giving so many opportunities and time to defaulted homebuyers, this is intimated that allotment of the units of such homebuyers stand cancelled with immediate effect. “Homebuyers who have registered in the portal of the court receiver and not made any payments are hereby given one and final opportunity to make payments within a period of 15 days until July 4, 2022. On failure to do so their units will also be treated as cancelled.” How will this help? This allows the court receiver’s office to identify which units are unclaimed, and start the process of swapping wherein buyers can opt for a unit in a developer’s finished project in lieu of one in an incomplete one or where construction has not commenced and the sale of unsold inventory by Anarock Property Consultants. The cash this generates will part-fund the completion of the projects. Banks that have released funding too have been insisting on getting the unsold inventory as security. In November 2021, NBCC had appointed Anarock as the channel partner to sell Amrapali’s 5,000 housing units in Noida and Greater Noida. In March this year, Anarock said as many as 150 housing units had been sold for Rs 70 crore. Supreme Court advocate Kumar Mihir, who is representing homebuyers in the Amrapali matter, said that this notice is meant for homebuyers who have not come forward till date and whose ownership is yet to be ascertained. “There are several buyers who have opted for swapping of units as their projects were launched without any approvals and have now been scrapped. Those people have to be given the option to shift. The court receiver has been trying to streamline this process for the last two years,” he explained. The sale of these 3,000 or so units, if it goes through, can raise close to Rs 900 crore given that the average price per unit is around Rs 30 lakh, sources said, adding that this amount can help complete three to four projects. Earlier notices The Supreme Court on August 13, 2021, had given 15 days’ notice to 9,538 Amrapali homebuyers to fill their details on the court receiver’s website and start making payments, failing which the court receiver would be at liberty to cancel their allotment and include their units as part of the unsold inventory. The Supreme Court on October 13, 2020, had permitted the court receiver to incorporate a special purpose vehicle to enable flow of funds from the SWAMIH Fund managed by SBICap Ventures, which had promised Rs 650 crore. In November 2019, the central government launched the Special Window for Affordable & Mid-Income Housing fund or the SWAMIH Investment Fund to help complete over 1,500 stalled housing projects, including those that have been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) or had been admitted for insolvency proceedings. The move was to help 4.58 lakh housing units across the country. Only RERA-registered projects with a positive net worth are to be provided funding. The fund is managed by SBICap Ventures. ASPIRE was floated for this reason. It consists of a court receiver, a forensic auditor and a chartered accountant. It is a not-for-profit company under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. The total cost of completing all of Amrapali Group’s stuck projects is approximately Rs 8,500 crore. On July 23, 2019, the top court cancelled the registration of the Amrapali Group under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and ousted it from its prime properties in NCR by nixing land leases for breaching buyers’ trust. How are unclaimed units treated under IBC? There appears to be no statutory framework under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in respect of unclaimed units in case of an insolvency process of a real estate company, say experts."
13,Real estate experts welcome Delhi's decision to extend 20% rebate on circle rate,business," The Delhi government will be extending the rebate of 20 percent on circle rate of land and immovable property for another six months. This decision to continue with reduced rates, say real estate experts, will help both home buyers and sellers. But any changes in circle rates should only be announced as a part of a comprehensive citywide rationalisation and colony recategorisation exercise, they say. “It is being extended. The file is being sent to the chief minister and the Lieutenant Governor,” Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot confirmed to Moneycontrol. The Delhi government on December 31, 2021 extended the 20 percent rebate on circle rate for land and immovable property till June 30, 2022 to help Delhi’s COVID-hit real estate sector. In September 2021, it was extended up to December 31, 2021. The extension of 20 percent relaxation in circle rate was to help Delhi's COVID-hit real estate sector. The circle rates of properties in Delhi fall into eight categories of municipal areas--designated A to H. The circle rates or the official rates of land and immovable property were last revised in 2014. In June 2021, the revenue department formed four working groups to ascertain circle rate revision in residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Real estate experts have welcomed the government’s decision to extend the rebate of 20 percent on circle rate of land and immovable property for another six months. “We appreciate Delhi Government's decision to extend the reduction in circle rates. The reduction in  circle rates by 20% last year, has had a definite and positive impact on  property transactions, especially in Category A localities like Maharani Bagh, New Friends Colony, Panchsheel Park, Vasant Vihar and Hanuman Road. Many properties which were in the market for a long time, but were unable to find a buyer, got sold because of the circle rate rebate,” said Amit Goyal, CEO,  India Sotheby's International Realty."
14,"Explained: How tokenisation, which kicks off on July 1, will make your credit and debit cards safer",business," Come July 1, online shopping using your credit and debit cards will become safer. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has directed payment aggregators, wallets and online merchants not to store any sensitive card related customer information, including full card details. The 16-digit card numbers will get replaced with a ‘token’. The only way that you can conveniently make a card payment repeatedly is through a new process called ‘tokenisation’. “Transactions using cards will remain unaffected by the card tokenisation process,” says Reeju Datta, Co-founder at Cashfree Payments. It will make transactions more secure, he adds. “As a customer, you don’t need to remember the details of a token. The end-customer experience is not changing while making payments,” says Jagdish Kumar, VP Products and Solutions, Digital Commerce, at Worldline India. Here is a primer: What is tokenisation of cards? Until now, whenever you bought things from e-commerce websites or booked train or flight tickets through a travel website you had to save your debit or credit card details for ease in future transactions. You would only enter the three digit CVV number and checkout of the payment transaction within seconds. But saving card details in the current form is risky. There are instances of popular websites getting hacked by fraudsters and harvesting the saved card data. Now, tokenisation will replace a debit or credit card’s 16-digit number with a unique token that is specific to just your card and specific for one merchant at a time. The token masks the true details of your card, so in case there is a data leak from the merchant website, the fraudster cannot misuse the card. Tokens can be used for online transactions, mobile point-of-sale transactions, or in-app transactions. A token contains no personal information that can be accessed and keeps changing, making it the most secure method to complete payments. You do not need your card’s token when you present your card at a physical shop at the check-out counter. “Digital transactions are growing significantly and require safety. In the past there have been instances of data leaks from merchant websites. So, this is a precautionary step by the regulator to enhance card data security,” says Datta.  Is tokenisation mandatory? The tokenisation rule that comes into effect July 1 prohibits all merchant websites from saving your card numbers, CVV or expiry date on their server for processing online transactions. Card users should either make a token before buying an item on the shopping website and save that token on the particular website (for future use) or create a token and save (for future use) at the time of payment after shopping. However, the debit and credit card tokenisation process is not mandatory and customers can choose whether to let their cards get tokenised on a merchant’s website. In that case, a customer will have to re-enter the card details afresh for each transaction, including the 16-digit card number, expiry date and card verification value (CVV) while purchasing anything online. Either way, your card details will not be stored on websites such as Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra and so on. You can either choose to get your card tokenised and store the token or enter your card details every time you buy something online. The countrywide adoption of card tokenisation was extended by six months from January 1 to July 1, 2022 by the RBI to ensure a smooth transition from the current process. On June 8, following the monetary policy committee meeting, RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said in a press conference that the payments ecosystem is “by and large prepared” to implement tokenisation for card-based transactions ahead of the June 30 deadline for new norms. How can I tokenise my card with an online Merchant? While making a payment on an online merchant website or mobile app, enter your card details and opt for tokenisation. Your merchant forwards it to the respective bank or card network (VISA, Rupay, Mastercard, etc). You should opt for tokenisation of cards only if that website is used regularly and you want to avoid the hassle of entering the card details each time. A token will then get generated and sent back to your merchant, who saves it. Now, the next time you come back to shop, just select this saved token at check-out time. You will see the same masked card details and last four digits of your card number. You will need to enter your CVV and complete the transaction. Tokenisation is not mandatory, but it makes it easier to shop repeatedly. Implementation and key challenges RBI Deputy Governor Sankar said all card networks, including Visa, RuPay and Mastercard, are offering tokenisation and have created 16 crore tokens until now. Some merchants, including Swiggy, Cred, Uber, MakeMyTrip, etc. have gone live, and are allowing customers to tokenise their cards. Several leading e-commerce websites are in the final stages of integrating the tokenisation process and are expected to start tokenising cards soon. “With implementation of tokenisation, we expect challenges in processing of purchases made through equated monthly instalments (EMIs), processing cashbacks and rewards to customers in the absence of card data,” says a spokesperson from an e-commerce website requesting anonymity. On these new challenges, RBI Deputy Governor Sankar said: “The ecosystem is working on a few collateral issues that have come to the RBI's notice, which we will adjust as we go. There are new issues that crop up every time you shift a regime.” Can a token on one merchant be used for another? No, a token registered on one merchant cannot be used on another merchant. Each merchant will have a unique token associated with every card saved. For instance, if you have an HDFC Bank credit card tokenised on Flipkart, the same card will have a different token on Amazon. Essentially, your card will have multiple tokens, based on the number of merchants you tokenise your card with. How can I delete or manage the tokens generated? If you want to remove a token you save on a merchant website, you can delete that token on the merchant’s website or app and delete the card associated with the token from your payment preferences. Alternatively, banks also provide help in deleting tokens. For instance, SBI card customers can call on a helpline to request for deletion. Harshil Mathur, CEO and Co-Founder of Razorpay, says that a card issuing bank will now provide a dedicated portal (on its own website) to manage tokenised cards. Your dashboard will now show you a list of your cards and where (merchants) you have tokenised them. From this dashboard you can delete the tokenised cards from websites you do not use frequently. Is the tokenisation service free? Yes, tokenisation of cards is absolutely free, and can be availed by anyone. Currently, tokenisation is applicable only to domestic cards. This guideline does not cover international cards. You can request for tokenisation on any number of cards to perform a transaction. What will happen to a token once a card is replaced or renewed or reissued or upgraded?"
15,IT will continue to receive tailwinds from strong deal activity and digital transformation,business," The Indian IT industry is likely to sail through global economic challenges at least in the first quarter of the current financial year, going by views of CLSA which are based on the global brokerage firm's recent interaction with offshore advisory company ISG. Optimism about a strong show in 2022 CLSA feels the deal momentum has remained strong across geographies and business verticals, though there were some instances of minor delays in decision-making in some parts of Europe and in the manufacturing vertical across many geographies due to rising input costs and supply chain disruption in China. However, IT budgets are not likely to witness any cuts and may remain stable despite risks from macro-economic factors. Any impact on the budgets may likely start percolating only in 2023. The optimism also stems from the fact that all enterprises recognise the importance of technology to achieve their business objectives which is likely to cushion the impact from a hardening business environment. “ISG expects a 5.1 percent year on year growth in managed services annual contract value in 2022, twice the historical average,” a note from CLSA said. Pricing remains stable Macroeconomic concerns so far have not had any impact on the deal pricing and commercial negotiations and vendors have been successful in passing on the 4-7 percent increase in billing rates for time and material based projects. However, the pass-through has been higher at 15 percent for skills that are in huge demand. Attrition continues to hog the limelight Increased attrition across the sector has been a major cause of concern not only for the IT companies but also for the end consumer which is faced with delays in transition in managed services deals and also in start of new projects. CLSA is of the opinion that attrition may have likely peaked out but is likely to remain elevated in the near to medium term. The customers are also apprehensive about productivity levels of fresh hires that the companies have recruited directly from the campus to overcome a paucity of resources. The productivity levels of these fresh hands is a key monitorable for the customers as they see the scalability of production as a major cause of concern for timely implementation of projects. Digital makes the difference With the technology assuming greater importance to achieve business growth and other business objectives, the note from CLSA says that it is very much likely that a cut in IT spends by the businesses will be the last priority. Also, with most organisations in initial phases of the cloud/digital transformation journeys and witnessing constant evolution of technology, their dependence on external service providers has increased more than ever. This augers well for the Indian IT companies which are leading the digital transformation for businesses across geographies. Outlook CLSA in its note reiterated that “a potential economic slowdown in end markets should have only a modest impact on revenue growth for Indian IT companies”. However, the EPS (earnings per share) estimates might see a bit of a trimming due to the sharp cross currency moves witnessed during the current quarter as macro uncertainties remain an overhang on the valuations of the sector. The global brokerage bets strongly on Infosys due to its higher growth visibility and it finds Tata Consultancy Services stock attractive, “given its skills in structuring large cost-takeout transactions and strong margin defence”. Also, the risk-reward for HCL Technologies now looks attractive given its strong FY22 exit order book, healthy free cash flow yield and correction in its valuations as the stock is trading 30 percent below its 52 week highs.

17,Mansukh Mandaviya to chair crucial meeting with experts on rising COVID-19 cases,business," Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya will on Thursday chair a high-level review meeting with the core team of experts over increasing cases of COVID-19 in the country, official sources said. India has been witnessing an increase in coronavirus infections over the last couple of weeks. As on date, ten states -- Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and Gujarat -- have over 1,000 active cases. India saw a single-day rise of 13,313 new coronavirus infections, taking the infection tally to 4,33,44,958, while the active cases have increased to 83,990, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Thursday. The death toll has climbed to 5,24,941 with 38 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am stated. In a review meeting of INSACOG held last week, states/UTs were asked to submit ""larger number"" of samples for whole genome sequencing from districts and areas which have seen a surge in COVID-19 cases over a period of seven days. In a review meeting of INSACOG held last week, states/UTs were asked to submit ""larger number"" of samples for whole genome sequencing from districts and areas which have seen a surge in COVID-19 cases over a period of seven days. The direction was issued to check the possibility of any new emerging variant or sub-variant and ascertain the reasons behind the breakthrough infections, sources had said. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. According to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) experts, Omicron and its sublineages, primarily BA. 2 and BA.2.38, as of now, seem to be behind the current rise in Covid cases, an official source had said. The BA.2 and its sublineages constitute over 85 per cent of the cases with BA.2.38 being found in around 33 per cent of the samples. The percentage of BA.4 and BA.5 is found in less than 10 per cent samples, they had said. Forty-three districts in India, including 11 from Kerala, six from Mizoram and five from Maharashtra, are reporting a weekly Covid positivity rate of more than 10 per cent. In 42 districts, including eight from Rajasthan, five from Delhi and four from Tamil Nadu, the weekly positivity is between 5 and 10 per cent, sources said."

20,Uber is said to have explored a sale of Indian ride-hailing arm,business," Uber Technologies Inc. explored options for its Indian ride-hailing business, including a sale, but suspended discussions after tech startup valuations cratered, people familiar with the matter said. The US company began weighing alternatives and reached out to several interested parties after recognizing it had limited potential for profitable expansion in the country, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. It pondered a stock swap with local companies or even a pullout, before a global equity market rout upended plans, the people added. A stock deal was favored in exploratory talks as that would allow Uber to retain a foothold in India, the people said. Uber and its local-rival Ola had been struggling to eke out a profit in a rapidly growing but price-sensitive market, where constant driver attrition was pressuring margins. A sale to a local operator could have mirrored similar deals it struck with Didi Global Inc. in China and Grab Holdings Ltd. in Southeast Asia, where Uber ceded the markets but kept an equity stake in the dominant local player to tap future growth. The maneuvers ended costly turf wars waged with driver incentives and cash subsidies. Uber disputed the idea it had considered retreating from India. “Bloomberg’s reporting is categorically false. We have never explored exiting India — not even for a minute,” company spokesperson Ruchica Tomar said in an emailed statement. Uber remains committed to India and continues to hire people “aggressively.” Uber, whose shares have gyrated wildly since its 2019 IPO, has hived off money-losing businesses to achieve its goal of being consistently profitable. In May, it delivered a positive outlook for earnings, signaling the company plans to capitalize on robust ride demand without compromising profits by focusing on product changes, rather than incentives, to address a driver shortage. India and Japan are the sole major remaining Asian markets for Uber, which has scaled back sharply since the tumultuous days of former chief Travis Kalanick. The San Franciso-based company started services in India in 2013 and now offers ride-hailing in almost 100 cities across the country, its website showed. Conversations around an India deal had been preliminary and the company could decide not to revisit those options, the people said."

Chaayos will use the fresh fund for tech-enhancement, hiring, and store expansion, the company said. “The latest capital raise will help us deepen our technology investments to further enhance our guest experience...We will continue to grow our cafe footprint and go deeper into the cities we are present in and explore new markets. We are also continuously on the lookout to hire talent to handle the scale that we aspire for,” said Nitin Saluja, co-founder of Chaayos. Chaayos did not disclose the valuation at which the company raised the funds, but reportedly, the company has been valued at $240-250 million. Chaayos competes with major players in tea cafes such as Chai Point, Chai Thela, and Tea Trails. Companies such as Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) also offer various varieties of tea under their banners. Recently, Coffee Day Global Ltd, which owns and operates popular coffee chain has posted a net profit of ₹65.40 crore for the fourth quarter ended on March 31, 2022. The company’s positive growth seems to be a result of Covid-19 restrictions easing down and as a result, the demand for cafes going up. Founded in 2012, by Saluja and Raghav Verma, Chaayos is a tea cafe chain with 190 stores across six Indian cities and plans to add 100 more by the end of 2022. The fundraise comes at a time when startups are getting conservative and are attempting to extend their runway in an uncertain funding environment. Since the beginning of 2022, startups have laid off over 10,000 employees and the number keeps growing. Chaayos claims to provide its customers an option to personalise their cup of tea in 80,000 combinations. The company said, “The IoT-enabled (Internet of things-enabled) patented tea bots called Chai Monks, help in fast brewing of a cup of tea without any training.” Chaayos, today claims to have a Net Promoter Score or NPS of 78. Chaayos said it uses artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up processes on its platform. For instance, Chaayos uses facial recognition software to enable faster checkouts and payments. In 2019, however, the company had to face fire for the use of facial recognition while billing customers as Twitterati had expressed concerns over it. Users also raised questions after the terms and conditions of the company had been found to state that customers should not expect their information to always remain private. In its response to issues flagged by customers, Chaayos had said the data from the facial recognition feature was encrypted and could not be accessed by any party, including Chaayos itself except for the purpose of logging in our customers."

2,3 smart and easy actions that help boost your CIBIL Score,business," Given the importance of your CIBIL Score for getting your new application for credit approved, it is crucial to ensure that you have a good score. New and affordable credit can come in handy when you’re paying your children’s tuition, building or renovating your home, have a medical emergency, or when you’re going on vacation or meeting other life goals. There are various factors that account for your CIBIL Score, and a negative impact on these will decrease your score. This can not only lead to a rejection of your loan application but also get you a lower amount than desired at a higher cost. Thankfully, you can keep your score in check by taking the necessary steps. One of the simplest ways to stay informed about your score is by using the free CIBIL Score checking service that is available online. You can access this on the official CIBIL website as well as via lenders like Bajaj Finserv who allow you to make a CIBIL Score free check. Once you know your score, you can get information on why your score is low by studying your CIBIL report. Read on to know how to address these issues and boost your CIBIL Score. Make timely monthly payments Ensuring you do not miss out on your monthly dues is the best way to have a healthy credit score. Your payment history and discipline account for about 35% of your CIBIL Score. When you check your CIBIL Score by PAN card or using other financial details, you also know if you have outstanding dues. With this information, you can carefully plan your repayment to improve your score. Whether you have a loan or a credit card, make sure you do not miss your EMIs or bill payments. Use digital reminders or auto-pay services to ensure you don’t miss deadlines. If you are missing payment due to a lack of funds, plan your credit better and don’t overborrow in the future. Borrow a mix of credit options The most experience you have with different types of credit, the higher your CIBIL Score will be. This includes collateral-free as well as secured loans and credit cards. The amount of secured and unsecured debt you have is also an important constituent of your CIBIL Score. Having too much-unsecured debt, such as personal loans or credit cards, can negatively impact your creditworthiness. Along with secured and unsecured debt, you should make sure that you have both short-term and long-term credit. All these points toward having enough credit experience, making your profile seem more reliable to lenders. Pay heed to your credit utilisation ratio How much credit you use up also affects your high or healthy score. Generally, you should not use over 30% of your credit limit. Using your credit card up to its limit each month can lead to a low credit score as this behaviour reveals the fact that you do not live within your means. To understand your credit balance and utilisation ratio, use the CIBIL Score check free service available on various platforms. Fix errors in your credit profile Credit rating agencies like CIBIL get information from financial intuitions, which may sometimes be incorrect or delayed. For instance, you may have paid off a loan in full, while your credit report still shows the loan as existing debt. By getting these mistakes rectified, your credit score can increase. Follow the simple process outlined to intimate CIBIL about errors, and your score will soon improve. This is where free CIBIL Score checking services can help you find errors in your report, so make sure to check your score and report consistently. Remember that you may not notice any instant change in your CIBIL Score, which is why you need to be patient and consistent in your actions to improve your credit score. Inculcating the right financial habits is key to improving your CIBIL Score, including ensuring you build your credit experience, pay off debt early when possible and take loans or sign up for new credit cards only after careful planning. Another important step here is to update yourself on your credit score and read your credit report often. Bajaj Finserv offers you a way to do a free CIBIL Score check by PAN card details that has no impact on your score. It allows you to check your credit score, see your credit report, and get exciting offers too! With free credit score checking, you can stay informed about your creditworthiness and take measures if needed. Try this today and take steps to boost your credit score by being responsible and diligent with your finances."
3,"Moneycontrol Market Sentiment Survey | Fund managers buying largecaps stocks in downturn, prefer banks most",business," Domestic money managers are buying largecaps to survive the current downturn in the stock market with maximum preference for banks while they are dumping shares of metal companies, the latest edition of Moneycontrol’s Market Sentiment Survey showed. As many as 73 percent of the fund managers surveyed by Moneycontrol said that they were focusing on buying largecap stocks in the current corrective phase of the market because of greater stability in earnings as well as the moderation in their valuations.  Overall, an overwhelming majority of fund managers from the mutual fund and portfolio management space said that they expect banks to have the brightest year even as the Nifty Bank index has fallen nearly 6 percent in 2022. A sector where they are bearish is metals with seven out 10 fund managers indicating that they are booking profits in the sector. The Nifty Metal index has plummeted 17 percent so far in 2022 with June itself seeing a 14 percent crack.  The survey saw participation from 10 asset managers with a cumulative assets under management of Rs 2.1 lakh crore. Overall, the surveyed fund managers indicated optimism for the second half of the calendar year with over five out of 10 managers expecting a rebound in the market over the next six months after a more than 10 percent drawdown so far.  Their optimism for the second half likely rests on their outlook for corporate earnings in 2022-23. As much as 60 percent of the surveyed fund managers expected earnings of Nifty 50 companies to grow 10-15 percent in the current financial year, similar to the May edition of the survey.  Much of the current correction in the market has been driven by macro-economic factors such as soaring global crude oil prices, interest rate hikes by central banks to tame inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war. The majority of the surveyed asset managers see no softening in global crude oil prices going ahead as they expect the commodity to hover in the range of $100-125 per barrel even as fears of an impending recession in the US and European Union mount.  Further, 50 percent of the asset managers also expect the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee to raise interest by another 100-125 basis points on top of the 90 basis points of rate hike undertaken by the central bank. Multi-year high inflation and rising future expectations of inflation has forced the RBI to hike interest rates to ensure price stability and contain macroeconomic fallout of high inflation. Also Read: The Red Queen, nihilists and other insights from the MPC minutes Having said that, fund managers were divided on what could be the trigger that could bring respite to the domestic stock market. Fund managers indicated that a resolution of the ongoing war in Ukraine or a plunge in global crude oil prices could act as a trigger for a relief rally on Dalal Street."

5,"Vodafone Idea defers Rs 8,837 crore AGR dues payment, gets option to pay interest via equity",business," Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea has decided to defer payment of additional adjusted gross revenues of Rs 8,837 crore dues by a period of four years. The company in a late night filing on June 22, said that the DoT on June 15, has raised adjusted gross revenue (AGR) demand for additional two financial years beyond 2016-17, which were not covered under the Supreme court order on the statutory dues. Vodafone Idea (VIL) in the filing said that its board of directors ""has approved the exercise of the option of deferment of the AGR related dues by a period of four years with immediate effect, in accordance with the said DoT Letter. The amount of the AGR related dues as stated in the said DoT Letter is Rs 8,837 crores which is subject to revision on account of disposal of various representations"". The government calculates its share of revenue from telecom operators based on their AGR, which is considered to have been earned by them from the sale of services. VIL filing said that the DoT has offered the company a moratorium of four years for all AGR related dues up to Financial Year 2018-19, which were not included in Supreme Court order dated September 1, 2022 which can be exercised within a period of 15 days by June 30. ""The said DoT Letter also provides the Company an option for equity conversion of interest dues upfront for these AGR related dues for which a period of 90 days has been provided from the date of the said DoT Letter,"" VIL said. The company said the fresh demand of Rs 8,837 crore is subject to revision on account of disposal of various representations, CAG, special audit and any other outcome of litigation and ""the final amount to be paid in six equal annual instalments post moratorium period starting from March 31, 2026"". The government has already approved Vodafone Idea's proposal to convert about Rs 16,000 crore interest payment dues of previous AGR moratorium into around 33 per cent stake in the company. According to official data, telecom operators owe over Rs 1.65 lakh crore to the government in adjusted gross revenue up to financial year 2018-19. The fresh calculation shows AGR liability on Bharti Airtel was Rs 31,280 crore, Vodafone Idea Rs 59,236.63 crore, Reliance Jio Rs 631 crore, BSNL Rs 16,224 crore, MTNL Rs 5,009.1 crore up to financial year 2018-19. The company in a separate filing said that its board has approved raising of Rs 436.21 crore from Vodafone Group company Euro Pacific Securities through issue of preferential share at a unit price of Rs 10.2 apiece or warrants at the same price."
6,Storyboard18 | Which influencer categories will be most affected by TDS on freebies?,business," With a move by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to expand the government’s tax base, 10 percent TDS on freebies and business promotions might have a significant impact on most of the influencers. But, it might have little effect on categories like finance influencers because they don't usually get freebies or merchandise. That’s because most of their ads are based on services instead of product promotions. So who will it impact the most? The categories of influencers which would be most affected are lifestyle, fashion, tech (electronics) and travel. For example, if a company sponsors a trip of a travel influencer for Rs 1 lakh, then the company will be liable to deduct Rs 10,000 as TDS. Same goes with the goodies provided to lifestyle and fashion influencers. Even the tech influencers often get freebies worth above Rs 20,000, which is the non tax limit. But it has also been notified by the CBDT that no charges will be applied if the gifts are returned to the company after the purpose of sales promotion has been fulfilled. What are companies likely to do now? So my best guess is, with promotion of durable goods like phones, cameras, or laptops which are above Rs 20,000, the companies might just skip the gifting system and rather rent out for free for the required duration to the content creators. Coming to non-durable or perishable goods, like let’s say promotion of a bakery where they send you cakes or cookies, they anyway barely cross Rs 20,000. Talking about finance influencers, they usually do not receive free tickets on IPL matches or trips for sales promotions for that matter. Also, usually the promotions finfluencers do are taxed. Freebies are a rare thing in their niche. Hence, with or without this new development, anyway they are liable for 1 to 10 percent TDS. So, I do not see a significant impact on social media niches which are information+entertainment centric. And the bottom line?"
7,"Tata Steel plans low CO2 steel-making technologies in UK, Netherlands",business," Tata Steel is working on a plan for transition to low carbon technologies for making steel in the UK and the Netherlands.

8,Storyboard18 - Stacks & Strategies | Influencer marketing meets ad tech,business," A state of flux. That is what the business of influencer marketing has been like since its inception in India. Expected to grow at a CAGR of about 25% in the next five years, it is certain that the only constant is a rapid and swift change. Neither brands nor agencies have the privilege of doing the ‘hygiene influencing’ campaign for broader awareness. Today, many innovative startups are mushrooming each day, and they are observed to be investing heavily in social media marketing via influencers and content creators. Mostly driven by young minds, every marketing initiative means business to them. Like startups, today, many leading brands also target direct business and revenue results via marketing. And rightly so! Living in a highly competitive world, why would one not focus on growing financially. After all, every company and brand needs sales for survival. Therefore, be it Instagram Shops or YouTube’s shoppable ads, social media today has truly emerged as a ‘shopping experience’ for consumers and ‘point of sales' for retail brands. From bait and click to influence and click; and cost per view to cost per click, the world of influencer marketing briskly changed over the last few years. When Influencer Marketing met AdTech The best things happen when the emotional intelligence of a human and tech-enabled experiences meet. While AR and VR are the leading testament of this in the broader world, shoppable ads and live-commerce are trending examples in the world of influencer marketing. While content creators bring in the emotional appeal, the social media platforms upscale their technology to provide the best experiences for the brands, consumers, and creators. Shoppable ads come with an opportunity for brands to add a shopping link and provide a complete 360 shopping experience: grab the attention – influence – click – buy. However, while the creator’s role is only to influence ‘clicks’ it is the brand’s UI and UX that ensures the purchase. Hence, to convert an audience to a lead, and a lead to a customer via influencer marketing, it requires – a great story/narrative, a unique purchase link, and immersive UI and UX. Live shopping is one of the latest disruptions in the world of e-commerce. This concept was first widely practised and accepted in east Asian countries. It started with fashion and beauty creators conducting YouTube and Instagram live sessions to influence and sell a product. Such activity garnered immense response amongst audiences and pushed them for ‘instant buys’ during the live stream. Brands, influencers, and the platform have largely capitalized on the ‘FOMO culture’. Will Influencer Marketing meet programmatic ads? Programmatic ads emerged as the most preferred accelerator for brands to get quick and scalable results. Alongside, influencer marketing has thus far helped many brands to build their brand value and awareness. What would happen when two legacy mediums meet? With many startups now creating AI-driven influencer marketing platforms, integration of ‘programmatic influencer marketing’ service will only help in bringing the much-needed disruption. Programmatic branded influencer marketing content will reduce manual labour, scale the brand’s reach and sales, and speed up the entire process. Challenges we must fight With the introduction of tech in influencer marketing, creators will have constant pressure to ‘persuade to click’. Hence, the brands will have to be rational with their ask and a common ground of views and clicks will have to be made before each campaign. Brands must understand that influencers aren’t their sales associates and expecting direct conversion from them is unrealistic. Moreover, brands today lay very stringent content guidelines with limited room for creativity. Therefore, pushing creators to create direct selling and TVC-like content will help no one. As it is the content that will lead to clicks, getting room for some creative content creation will be the biggest challenge. In a nutshell While social media platforms are constantly evolving to provide direct sales opportunities; influencers, marketing managers, and brands must understand and embrace the correlation between the content, clicks, and conversions. Irrespective of how advanced the adtech gets, the ultimate push factor will be the ‘persuasive content’."

11,"Half of new US entrepreneurs are women, leading a creation boom",business," Women and minorities have been fueling the boom in business creation of the past two years in the US. A survey found that almost half of 2021’s new entrepreneurs were women, a significant uptick from 28% in 2019. And the share of new Black business owners tripled to 9%, according to Gusto, a payroll and human-resource management business. The findings confirmed similar gains in separate research by web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc. Among the factors behind the surge in female entrepreneurship: child-care responsibilities. With schools and child-care centers still disrupted last year, a growing share of parents -- particularly women -- started their own business out of necessity. In the Gusto survey, more than a quarter of female business owners with school-aged children said they created their company in response to increased child-care duties.  A record 5.4 million new businesses were formed in the US last year, according to the Census Bureau, showing that the burst of creation seen in the early months of the pandemic has legs. While some of the Covid entrepreneurship was born of necessity in the early days after millions of workers lost their jobs, today’s business owners are more likely to be motivated by better opportunities. Among Black respondents in the Gusto survey, more than one-third created a business to improve their financial stability -- a larger share than their White and Hispanics counterparts. Overall, the study found that many workers are “placing a premium on the flexibility and autonomy afforded by self-employment, and they are quitting paid employment in favor of entrepreneurship.” The types of businesses have changed as well compared with 2020. About half of new professional-service firms were started by owners who quit their job in the same industry, creating competition for their old firm.  To map out where entrepreneurs are, economists at UCLA Anderson Forecast developed an index of microbusiness activity using data from GoDaddy. At the top of the index was Santa Clara, California. Other highly ranked areas included counties that surround Washington, D.C., -- where new firms can feed off government contracts -- as well as Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York."

15,Juul e-cigarettes to be ordered off US shelves,business," Shares in tobacco giant Altria Group, which owns a 35% stake in the vaping products maker, fell 8.5% following the report. The decision could come as early as Wednesday, the report said. Juul has faced heightened scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers and state attorneys general over the appeal of its nicotine products to teenagers. Under pressure, the company in late 2019 had halted U.S. sales of several flavors. The FDA declined to comment on the report, while Altria and Juul did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. ""This clearly comes as a surprise to the market ... we would expect that Juul would appeal the decision, and remain on the market through that process, which would likely take a year or more,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said. The looming verdict comes nearly two years after Juul had applied for approval to keep selling e-cigarettes in the country. The FDA's review of the applications was based on whether the e-cigarettes are effective in getting smokers to quit and, if so, whether the benefits to smokers outweigh the health damage to new users, including teenagers. In October, the FDA had allowed Juul rival British American Tobacco Plc to market its Vuse Solo e-cigarettes and tobacco-flavored pods, the first-ever vapor product to get clearance from the health regulator. The estimated fair value of Altria's investment in Juul was $1.6 billion as of March end, a fraction of the $12.8 billion it paid in 2018, as a crackdown on vaping has upended the once fast-growing industry. ""The investment in Juul was always a mistake, the company paying top dollar for a business which was already clearly (on) the wrong side of the regulators,"" said Rae Maile, analyst at Panmure Gordon.

16,"Gold Prices Today: Yellow metal to come under selling pressure after Powell's comments; support around Rs 50,500",business," Gold prices inched lower on Thursday in international markets, pressured by expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes after the US Federal Reserve chief doubled down on the central bank's fight against inflation. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,832.91 per ounce by 0239 GMT. US gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,834.30. At 9.33am, gold contracts were trading 0.29 percent lower at Rs 50,756 for 10 grams on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), while silver was down 0.81 percent to Rs 60,159 a kilogram. Gold prices increased moderately as the benchmark treasury yield and US dollar index continued to decline. ""As Powell predicts a likely recession on higher rate rises, early losses are offset by gold prices. He suggests doing everything he can to stop price rises, even if it means a rate hike of 100 basis points. With Powell's testimony at the Fed, the US front's flash manufacturing PMI data and unemployment claims will continue to be significant for gold and silver prices today. The notion that precious metal prices are range-bound suggests that there may be selling pressure near the range's upper end. Gold has resistance at Rs 51300 and support at Rs 50500. Silver has resistance at Rs 61300 and support at Rs 59800,"" said Nirpendra Yadav, senior commodity research analyst at Swastika Investmart.

MCX gold August support lies at Rs 50600 and resistance at Rs 51300 per 10 grams. Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Gold and silver prices eased on Wednesday after the Fed chairman's testimony and firming up of the dollar. Bullion traded in a narrow range as investors awaited fresh cues from top central banks on their monetary policy plans, especially from the US Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman’s testimony was a reiteration of the central bank's commitment to bring down inflation with aggressive rate hikes that may send the economy into a recession. Geopolitical uncertainty and rising concerns of economic slowdown are likely to support precious metals. Gold has support at $1828-1816, while resistance is at $1852-1861. Silver has support at $21.10-20.85, while resistance is at $21.65-21.95. In rupee terms, gold has support at Rs 50,540–50,210, while resistance is at Rs 50,980–51,240.

17,Maharashtra political crisis: 3 more Shiv Sena MLAs leave for Guwahati,business," Amid the political crisis in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, three more Shiv Sena MLAs on Thursday left for Guwahati in Assam to join the rebel camp led by cabinet minister Eknath Shinde. Deepak Kesakar (MLA from Sawantwadi), Mangesh Kudalkar (Chembur) and Sada Sarvankar (Dadar) took a morning flight from Mumbai to Guwahati, a close associate of Shinde said. On Wednesday evening, four MLAs, including Maharashtra minister Gulabrao Patil, had flown to Guwahati. Shinde will consult the MLAs with him and then decide when to return to Mumbai, his associate said. After reaching Guwahati on Wednesday, Shinde had claimed the support of 46 legislators, including some Independents. He had given a letter to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly's deputy speaker, signed by 35 Sena MLAs, replacing Sunil Prabhu with Bharat Gogavale as the chief whip of the Shiv Sena legislature party. Shinde has maintained that while the NCP and the Congress were growing stronger in the MVA alliance, the Shiv Sena, which heads the governing bloc, and its workers were getting systematically weakened. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday night vacated his official residence, hours after reaching out to Shiv Sena dissidents with an emotional appeal and offering to quit, even as rebel leader Shinde remained defiant and insisted the party should walk out of the ""unnatural"" ruling alliance MVA, and claimed the support of ""enough number"" of MLAs. The CM had moved out of 'Varsha', his official residence in south Mumbai, and shifted to Matoshree, the Thackeray family's private bungalow in suburban Bandra, amid high drama as the Shiv Sena asserted he will not resign in the wake of rebellion by Shinde, who is camping with rebel MLAs in Guwahati."

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time."
20,Samsung Australia fined $9.7 million over false water-resistance claims,business," Australia's competition regulator said on Thursday a court has ordered the local unit of Samsung Electronics to pay a penalty of A$14 million ($9.65 million) over misleading claims about a water-resistance feature in some of its smartphones. Samsung Australia admitted to misleading buyers of some of its 'Galaxy' phones about the water-resistance level, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. The regulator had first sued the company https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-samsung-elec-regulator-idINS9N21Y008 in July 2019. The regulator said that between March 2016 and October 2018, the company ran in-store and social media advertisements that claimed the phones could be used in pools or sea water. The ACCC, however, received hundreds of complaints from users saying the smartphones did not function properly or even stopped working entirely after being exposed to water. The claims ""promoted an important selling point for these Galaxy phones. Many consumers who purchased a Galaxy phone may have been exposed to the misleading ads before they made their decision to purchase a new phone,"" said ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb."
21,Chilean miners strike at copper giant Codelco; government plays down impact,business," Workers at Chilean state-owned mining giant Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, launched a major strike on Wednesday to protest the closure of a smelter over environmental issues, though the government downplayed the impact on operations. The Federation of Copper Workers (FTC), an umbrella group of Codelco's unions, said 50,000 workers were expected to strike, including staff and contractors after the Ventanas smelter was shuttered despite calls for investment to keep it open. ""We already have all divisions stopped today,"" Amador Pantoja, the union's president told Reuters. ""We're going to wait calmly in the morning to see if there's a chance to talk."" The government and the company, however, moved quickly to dispel concerns over an impact to operations. ""There is no stoppage of mining sites,"" Finance Minister Mario Marcel said at a news conference, hours after the strike started. ""Therefore the impact on financial income is basically zero."" Andre Sougarret, Codelco's interim chief executive, said there has been ""some discontinuity"" regarding operations, but the company was able to take steps to resume them. ""Since this was announced, we took steps to, first of all, guarantee people's safety and, on the other hand, continue operations,"" Sougarret said. Later in the day, the FTC said protest leaders had been detained by police forces while protesting outside of the company's El Teniente mine. ""Due to these regretful incidents, we're suspending any attempt at talks with Codelco's upper administration and actively continue with our National Strike,"" the FTC said in a statement. Codelco's board of directors approved the closure of the Ventanas smelter last week after it had been suspended for maintenance after dozens in the region fell ill. The decision was later backed by Chilean President Gabriel Boric. The facility also operates a copper refinery, which will not be affected by the measure. Workers had warned last week they would strike if investments to upgrade the facility were not approved and insisted on Tuesday the company should upgrade the smelter. The area the smelter is located in is saturated with industrial operations that environmental activists have described as a ""sacrifice zone"" due to pollution incidents."
22,"US recession fears darken outlook for Japan, global factories",business," Japan's factory activity growth slowed to a four-month low in June as China's COVID-19 curbs disrupted supply chains, while many other economies in Asia were also facing headwinds amid growing risks to the outlook from a potential U.S. recession. Australia's manufacturing activity held steady this month, data showed on Thursday which, together with Japan's figures, come ahead of a string of European and U.S. purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys due out later in the day. The readings will be closely scrutinised as financial markets fret over sharp interest rises by the Federal Reserve, and further aggressive tightening planned over coming months, which have substantially raised the risk of a U.S. recession. ""The global macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated materially since end-2021,"" said Fitch Ratings, which slashed this year's global growth outlook to 2.9% in June from 3.5% in March. ""Stagflation, which is characterised by persistent high inflation, high unemployment and weak demand, has become the dominant risk theme since late 1Q22 and a plausible potential risk scenario,"" it said in a report released this week. A growing number of market players, including U.S. investment firm PIMCO, are warning of the risk of a recession as central banks across the globe tighten monetary policy to fight persistently high inflation. A string of recent data globally showed policymakers are walking a tight rope as they try to defuse inflation pressures without tipping their respective economies into a steep downturn. U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in May and existing home sales tumbled to a two-year low, a sign high inflation and rising borrowing costs were starting to hurt demand. Britain's economy unexpectedly shrank in April, adding to fears of a sharp slowdown as companies complain of rising cost of production. In Asia, South Korea's exports for the first 10 days of June shrank almost 13% year-on-year, underscoring the heightening risk to the region's export-driven economies. And in China, while exporters enjoyed solid sales in May, helped by easing domestic COVID-19 curbs, many analysts expect a more challenging outlook for the world's second-biggest economy due to the Ukraine war and rising raw material costs. The au Jibun Bank flash Japan Manufacturing PMI slipped to 52.7 in June from 53.3 in May, marking the slowest expansion since February, the survey showed on Thursday. In a sign of the pandemic's lingering impact, auto giant Toyota Motor Corp cut its July global production plan by 50,000 vehicles as semiconductor shortages and COVID-19 parts supply disruptions continued to curb output. ""Despite the recent easing of lockdowns in China, suppliers' delivery times continued to lengthen last month, albeit at a slightly slower pace,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. The key for Japan will be whether consumption rebounds strongly enough from a pandemic-induced slump, to offset emerging external headwinds such as an expected U.S. slowdown, analysts say."

5,"Started your university classes abroad already? Now, keep an eye on these upcoming expenses",business," It’s safe to assume that when students leave Indian shores to study abroad, much of their money matters have already been sorted out. The course fees have been paid for, either through parents’ savings or an education loans, at least for the first one or two years. The accommodation has been taken care of or at least the funds for is have been earmarked. New clothes would have been bought, especially winter wear. These are the basics. But things could go off track. Events such as currency fluctuations or unexpected expenses are beyond your control. These unforeseen expenses can derail their well-crafted budgets. Also read: Planning to apply for education loans? Know the do’s and don’ts Here are some tips that you can use to ensure that your stay in a foreign country does not run into financial hiccups. Get prepaid cards, local bank accounts for regular spends Let’s face it. You need money when you live abroad. To buy you groceries if you’re living in a rented accommodation, to pay for canteen food if you are living in a hostel, for your commute to the college, and impulse spending for an occasional movie outing. Identify and activate your spending tools; banks accounts to which your parents can transfer funds from India, prepaid cards, credit cards and so on. For your recurring and other expenses, you can open bank accounts with local banks in the country you are studying in, say experts. “Choose the bank that is most convenient for you. Typically, many banks do visit campuses during freshers’ orientation sessions and offer freebies to students to get them to open accounts. You can use the debit card linked to the account for spending,” says Nisreen Mamaji, Founder and CEO, Moneyworks Financial Services. Mamaji has, over the years, advised her clients and their children who go abroad to pursue higher education. She adds: “Students should also carry an international card issued in India before they fly out. This can come in handy during emergencies or if there is a delay in money getting transferred abroad. Parents should also shop around for the most competitive forex rates every time they make a transfer,” explains Mamaji. A prepaid forex card is also a must in your wallet. They offer convenience, besides lower transaction charges compared to credit cards. “Sometimes, money transfer from India could get delayed, which could result in children being stranded abroad without money for a couple of days. Prepaid forex cards come in handy during such times,” she adds. Use credit cards sparingly A  credit card can be of immense help especially during emergencies or unexpected, but unavoidable, expenses. “For instance, an unplanned, university-mandated trip could come up which parents may not be have budgeted for. You can use the credit card and parents will have 30 more days to arrange for the funds and clear the credit card bills (from India),” says Mamaji. You might not be eligible for one immediately after moving overseas due to lack of credit history, so you might have to obtain an international credit card – or an add-on along with your parents’ cards - before flying out. However, ensure that you use your credit card prudently, especially if you are paying for it, abroad. A default due to overspending will affect credit history of your parents in India. If you are using your own credit card issued in your destination country, a default or delayed bill payment will dent your credit score, affecting your chances of securing credit later. It could also be a black mark if you intend to settle down in that country. Buy adequate health insurance You ought to have adequate health insurance to take care of medical emergencies or even evacuation, if required. You have to consider options offered by your university, through tie-ups with local insurers, or buy a policy from Indian insurance companies before leaving Indian shores. Dhaval Mehta, Founder, TNI Career Counselling, believes that students are better off with a policy offered through their universities. ""They tend to be tailor-made for overseas students in those universities and offer comprehensive coverage,"" he says. Some universities, in fact, insist on students buying insurance covers from insurers they have teamed up with. However, overseas student travel insurance policies offered by Indian insurers are usually cheaper and also cover losses during your trip to your destination country like loss of baggage and passport, flight delays or cancellations and so on. Start by comparing features of the university-promoted policies with those of overseas student covers in India. The Indian travel policy must tick all the boxes to make sure it’s valid in your destination country. “Even if your university requires you to buy a policy through their tie-ups with local insurer, enquire whether you can buy an equivalent policy in India instead. In such cases, you might have to convince the university that you have adequate health insurance by furnishing your policy’s features and documents,” explains Nikhil Apte, Chief Product Officer - Product Factory (Health Insurance), Royal Sundaram General Insurance. Also read: Why buying overseas student travel insurance  is important Look for cheaper accommodation, factor in travel expenses Another important, non-discretionary expense is accommodation. “This would be one of the largest expenses, whether they are living within the campus or outside. In some universities and cities, there is no concept of campus with accommodation. So, you will have to spend on rent elsewhere. Students pursuing MBA, for instance, might have to stay in city centres for better networking opportunities. Then, they will have to spend on commuting to the campus and for various projects,” says Mayank Sharma, Country Head and Head of Global Partnerships, India, Prodigy Finance, a UK-headquartered education finance company. You will have to compare the rent in your university hostels with accommodation options outside the campus. To start with, however, experts recommend staying in university dormitories on the campus in your first year, even if it turns out to be more expensive. “This is especially true if you are an undergraduate student. At that age, they are more likely to be comfortable staying on the campus. They can look for cheaper accommodation elsewhere in the subsequent years once they are familiar with the locality,” suggests Nisreen Mamaji.  Keep a tight grip on other living expenses Besides course and accommodation fees, your living expenses budget will have to account for commuting expenses as also recurring expenses such as the cost of books, pens, calculators, regular grocery items, entertainment expenses and so on. For commuting, student discounts on travel passes will come in handy. “However, suppose you are an MBA student who has to live in a locality  that is not necessarily close to your university for the networking and paid internship opportunities it may offer. In such cases, your commuting expenses could be substantial,” explains Sharma. You can fund these expenses by taking up part-time assignments, which are easily available in most countries subject to student visa restrictions, say experts. But you should curb your urge to splurge. “Children should be taught to be prudent. For instance, they can plan their grocery shopping in advance and visit localities farther from their universities for cheaper bulk deals or supermarkets that offer discounts,” says Mamaji."

7,Agri Picks Report: Geojit,business," Geojit's report on Agri Picks India received 8.1 mm rainfall in the week ended yesterday, 19% above the normal of 6.8 mm for the period, data released by the India Meteorological Department showed. India has received 105.8 mm rainfall since Jun 1, which is adequate. Even before members of the Monetary Policy Committee convened on Jun 6, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, in a television interview, had termed a rate hike as a ""no-brainer"". Minutes of the latest policy meeting show that the same cannot be said about the subsequent rate decision, as members of the rate-setting panel believe that the economic recovery still needs to be nurtured.

8,Amazon has a plan to make Alexa mimic anyone's voice,business," The online retailer is developing a system to let Alexa mimic any voice after hearing less than a minute of audio, said Rohit Prasad, an Amazon senior vice president, at a conference the company held in Las Vegas Wednesday. The goal is to ""make the memories last"" after ""so many of us have lost someone we love"" during the pandemic, Prasad said. Amazon declined to share when it would roll out such a feature. The work wades into an area of technology that has garnered close scrutiny for potential benefits and abuses. For instance, Microsoft Corp recently restricted which businesses could use its software to parrot voices. The goal is to help people with speech impairments or other problems but some worry it could also be used to propagate political deepfakes. Amazon hopes the project will help Alexa become ubiquitous in shoppers' lives. But public attention has already shifted elsewhere. At Alphabet Inc's Google, an engineer made the highly contested claim that a company chat bot had advanced to sentience. Another Amazon executive said Tuesday that Alexa had 100 million customers globally, in line with figures the company has provided for device sales since January 2019. Prasad said Amazon's aim for Alexa is ""generalizable intelligence,"" or the ability to adapt to user environments and learn new concepts with little external input. He said that goal is ""not to be confused with the all-knowing, all-capable, uber artificial general intelligence,"" or AGI, which Alphabet's DeepMind unit and Elon Musk-co-founded OpenAI are seeking. Amazon shared its vision for companionship with Alexa at the conference. In a video segment, it portrayed a child who asked, ""Alexa, can grandma finish reading me the Wizard of Oz?"" A moment later, Alexa affirmed the command and changed her voice. She spoke soothingly, less robotically, ostensibly sounding like the individual's grandmother in real life."
9,"Daily Voice | Large cap space more attractively priced right now, expect migration from mid-small caps if volatility continues, says Abhay Agarwal of Piper Serica",business," ""In the most recent bout of correction we are finally seeing even long-term investors cutting their allocation to mid and small caps and moving to large caps. Right now the large cap space is more attractively priced and we expect this migration (from midcap and smallcaps) to continue if the markets stay volatile,"" Abhay Agarwal, Founder and Fund Manager at Piper Serica said in an interview to Moneycontrol. The recent correction has brought down the benchmarks to fresh 52-week lows as the sentiment remained subdued globally amid inflation concerns, growth worries, and policy tightening. He believes markets are already pricing in a lot of bad news and outcomes. There is consensus that inflation will continue to be sticky, interest rates will rise, USD will continue to strengthen, oil will get to $150 a barrel and Ukraine situation will not get resolved in a hurry. Edited excerpts from the interaction: Are we seeing capitulation in broader space as Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices already corrected 24 percent and 34 percent from record highs, compared to more than 17 percent fall in benchmarks? Yes, in the most recent bout of correction we are finally seeing even long-term investors cutting their allocation to mid and small caps and moving to large caps. The sharp correction of more than 50 percent in some of the leading mid and small caps has led to investors seeking the safety of large caps. The large cap space is more attractively priced right now when one considers greater certainty of earnings and cash flows. We expect this migration to continue if the markets stay volatile. Mid and small cap companies are also at a greater risk of earning downgrades. Predicting a bottom or top in the market is always difficult. But, considering current risk factors, do you think we are near the bottom? Markets are already pricing in a lot of bad news and outcomes. There is consensus that inflation will continue to be sticky, interest rates will rise, US dollar will continue to strengthen, oil will get to $150 a barrel and Ukraine situation will not get resolved in a hurry. A very high probability of recession and stagflation has now built into the models. Therefore, any positive surprise can provide a sharp turnaround to the market since there is a lot of under-ownership with cash sitting on the side-lines. Any long-term resolution of these key issues will help the market form a strong bottom at the current levels. Following the recent correction, have you spotted any segments that look really more attractive now? After a sharp correction, leading IT service providers and pharma exporters are looking quite attractive. Rupee depreciation is helping them protect their margins and enterprise customer demand continues to be robust. Lower attrition and salary cost stabilization will help IT service providers while the pharma companies are benefitting from customers looking for alternatives to China. Autos is another space that will benefit as steel prices cool off and supply chains for key components come back. The domestic demand is robust and a good monsoon will support rural demand especially for two wheelers. Do you think investors should now start increasing equity asset allocation in their portfolio? Our advice is that investors should stick to their asset allocation plan. The uncertain environment may create further bout of correction therefore it is best to refrain from bargain hunting or bottom fishing right now. However, investors should judiciously and in a systematic manner deploy new funds in case they are under allocated to equity in their portfolio. To override the market volatility, it would be best for investors to use a systematic transfer plan that moves funds from fixed income to equity every month over the next one year. This will allow the investors to normalize the market volatility. Do you think the risk of recession in the US and Europe turning into a ""reality"" now? While the central banks in the US and Europe are willing to tip their economy in a short-term recession to beat inflation it is not a popular political choice. Therefore, we expect the governments to continue to seek ways wherein inflation can be brought down without killing demand. Higher prices are already leading to sharp fall in consumer demand and down-trading in these economies and unless it is arrested soon the threat of recession becomes very real. There has been a softening of commodity prices recently and global trade from China has also opened. If that translates into lower inflation over the next couple of months, these countries may yet escape recession. But it will likely go to the wire.  After selling Rs 3.8 lakh crore worth shares so far since October 2021, are you hopeful that FIIs will return with substantial inflow in later part of this calendar year? The one-way selling by FPIs over the last 9 months has confounded everyone who expected the flows to reverse. With India still trading at a premium to rest of the emerging markets (EMs) it will be a difficult case for global asset allocators to allocate new capital to India despite its higher growth. We expect FPI flows to become positive only after the global markets stabilize and crude price corrects to well under $100 a barrel. At the same time we believe that the aggressive selling by FPIs is largely over and we will see a tapering of daily sale figure over the next couple of months."
10,"Berkshire Hathaway buys 9.6 millon more Occidental shares, raises stake to over 16%",business," Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc bought another 9.6 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp, boosting its stake to 16.3% as the oil company's shares come off the year's high. Following the purchases, Berkshire now owns about 152.7 million Occidental shares worth about $8.52 billion based on Occidental stock's Wednesday close, which is down over 21% since it touched its year's high in May. However, Occidental's share prices are currently up over 90% this year, after more than doubling, as they benefited from Berkshire's purchases and rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire is the largest individual shareholder in Occidental. The company also owns options to buy 83.9 million Occidental shares, which if exercised, would bring its stake to over 25%. Berkshire has been on a spending spree in 2022. It spent $51.1 billion on equities in the first quarter, including an increased $25.9 billion stake in oil company Chevron Corp. Analysts have viewed Occidental and Chevron as a way for Berkshire to benefit from rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine."
11,Elon Musk says Tesla's new car factories 'losing billions of dollars',business," Tesla Inc's new car factories in Texas and Berlin are ""losing billions of dollars"" as they struggle to increase production because of a shortage of batteries and China port issues, Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an interview published on Wednesday. ""Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now. Okay? It's really like a giant roaring sound, which is the sound of money on fire,"" Musk said in an interview with Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, an official Tesla-recognized club, in Austin, Texas, on May 31. The club divided its interview with Musk into three parts, the last of which was released on Wednesday. Musk said Tesla's Texas factory produces a ""tiny"" number of cars because of challenges in boosting production of its new ""4680"" batteries and as tools to make its conventional 2170 batteries are ""stuck in port in China."" ""This is all going to get fixed real fast, but it requires a lot of attention,"" he said. He said its Berlin factory is in a ""slightly better position"" because it started with using the traditional 2170 batteries for cars built there. SEEKING TO 'NOT GO BANKRUPT' He said the COVID-19-related shutdowns in Shanghai ""were very, very difficult."" The shutdown affected car production not only at Tesla's Shanghai factory, but also at its California plant, which uses some vehicle parts made in China, he said. Tesla plans to suspend most production at its Shanghai plant in the first two weeks of July to work on an upgrade of the site to boost output, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. ""The past two years have been an absolute nightmare of supply chain interruptions, one thing after another, and we're not out of it yet,"" Musk said. Tesla's overwhelming concern, he said, is ""How do we keep the factories operating so we can pay people and not go bankrupt?"" Musk said early this month he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and that the company needed to cut staff by about 10% and ""pause all hiring worldwide."" Earlier this week, he said a 10% cut in salaried staff at Tesla will occur over three months. Tesla earlier this year started production at the factories in Berlin and Texas, both of which are critical to the growth ambitions of the top electric car maker. Musk said he expected Tesla would start production of its Cybertruck electric pickup trucks, which has been delayed, in mid-2023."
12,Chart of the Day: Hurtling towards a wide current account deficit,business,"  India’s current account deficit (CAD) for FY22 widened to $38.7 billion or 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from $23.7 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in FY21. The wider deficit is on expected lines as a surge in global oil prices inflated the petroleum and oil bill for the economy during the year. As a result, the trade deficit widened sharply by $185.5 billion. Since oil prices are likely to remain elevated, economists expect the CAD to widen further in the coming year. What’s more is that the odds of a recession in the US have risen which could dampen the prospects for exports as the country remains the biggest export destination for Indian goods and services."
13,Buy EURINR; target of : 82.70: ICICI Direct,business," ICICI Direct's currency report on EURINR The Euro edged higher by 0.32% on Wednesday amid weak US dollar. Further, the Euro was supported by the statement of German finance minister Christian Lindner, as he urged the European Central Bank on Wednesday to take swift action to get inflation under control. However, sharp upside was capped by weak German bond yields • The Euro is expected to trade with a positive bias today amid weakness in dollar. However, investors will remain vigilant ahead of Euro area services PMI data and manufacturing PMI data, as services PMI data is expected to fall from 56.1 to 55.5 and manufacturing PMI data is expected to fall from 54.6 to 53.9. EURUSD is expected to surpass the hurdle of 1.0620 to continue its upward trend towards the level of 1.0680. EURINR is likely to trade in the range of 82.20 to 82.70.

14,Gold dips after Fed chief reaffirms inflation fight,business," Gold prices inched lower on Thursday, pressured by expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes after the U.S. Federal Reserve chief doubled down on the central bank's fight against inflation. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,832.91 per ounce by 0239 GMT. U.S. gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,834.30. ""With (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell pointing out overnight that 1% rises were a real possibility, it's a reminder of that constant pressure on gold prices from rising interest rates,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategy officer at Tiger Brokers, Australia. When asked by a member of the Senate Banking Committee if the Fed could raise rates by as much as 100 basis points at once, Powell said he would never take anything off the table, and officials would make whatever moves were needed to restore price stability. Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven during economic crises, like recession, but saw some gains after Powell's statement as Treasury yields bore the brunt of it. [US/] Higher interest rates and bond yields raise the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which yields no interest. Powell is due to testify again in Washington D.C. later on Thursday. ""Gold is expected to follow the commodity complex down. It is more likely for gold to trade below $1,800/oz in the next two weeks than not,"" said Michael Langford, director at corporate advisory AirGuide. ""Gold is crypto for (Baby) Boomers, it has no meaningful industrial usage and is a psychological store of value much in the same way crypto was for the younger generation."" The dollar steadied at elevated levels after some losses in the previous session, limiting demand for greenback-priced bullion among buyers holding other currencies. [USD/]"
15,"Telcos may buy spectrum worth Rs 71,000 crore in 5G auction: IIFL",business," The three private telecom operators -- Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea -- are expected to buy spectrum worth Rs 71,000 crore in the upcoming auction, leaving a vast majority of the radiowaves going under the hammer unsold, according to research firm IIFL Securities. The government will next month auction about Rs 4.3 lakh crore worth of airwaves capable of offering fifth-generation or 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet. According to the report released on Wednesday, the government's in-principle nod to allocate spectrum directly to enterprises is going to have an adverse outcome of the mega auction. ""While supply is abundant, the government has not cut TRAI's proposed reserve prices despite telcos' assertion that these were still high. We see telcos bidding only for 4 of the 10 bands and spectrum should be sold at base price. We estimate spectrum outlay of Rs 37500 crore, Rs 25000 crore and Rs 8500 crore for Jio, Bharti and Vi,"" IIFL said. The research firm further said if all telecom operators avail the option of equal annual installments over 20 years, the government would receive Rs 6,200 proceeds in the current financial year. It said telcos may give the premium 700 MHz band spectrum a miss as they await further reserve-price cuts. Jio and Bharti may bolster their sub-1 GHz holdings by bidding for the 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands, respectively. ""We do not assume any bids in the 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands. Bids for 3.6 GHz are somewhat tricky to predict,"" it said. The report further said telcos could bid for small quantities in the 3.6 GHz and 28 GHz bandd -- seen as the prime radiowaves for 5G technology -- as it can lead to large savings in spectrum usage charges."
16,Allsec Technologies to merge with Quess Corp in all stock deal,business," Business process outsourcing firm Allsec Technologies will merge with technology-enabled staffing and outsourcing services firm Quess Corp in an all-stock deal, the companies said in a joint statement. Upon the scheme becoming effective, all the subsidiaries of Allsec will become subsidiaries of Quess.

Public shareholders of Allsec will receive 74 shares of Quess for every 100 shares held in Allsec."
17,Spandana agrees to resolve disputes with ex-MD Padmaja Gangireddy amicably,business," Microfinance company Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited has resolved issues with its promoter and erstwhile MD Padmaja Gangireddy and they have agreed to settle all disputes amicably. The board of directors of the company and its subsidiaries -- Criss Financial Limited and Caspian Financial Services Limited -- on Tuesday approved the settlement agreement, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. A settlement agreement has been entered into between the company and the erstwhile MD of the company. Reddy had resigned from her position as the Managing Director of the company on November 2, 2021. Following this, certain disputes arose between her and the board of directors of the company. ""We...inform you that the company and Reddy have resolved their differences and agreed to part ways on amicable terms,"" according to a joint statement. It said while Reddy is no longer serving as the MD of the company, she continues to be a substantial shareholder and member of the company's board. ""Needless to state that the company and its board reiterate that they are committed to growing the company's business with a view to take it to greater heights,"" according to the statement."
18,The cost of investing in the wrong product can far exceed the investment advisor fees you think you saved on,business," The cost of investing in the wrong financial products is a lot higher than the cost of getting professional investment advice. That might sound a bit odd but it isn’t. And we will see why. Most Indians don’t want to pay for proper investment advice. They believe that financial advice (unlike medical or legal), should be free. There is also the belief that product sellers such as insurance agents, etc., who claim to offer free advice, are sufficient to propel your investments in the right direction. Nothing could be further from the truth. And I will show this with an example I recently came across. The fallout of investing in the wrong financial product A family friend has been paying about Rs 1.2 lakh as annual premium for LIC’s traditional endowment policy. He has been doing this for the last seven years. The policy tenure is 28 years, so there are about 21 more years for the policy to mature. We tried to explain that traditional insurance (endowment) plans are not good investments for the long term. Remember, his policy’s tenure is 28 years. Such policies also give mere 4-5% returns. This pales when you compare it with equity investment returns, which were in the region of around 10-11% over the same period. Also read: Why traditional life insurance isn't a good long-term investment? My friend doesn’t have an investment advisor to guide him. Why? Because, he says, he doesn’t believe in paying a fee for financial advice. And he also was not sure whether the advisor’s fee would be worth the advice given. Are financial advisors really that costly? I took a piece of paper and showed him that his Rs 1.2 lakh annual premium in an endowment plan (which was the wrong product to be in) for 28 years will result in a maturity payout of close to Rs 75-80 lakh. Looking at just that absolute number, he said it was a big amount. But when I showed him that the same Rs 1.2 lakh annual investment instead in equity funds could have generated almost Rs 1.8-2 crore, he did not believe me at first. He was a bit shocked to see how the difference between the two could be so large (Rs 73 lakh vs Rs 1.8-2 crore). I explained a bit about equity returns. More importantly, I showed him how one single piece of right and timely advice from an investment advisor (even though it comes for a fee) would have helped him invest in the right product from the start. And as a result, he would have a lot more money later on than he would have had without that advisory intervention. People are willing to invest in the wrong product but don’t want to pay a small fee to know better. One reason for this is that many people don’t even know how to evaluate their investments properly, leave alone plan for their financial goals. Also read: When should you approach a financial advisor? Do you need a financial advisor? Some people know how to manage their investments properly and choose the right products. They are what can be called the small-but-growing DIY (do it yourself) investor community. But there is a very large number of people who do not know how to pick the right products, how much to invest regularly to achieve their goals, how much insurance to have, etc. A timely, unbiased and objective professional advisory intervention can be the difference between them meeting or missing their financial goals. These people will also show patterns in their investment decisions that are obvious signs of the need to have an investment advisor. I have said this often but will repeat it: the cost of investing in the wrong products is very high; and the cost of investing in the wrong assets can be disastrous for your financial goals."

We have collated a list of important headlines across news platforms which could impact Indian as well as international markets: US Markets Major US stock indexes ended down slightly Wednesday, losing early gains tied to remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the US central bank is ""strongly committed"" to bringing down inflation, while sharply lower oil prices weighed on energy shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.12 points, or 0.15%, to 30,483.13, the S&P 500 lost 4.9 points, or 0.13%, to 3,759.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.22 points, or 0.15%, to 11,053.08.

Oil extends losses as recession fears mount Oil prices fell 2% in early trade on Thursday, extending losses from the previous day, as investors worried that aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes could trigger a recession and dent fuel demand. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $2.39, or 2.3%, to $103.80 a barrel by 0031 GMT. Brent crude futures dropped $2.24, or 2.0%, to $109.50 a barrel. India's January-March current account deficit falls to $13.4 billion; FY22 CAD at three-year high India's current account deficit (CAD) fell to $13.4 billion in January-March 2022 from $22.2 billion in October-December 2021, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 22. The deficit was $8.1 billion in January-March 2021. In percentage terms, the CAD in January-March 2022 was 1.5 percent of GDP, down from 2.6 percent of GDP the previous quarter. ""The sequential decline in CAD in Q4:2021-22 (January-March) was mainly on account of a moderation in trade deficit and lower net outgo of primary income,"" the central bank said. India's merchandise trade deficit fell to $54.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022 from $59.8 billion the previous quarter, helping bring down the CAD. Committed to inflation fight, not trying to trigger recession: Fed's Jerome Powell The Federal Reserve is not trying to engineer a recession to stop inflation but is fully committed to bringing prices under control even if doing so risks an economic downturn, U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. ""We are not trying to provoke, and I don't think we will need to provoke, a recession,"" Powell said at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, although he acknowledged that a recession was ""certainly a possibility"" and events in the last few months around the world had made it more difficult to reduce inflation without causing one. ""It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all,"" Powell said. The Fed in coming months will be looking for ""compelling evidence"" of slowing price pressures before it eases up on the interest rate increases it kicked off three months ago. Domestic air traffic jumps 11% sequentially in May to 1.2 crore: DGCA Domestic air passenger traffic jumped to 1.2 crore in May 2022, marking a surge of 11 percent as compared to the preceding month, as per the data shared by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on June 22.

In the past month, IndiGo's passenger load factor increased to 81 percent, as against 78.7 percent in April 2022. SpiceJet's passenger load factor climbed to 89.1 percent in May 2022 from 85.9 percent in the preceding month.

20,BMW starts production at new $2.2 billion China plant to ramp up EV output,business," Germany's BMW said on Thursday that production has formally begun at a new plant in China with an investment of 15 billion yuan ($2.24 billion) as the carmaker accelerates electric vehicle (EV) production. The Lydia plant, BMW's third car assembly facility in China, located in the northeastern city of Shenyang, Liaoning province, will increase BMW's annual output in the world's biggest auto market to 830,000 vehicles from 700,0000 in 2021, the company said. The plant is designed to be capable of producing battery-powered electric cars only according to market demand on its flexible manufacturing lines, BMW said. The first model that will roll off the Lydia plant's production lines is the i3, a pure electric mid-sized sports sedan, BMW said, increasing the range of its EV models for Chinese customers to 13 next year. Tesla and Chinese automakers such as BYD dominate the booming EV market in China, with sales more than doubling from a year ago. Meanwhile kings of the internal combustion engine age such as General Motors and Volkswagen are falling behind. Nearly a quarter of the cars sold in China in the first five months of this year were powered by batteries, according to data from China Association of Automotive Manufactures."
21,"Asia shares struggle, oil falls as recession fears linger",business," Asian shares wobbled while commodity prices fell on Thursday as mounting worries about the risks of a global recession amid aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve kept broad investor sentiment fragile. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed earlier gains to be mostly flat in Asia trade. Stocks in South Korea were off, while Japan's Nikkei was broadly unchanged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6%, following the news that Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired a top-level meeting on Wednesday that approved a plan for the healthy development of China's large payment firms and fintech sector. Overnight, the dollar fell alongside U.S. Treasury yields after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, acknowledged a recession was ""certainly a possibility"", but the Fed is not trying to engineer one. A Reuters poll showed the Fed will deliver another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, and won't scale back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest. ""What is clear is the market views a recession as increasingly likely, a view heard from Powell, who detailed that a recession was a possibility but not their intention,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne. ""Equities have held in well despite the falls in commodities, altogether there has been rotation into low-risk areas of the market and defensive sectors, with predictable outflows from energy and materials stock."" U.S. stocks reversed earlier gains and ended the session slightly down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 lost 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.15%. Investors are continuing to assess the risks of central banks pushing the world economy into recession as they attempt to curb inflation with interest rate increases. Concerns about the demand outlook have sapped commodity prices, with oil on Thursday falling to the lowest level in more than a month. Brent crude was down 2% to $109.49 per barrel and U.S. crude declined 2.3% to $103.75 a barrel. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down slightly in early trade to 3.1430%, the lowest in almost two weeks, compared with its U.S. close of 3.156% the previous day. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 3.0391% compared with a U.S. close of 3.056%. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar eased 0.1% against a basket of major currencies, following a 0.2% fall the previous session. However, the index was up more than 8% this year, reflecting the broad risk-off sentiment and the dollar's Fed-driven yield advantage. Those factors were underscored by the South Korean won, which fell below a psychological threshold of 1,300 per dollar for the first time in 13 years, amid global economic recession worries."

0,BMW starts production at new $2.2 billion China plant to ramp up EV output,business," Germany's BMW said on Thursday that production has formally begun at a new plant in China with an investment of 15 billion yuan ($2.24 billion) as the carmaker accelerates electric vehicle (EV) production. The Lydia plant, BMW's third car assembly facility in China, located in the northeastern city of Shenyang, Liaoning province, will increase BMW's annual output in the world's biggest auto market to 830,000 vehicles from 700,0000 in 2021, the company said. The plant is designed to be capable of producing battery-powered electric cars only according to market demand on its flexible manufacturing lines, BMW said. The first model that will roll off the Lydia plant's production lines is the i3, a pure electric mid-sized sports sedan, BMW said, increasing the range of its EV models for Chinese customers to 13 next year. Tesla and Chinese automakers such as BYD dominate the booming EV market in China, with sales more than doubling from a year ago. Meanwhile kings of the internal combustion engine age such as General Motors and Volkswagen are falling behind. Nearly a quarter of the cars sold in China in the first five months of this year were powered by batteries, according to data from China Association of Automotive Manufactures."
1,"Asia shares struggle, oil falls as recession fears linger",business," Asian shares wobbled while commodity prices fell on Thursday as mounting worries about the risks of a global recession amid aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve kept broad investor sentiment fragile. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed earlier gains to be mostly flat in Asia trade. Stocks in South Korea were off, while Japan's Nikkei was broadly unchanged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6%, following the news that Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired a top-level meeting on Wednesday that approved a plan for the healthy development of China's large payment firms and fintech sector. Overnight, the dollar fell alongside U.S. Treasury yields after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, acknowledged a recession was ""certainly a possibility"", but the Fed is not trying to engineer one. A Reuters poll showed the Fed will deliver another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, and won't scale back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest. ""What is clear is the market views a recession as increasingly likely, a view heard from Powell, who detailed that a recession was a possibility but not their intention,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne. ""Equities have held in well despite the falls in commodities, altogether there has been rotation into low-risk areas of the market and defensive sectors, with predictable outflows from energy and materials stock."" U.S. stocks reversed earlier gains and ended the session slightly down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 lost 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.15%. Investors are continuing to assess the risks of central banks pushing the world economy into recession as they attempt to curb inflation with interest rate increases. Concerns about the demand outlook have sapped commodity prices, with oil on Thursday falling to the lowest level in more than a month. Brent crude was down 2% to $109.49 per barrel and U.S. crude declined 2.3% to $103.75 a barrel. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down slightly in early trade to 3.1430%, the lowest in almost two weeks, compared with its U.S. close of 3.156% the previous day. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 3.0391% compared with a U.S. close of 3.056%. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar eased 0.1% against a basket of major currencies, following a 0.2% fall the previous session. However, the index was up more than 8% this year, reflecting the broad risk-off sentiment and the dollar's Fed-driven yield advantage. Those factors were underscored by the South Korean won, which fell below a psychological threshold of 1,300 per dollar for the first time in 13 years, amid global economic recession worries."
2,GST council to consider sales tax on cryptocurrency next week,business," An Indian ministerial panel will meet next week to discuss a goods and services tax on cryptocurrency transactions, people with knowledge on the matter said. The panel, comprising federal and states’ finance ministers, is seeking to broaden the tax net to track dealings in virtual digital assets in a more effective manner, the people said, declining to be identified citing rules on speaking with media. The panel is meeting for two days starting June 28 in the northern Indian state of Chandigarh. The panel is unlikely to finalize a rate in the upcoming meeting but discussions may be held on placing it in the highest tax slab of 28%, the people said. A finance ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to calls seeking comments. Earlier this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman imposed a levy of 30% on income from transfer of virtual assets and a 1% tax at source on all crypto transactions in a bid to assess the size of crypto market in the country and track users. The move was seen as removing uncertainty about the legal status of crypto transactions. However, there is still no clarity on imposition of a sales tax on digital currencies due to ambiguity in its treatment as goods or services and a lack of a regulatory framework. The federal government is already working on a legislation to either regulate or tighten provisions though it is expected only after a global consensus emerges on regulating such assets, Bloomberg had earlier reported."
3,Latest meme stock Revlon surges more than 50% in heavy trading,business," Shares of the $330 million market-cap company, which filed for bankruptcy last Wednesday, are up more than 400% since its lows on June 14 as retail investors appear to pile in to the company. Overall, shares of Revlon were the second-most traded by brokerage customers of Fidelity on Wednesday, following only the shares of Tesla Inc, according to the firm. The firm's market cap was less than $100 million before its recent surge, one of the features that made it the ""perfect candidate for the most speculative retail cohort,"" according to Vanda Research. Retail traders bought $8.3 million worth of Revlon shares on Tuesday, the highest ever recorded for the stock, Vanda said. In late afternoon trading on Wednesday, the stock was up 48% at $8.98 after rising more than 50% earlier. The rally was reminiscent of the more than 500% surge in the shares of car rental firm Hertz Corp after it filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 following economic restrictions during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Vanda estimated that short interest in Revlon stood at 37.6% earlier this week, making it an attractive target for retail traders who have in the past piled in to stocks in order to force a short squeeze - an unwind of bearish bets that occurs when a stock price rapidly rises and can exacerbate gains in a company's shares. However, such an unwind is likely not the driver of Revlon's recent move higher, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at research firm S3 Partners. ""The recent price moves are due to long buying and selling and not short selling and covering – in other words, a meme stock,"" he said. Short sellers are down $15.3 million in mark-to-market losses, or 139%, for the month of June, according to S3 Partners. Shares of Revlon are down 22% for the year to date."

5,Bidders weigh offers valuing Toshiba at up to $22 billion: Sources,business," Toshiba, which is exploring strategic options, said this month it had received eight initial buyout proposals and two for capital alliances that would see it remain listed. The bidders are now discussing an offer price range of up to 7,000 yen a share with Toshiba's shareholders, the people said, representing up to a 27% premium to Toshiba's share price of 5,501 yen as of Wednesday's close. A separate source said the range of offers was wide and various conditions have been attached. Toshiba shares rose 5.3% in Tokyo early on Thursday, outperforming a 0.8% rise in the benchmark Nikkei average. The offer price, if finalised, would value the chips-to-nuclear-reactors conglomerate at 3 trillion yen ($22 billion) at top end of the range. Toshiba told Reuters it would not disclose details of the proposals. KKR & Co Inc, Baring Private Equity Asia, Blackstone Inc, Bain Capital, Brookfield Asset Management, MBK Partners, Apollo Global Management and CVC Capital Partners have submitted initial bids, according to the people. Some of them may form consortia for a bid, they added. Bain, Blackstone, Brookfield, Baring, CVC, KKR and MBK declined to comment. Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Domestic funds, including Japan Investment Corp (JIC), and a number of strategic players are looking to see how they can participate in the deal, the people said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media. JIC declined to comment. WEAK YEN If successful, the Toshiba deal would be largest buyout transaction in Japan since a consortium led by Bain took private the conglomerate's memory chip unit, Kioxia, for $18 billion in 2018. The discussions are taking place at a time when a weak yen continues to haunt the Japanese economy, threatening to disrupt Japanese firms' business plans and turn them into attractive acquisition targets for foreign buyers. The yen plunged to a new 24-year low of 136.71 per dollar early on Wednesday. Of all the potential bidders, Bain has been ""very aggressive"" in pushing for a buyout, said two of the people. A Japanese investment banker with knowledge of the deal separately said even at 6,500 yen per share the valuation for Toshiba seemed ""too stretched"". Ultimately, he said, the price would have to take into account how investors value Toshiba's 40% stake in unlisted chipmaker Kioxia. That gave Bain an advantage over other bidders, he said, because the private equity firm owned the bulk of Kioxia, meaning it would decide the fate of the chipmaker, which in turn would impact the valuation of Toshiba. Bedevilled by accounting and governance crises since 2015, Toshiba set up a special committee in April to solicit proposals after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan. The company said earlier it would shortlist bidders for due diligence after its annual shareholders' meeting on June 28."
6,JPMorgan starts cutting jobs in mortgage unit as homebuying demand cools,business," More than 1,000 employees will be affected and about half of them will be moved to different divisions within the bank, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the layoffs. ""Our staffing decision this week was a result of cyclical changes in the mortgage market,"" a spokesperson for the biggest U.S. bank said. JPMorgan has 273,948 employees worldwide, according to its latest quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""We were able to proactively move many impacted employees to new roles within the firm and are working to help the remaining affected employees find new employment within Chase and externally,"" the spokesperson added. Last week, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest increase since 1994, after official data just a few days earlier showed inflation rose despite expectations it had peaked. Real estate brokers Compass Inc and Redfin Corp also said last week they would cut jobs as homebuying demand was slowing due to rising mortgage rates and surging inflation. In May, U.S. existing home sales tumbled to a two-year low as median house prices jumped to a record high - topping the $400,000 mark for the first time."
7,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with Matrimony, Sterling Tools, IOL Chemicals, ITI, Trident on Thursday?",business," The market failed to extend its positive momentum seen in previous session as weak global sentiment and selling pressure in every sector pulled benchmark indices down on June 22. The BSE Sensex fell more than 700 points to 51,823 and the Nifty50 plunged more than 200 points to 15,413 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on daily charts. The Stochastic has given a negative crossover, clearly indicating that sentiments are weak at the moment, while the India VIX, which gauges the expected volatility in the market, remained above 20 levels, suggesting continuity in volatile swings in the market and the trend could remain in favour of bears. The VIX rose by 0.74 percent to 21.30 levels. Broader markets also reeled under pressure after a sharp rebound in the previous session. The Nifty Midcap 100 index declined 1.6 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell 1.4 percent as about five shares declined for every two advancing shares on the NSE. But there were several stocks that outperformed the broader space in the falling markets including ITI which surged 17 percent to Rs 104, Matrimony which gained 6.7 percent at Rs 823, Sterling Tools which climbed 6 percent to Rs 238.5, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals which rose 3.3 percent to Rs 321, and Trident which jumped 4.4 percent to Rs 38. Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Sterling Tools On the weekly chart, the counter is near resistance levels of approximately Rs 260. Over the last couple of years, the stock has been rejected two times from Rs 260 levels, so one should wait for any fresh buying as of now. If already holding position, then one should book some profits at current market price. Last but not the least fresh buying in the counter will only trigger once it successfully closes above Rs 260 and settles in.  Trident At current juncture, Trident is in crucial support zone of Rs 35-36 (see chart). Moreover, at the said levels, we have seen Bullish Engulfing which was made on June 21 along with volume picking up and it is a sign of positive momentum. One should buy, hold and add at current market price with upside potential till Rs 45 with downside support of Rs 35.  Matrimony Matrimony has given nice upmove in the last session but the major hurdle of Rs 878 is still intact. From Ichimoku Cloud point of view, the stock is above cloud which is a positive sign but T-K cross is not visible clearly. So one should wait for Matrimony to close above Rs 878 and settle in, then only fresh buy will trigger.  IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals The counter has corrected almost 60 percent from its recent high of Rs 537 in April. At current juncture, the stock is taking support near potential reversal zone (Rs 310-325) of bullish bat pattern. Moreover, we are getting extra confirmation from Bullish Harami candlestick pattern which was made on June 21. One can buy this at current levels with upside potential of Rs 380 and downside support is at Rs 295.  ITI In the previous session we witnessed massive rally of 17 percent. Though upmove is massive but on weekly chart there is a lot of resistance seen from Rs 106-115. No fresh buying is advised if you are holding this; start booking in the range of Rs 110 -115 because we may witness strong selling pressure from resistance levels. "

Over 35 lakh people are eligible to vote in the bypolls and will be deciding the fate of 19 candidates. The bypolls to the Azamgarh seat were necessitated by the resignation of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, who was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly as an MLA in the elections earlier this year. The Rampur seat was vacated by senior SP leader Azam Khan, who too was elected to the state Assembly. The polling started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm, the office of the Chief Electoral Officer said here. According to an official statement issued here by the Election Commission, two general and as many expense observers have been deputed by it to keep an eye on the polls. Besides, 291 sector magistrates, 40 zonal magistrates and 433 micro-observers have also been deputed, it said. For ensuring security and peaceful conduct of the polls, adequate number of central and state forces have been deployed. The responsibility for the security of EVMs and strongrooms has been given to central forces.

10,Bangladesh tries to secure wheat from Russia as India stops exports: Sources,business," Bangladesh is trying to secure wheat supplies from Russia in a government-to-government deal after it's biggest supplier India banned exports of the grain last month to contain local prices, government and trade officials told Reuters on Wednesday. The supply deal with Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter, could help Dhaka in meeting its needs below the elevated global prices, industry officials said. Bangladesh is holding a virtual meeting with Russia on Thursday to finalise the deal, said a senior official with Bangladesh's food ministry. ""We'll initially seek at least 200,000 tonnes of wheat from Russia,"" said the official, who declined to be named. The Ministry of Food did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bangladesh imports around 7 million tonnes of wheat and last year more than-two thirds of that came from India. After India's export ban, Bangladesh tried to secure supplies via international tenders but has cancelled them because of high prices. Bangladesh was paying less than $400 per tonne on the cost and freight basis for Indian wheat, but after the ban other suppliers started quoting above $460, which raised local prices in Bangladesh, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. The Bangladesh government is struggling to contain soaring commodity prices, with inflation at an eight-year high in May, while the country's wheat stocks hit their lowest in three years at 166,000 tonnes. ""There are many countries who can supply wheat to Bangladesh, but key issue is price. Russia can offer discount over global prices,"" said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm. But paying for Russian wheat would be a challenge for Dhaka given Western sanctions on Moscow. ""All the issues, including payment, will be discussed in the meeting. Let's see,"" the government official said."
11,Tesla plans 2-week suspension for most Shanghai production for upgrade,business," Tesla Inc plans to suspend most production at its Shanghai plant in the first two weeks of July to work on an upgrade of the site, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. After the upgrade, the U.S. automaker aims to boost the plant's output to a new record high by the end of July to get closer to its goal of producing 22,000 cars per week in Shanghai, according to the memo. A two-month-long COVID lockdown in Shanghai delayed Tesla's original plan of reaching production of 8,000 Model 3s and 14,000 Model Ys per week at the Shanghai plant by mid May, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters previously. The Shanghai factory has been churning out 17,000 Model 3 and Model Y cars per week since mid June, according to previous memos seen by Reuters. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""Our constraints are much more in raw materials and being able to scale up production,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the Qatar Economic Forum organised by Bloomberg on Tuesday. ""We are increasing production capacity as fast as humanly possible,"" he added. Production at the Tesla Shanghai factory is on track to fall by over a third this quarter from the first three months of the year as China's zero-COVID lockdowns caused deeper disruptions to output than Musk had predicted. Last year, Tesla's China-made cars, which were sold locally and to overseas markets such as Europe and Australia, accounted for around half of the 936,000 vehicles it delivered globally, based on Reuters calculations using China Passenger Car Association data. Customers in Australia now have to wait until the first quarter of 2023 for their Model Ys while those in Europe can only pick up their cars at the earliest in the fourth quarter of this year, its website showed."
12,"Sun TV Network, 2 others on NSE ban list for F&O trade today",business," Media company Sun TV Network has been added to the list of stocks that are under the F&O ban for June 23 by the National Stock Exchange after the stock crossed 95 percent of the market-wide position limit. Sun TV has seen the highest short build-up among 122 stocks, which corrected nearly 9 percent to close at Rs 408.6 amid high volumes on the NSE. On the technical front, it has seen a formation of large bearish candle as the closing was way lower than opening levels. Indiabulls Housing Finance and RBL Bank are already on the list even as the former fell 3 percent to Rs 98.9 and the latter gained nearly 3 percent at Rs 85.55. If derivative contracts in a security cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, they end up on the ban list, the NSE said. “All clients/members shall trade in the derivative contracts of the said security only to decrease their positions through offsetting positions. Any increase in open positions shall attract appropriate penal and disciplinary action,” it said. During the ban, traders are not allowed to take fresh positions in stocks but can start reducing their positions. The F&O ban rule helps reduce speculation in stocks. The market-wide position limit, which is set by stock exchanges, is the maximum number of outstanding open positions (buy and sell) in the F&O contracts of a security. If the open interest in a stock crosses 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, its F&O contracts enter the ban period."

15,Russian momentum in Ukraine could slow for lack of resources: British PM Boris Johnson,business," Britain's defence intelligence service believes that Russia's momentum in the war in Ukraine will slow in the next few months as its army exhausts its resources, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a group of European newspapers. In comments released on Wednesday by Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Johnson said President Vladimir Putin's forces were pushing forward in the eastern Donbas region, wreaking destruction but at a heavy cost in soldiers and weapons. ""Our defence intelligence service believes, however, that in the next few months, Russia could come to a point at which there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources,"" Johnson was quoted as saying in the interview. ""Then we must help the Ukrainians to reverse the dynamic. I will argue for this at the Group of Seven summit (in Germany at the weekend),"" he said. ""In as much as the Ukrainians are in a position to start a counter-offensive, it should be supported. With equipment that they demand from us,"" he said. Asked what a victory for Ukraine, or failure for Putin, would look like, Johnson said: ""That we at least regain the status quo that was there before Feb. 24 and that its (Russia's) troops are repulsed from the areas they invaded""."

The long-form feature is being tested by a small group of writers and Twitter did not give more details on its wider roll-out. The company currently has a 280-character limit on tweets, a feature it began testing nearly five years ago.

The company is in the middle of a $44 billion buyout by Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest person according to Forbes magazine."
17,BlackBerry investors oppose Prem Watsa’s re-election as a director,business," Shareholders of BlackBerry Ltd. rebuked the board and major shareholder Prem Watsa, rejecting the company’s executive compensation plan and voting in large numbers against Watsa’s re-election as a director. Watsa received just 50.7% support at the Canadian software company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. That means, excluding the 46.7 million shares controlled by Watsa’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., shareholders representing a majority of the votes at the meeting opposed him. BlackBerry investors also voted 56% against the company’s compensation plan in a so-called “say on pay” resolution. That was up from 41% opposition in a similar vote last year. BlackBerry was briefly caught up in last year’s meme-stock craze -- the shares more than doubled in January 2021 -- before giving up those gains. The shares remain lower than they were when John Chen took over as chief executive officer in 2013 with a plan to focus on software instead of smartphones. On a personal level, the vote is a blow for Watsa, a legend in Canada’s financial community for his success in following Warren Buffett’s approach to value investing. From a corporate perspective, it’s the latest in a series of milestones marking BlackBerry’s long descent. Once the dominant player in smartphones, die-hard fans of BlackBerry devices, including Barack Obama, weren’t enough to save the company from a series of missteps and relentless competition from Apple Inc. At its peak the company had a stock market value of about C$85 billion ($66 billion); today it’s C$4 billion. Shareholders’ discontent stems in part from the tens of millions of dollars in stock awards Chen has received over the years, even as the company struggled to grow. The temporary rise in the share price during the meme-stock rally meant that Chen received performance share units, or PSUs, despite its subsequent tumble. Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. both recommended that investors vote against the say-on-pay plan. The compensation vote is advisory, meaning it isn’t binding on the board. In February, Chen filed a plan with regulators to sell as many as 2.9 million shares of BlackBerry, or nearly a third of his holdings, for “personal financial planning purposes.”"
18,"Committed to inflation fight, not trying to trigger recession: Fed's Jerome Powell",business," The Federal Reserve is not trying to engineer a recession to stop inflation but is fully committed to bringing prices under control even if doing so risks an economic downturn, U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. ""We are not trying to provoke, and I don't think we will need to provoke, a recession,"" Powell said at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, although he acknowledged that a recession was ""certainly a possibility"" and events in the last few months around the world had made it more difficult to reduce inflation without causing one. ""It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all,"" Powell said. The Fed in coming months will be looking for ""compelling evidence"" of slowing price pressures before it eases up on the interest rate increases it kicked off three months ago. Inflation continues to run at least three times higher than the Fed's targeted level of 2%. A gauge of price increases that excludes volatile food and energy costs may have eased somewhat last month, Powell testified, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdowns in China are putting continued upward pressure on inflation. One week ago, the Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest hike since 1994 - to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%, and signaled rates would rise to 3.4% by the end of this year. That steep rate hike path, designed to slow the economy, has sparked widespread concern about a recession and a weakening of labor markets, which Powell on Wednesday said were unsustainably hot. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated that ongoing increases in the Fed's policy rate would be appropriate, with the exact pace dependent on the economic outlook. He declined to rule out a 100-basis-point move if it proved warranted. ""Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store,"" he said, repeating that policymakers would need to be nimble in response to the incoming data. 'COUGHING UP BONES' Since the June 14-15 policy meeting, a number of Powell's fellow policymakers have lined up behind his comments last week that the central bank will very likely need to raise rates by either 50 or 75 basis points at its next meeting in July. Earlier on Wednesday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said incoming data would govern which of the two options to deliver. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans signaled later on Wednesday that he also is comfortable for now with continued rapid rate hikes, even as he nodded to the rising recession risk. ""To think that we can fine tune something like this with tremendous precision -- I mean, we just don't have that ability,"" Evans said. Even so, he added, there's ""tremendous"" consensus at the Fed for getting rates into modestly restrictive territory. ""The first thing that we're looking at is to make sure we take the steam out of the inflation pressures,"" he said. But in an indication of how inflation has emerged as a thorny political issue that threatens to tip the balance of power in Congress to Republicans in elections this November, Powell found himself under fire from both the left and right. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat representing Massachusetts, took the Fed to task for pushing through rate hikes that raised the risk of a recession that could put millions out of work. Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, in one of the more heated criticisms of the Fed's response to inflation, said inflation was hitting his constituents ""so hard they are coughing up bones."" Overall, Powell did not stray far from his remarks in his news conference that followed the Fed's latest policy meeting, but his assertion that financial conditions had ""tightened significantly"" seems significant and may herald a slower pace of rate hikes, Karim Basta, chief economist at III Capital Management, wrote in a note. Interest rate futures ticked higher through the course of Powell's appearance, as traders moderated expectations for additional big rate increases at the Fed's remaining four policy meetings of the year. Economists polled by Reuters before the appearance see the Fed delivering another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, with no scaling back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest. Fed officials' latest projections see economic growth slowing to below trend this year while the U.S. unemployment rate - currently 3.6% - starts to tick higher. Meanwhile, they now expect inflation by year-end to drop only to 5.2% by their preferred measure, which registered 6.3% as of April."

21,Russian oil tankers get India safety cover via Dubai company,business," India is providing safety certification for dozens of ships managed by a subsidiary of top Russian shipping group Sovcomflot, official data showed, enabling oil exports to India and elsewhere after Western certifiers withdrew their services due to global sanctions against Moscow. Certification by the Indian Register of Shipping (IRClass), one of the world's top classification companies, provides a final link in the paperwork chain - after insurance coverage - needed to keep state-owned Sovcomflot's tanker fleet afloat and delivering Russian crude oil to overseas markets. Data compiled from the IRClass website shows that it has certified more than 80 ships managed by SCF Management Services (Dubai) Ltd, a Dubai-based entity listed as a subsidiary on Sovcomflot's website. An Indian shipping source familiar with the certification process said most of Sovcomflot's vessels had now migrated to IRClass, via the Dubai arm. Classification societies certify that ships are safe and seaworthy, which is essential for securing insurance and for gaining access to ports. Russia's crude oil sector, hit by strict sanctions due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, has been forced to seek buyers outside the West while turning to Russian transporters and insurers to handle its exports. India, which has refrained from condemning Russia given its longstanding security ties, has sharply boosted Russian crude oil purchases in recent months. Western sanctions against Russia prompted many oil importers to shun trade with Moscow, pushing spot prices for Russian crude to record discounts against other grades. That provided Indian refiners, which rarely used to buy Russian oil due to high freight costs, an opportunity to snap up low-priced crude. Russian grades accounted for about 16.5% of India's overall oil imports in May, compared with about 1% in all of 2021. TOP TIER India's ship certifier is one of 11 members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), top-tier certifiers that account for more than 90% of the world's cargo-carrying tonnage. The Russia Maritime Register of Shipping was also part of the group until March, when its membership was withdrawn following a vote by 75% of IACS' members. Membership in IACS, which sets technical standards, typically makes a certifier more attractive for insurers, ports, flag registries and shipowners seeking safety assurances. The four leading IACS members, from the UK, Norway, France and the United States, have stopped services to Russian companies due to the sanctions. A spokesperson for IRClass, however, when asked about the certification data for Sovcomflot's fleet, responded: ""Indian Register of Shipping, as an international ship classification society, reiterates that we have not classed vessels which are owned, flagged or managed by Russian companies."" The spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter, including on the Dubai unit's connection to its Russian parent. Sovcomflot is subject to sanctions and other restrictions by the UK and the European Union, while Washington has restricted its financial activities. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An IACS spokesman said that IRClass' actions were not a matter for discussion by the association. ""IACS is not involved in the operational and commercial activities of its members, including appraisal, approval surveying and testing of vessels and equipment and the issuing of classification and statutory certificates where authorised,"" he said. ""As such, these developments do not get discussed within the association."" Sovcomflot's chief executive told reporters last week that the group had insured all its cargo ships with Russian insurers and the cover met international rules."
