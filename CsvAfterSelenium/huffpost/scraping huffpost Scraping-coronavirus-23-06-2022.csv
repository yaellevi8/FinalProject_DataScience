0,Broadway Drops Theater Mask Mandate As Stars Fall Sick With COVID,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Broadway theaters in New York will drop coronavirus mask mandates for audience members starting July 1, the industry trade group Broadway League announced Tuesday. “The owners and operators of all 41 Broadway theatres in New York City will keep masking mandates in place at all Broadway theatres through June 30, and will adopt a ‘mask optional’ policy for the month of July,” the announcement stated. “Audience members are still encouraged to wear masks in theaters.” The Broadway League said it will reconsider masking protocols on a monthly basis and will announce the policy for August in mid-July. “This is not an easy decision — there are more people that want masks off than on, but plenty still want them on — and we’re encouraging people that have any concerns to wear their masks,” said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, according to The New York Times. The requirement is being loosened after several Broadway stars tested positive for COVID this month. Beanie Feldstein, the protagonist of “Funny Girl” on Broadway, announced she contracted COVID in an Instagram post on June 7. Feldstein was replaced by Julie Benko during her recovery, according to a tweet posted on the show’s account. Hugh Jackman, the star of “The Music Man,” announced he tested positive for the virus on June 13, less than a day after performing at the Tony Awards. Jackman said Max Clayton would fill in for him. The relaxed mask mandate at Broadway theatres was announced on the same day that New York City downgraded its COVID-19 alert level from high to medium, citing a decrease in cases and hospitalizations. COVID-19 cases per 100,000 in the city were now at 240.4 and hospitalizations per 100,000 had fallen to 9.8, Mayor Eric Adams and Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said in a joint statement. “We’re grateful to New Yorkers for their continued attention and vigilance as we’ve made our way through to the other side of this wave,” the two officials said. The medium COVID alert level includes recommendations for people to get vaccinated and boosted, and to wear a mask in public indoor spaces where the vaccination status of other people is unknown. Under the previous high alert level, New Yorkers were told to wear a mask indoors regardless of vaccination status. Adams and Vasan said health officials learned a lot about the virus during this year’s surge and highlighted the importance of existing public health safety measures, including masks. “Testing, vaccinations, treatments, and masking have been vital tools to keep people alive and out of the hospital,” they said. “But we know there remains no greater defense against this virus than vaccination, which is why we’re pleased that young children are now eligible for the protection they deserve, and can’t wait to begin under-5 vaccination.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended COVID vaccinations for children under age 5 on Saturday. The first vaccinations for this age group in New York City are set to begin Wednesday. Earlier, this month New York’s mayor rolled back mask requirements for children under the age of 5 “in all early childhood settings.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

3,When Will It Be Time For Another Booster? Here's What Experts Think.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost We’ve seen second COVID-19 boosters recommended for older adults and people with underlying health conditions — but what about the general population? Will another booster shot be recommended for everyone in the fall to fend off a winter surge? Or will the next booster campaign be geared to those most at risk for developing severe disease? These are the key questions vaccine experts are considering right now. The Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee recently met to discuss the next round of boosters. The panel agreed that while there is a strong need to craft a plan ahead of fall and winter, there isn’t enough data to know who would benefit from another booster. The committee also didn’t decide whether a next booster would be an already-approved shot or one of the updated vaccines currently being tested. The advisory group will meet again on June 28. Infectious disease experts generally agree that developing a booster strategy is a complicated task. The utility of boosters varies greatly, depending on people’s age and risk factors, so we may very well see the next round of boosters limited to at-risk individuals. Vaccine scientists also have to consider that a booster strategy for everybody might not make sense today, but we could very well find ourselves in a totally different situation come September. “The solution isn’t just throwing vaccines at everybody. It’s actually having a meaningful understanding of what are the goals of the vaccine program and what can we expect the vaccines to do,” Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician and scientist at the University of Toronto, told HuffPost. Bogoch said in order to determine if, when and how boosters will be needed, it’s crucial to first look at the goals. The current shots have waning protection against infection and onward transmission, Bogoch explained, but they continue to be safe and very effective at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalizations and death. Health officials will need to decide if they want boosters to prevent hospitalization and death (which the initial shots still do in most people) or to prevent symptomatic COVID (a harder feat), according to Arjun Venkatesh, a Yale Medicine emergency medicine doctor and associate professor at Yale School of Medicine. The effectiveness of vaccines varies between people. Immunocompromised individuals and older people’s antibody levels wane earlier, which makes these people strong candidates for booster doses, Venkatesh said. “The reason we want to boost older adults first is because in many ways, the vaccine — their first two doses — didn’t work as well as it worked in younger people,” Venkatesh said. That second booster has helped at-risk groups be “as vaccinated” as healthier individuals who got only two doses. It’s reasonable to expect that the next round of boosters will be recommended for vulnerable individuals before the next wave of the pandemic this fall, Bogoch said. Venkatesh also believes we will see booster campaigns targeting at-risk populations more than blanket booster recommendations. It’s not uncommon for booster campaigns to roll out for select groups — we already do this for shingles, pneumonia and flu shots. Trials have shown that a fourth dose of the currently available vaccines doesn’t provide much more protection against mild or asymptomatic infections than a third dose in healthy people under 50, according to Supriya Narasimhan, the division chief of infectious diseases and hospital epidemiologist and medical director of infection prevention at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “The increase in vaccine efficacy was small and short-lived, therefore the benefit of an additional dose is not thought to be great,” Narasimhan said, noting that the benefits of a fourth dose were much more pronounced in people over 60. As of now, it’s unclear if and when the general population should get an additional booster dose. “That’s going to be based, largely, on when we start seeing young, healthy people being at risk for hospitalization or death — because that’s the outcome we’re trying to prevent — or when we see young, healthy people have waning levels of antibodies” that put them at risk, Venkatesh said. That would suggest it’s time for everybody to get another shot. Bogoch suspects booster campaigns will vary from place to place. The United Kingdom recently suggested its fall booster campaign would be limited to older and more vulnerable people. Quebec, on the other hand, already made a booster dose available for anyone over the age of 18 who wants it. Bogoch wouldn’t be surprised if health authorities elsewhere eventually say that anyone who wants a dose can get it. Last week, Moderna announced its omicron-specific booster was well tolerated and demonstrated a more robust antibody response against omicron variants than the original COVID shot. The company hopes to submit preliminary data soon. If authorized, the shots will be available in late summer, with booster options in the fall. Pfizer is also working on a fall booster, though little data has been released on that. The FDA recently recommenced authorization for the Novavax vaccine’s primary series, but the shot is still being studied as a booster. It’s difficult to predict when the new versions of the COVID vaccines will be available, Bogoch said. Even though they’ve been developed and are being tested, that doesn’t mean they will be recommended for everyone. Vaccine scientists and health officials will first need to figure out if the new shots help people regain protection against infection and onward transmission — and, if so, how well, Bogoch said. “It’s completely expected that something like that would still protect against severe protection, hospitalization and death — but can we regain protection against infection and onward transmission and can we do so in a durable manner that doesn’t wane over a couple of months?” Bogoch asked. These questions have not yet been answered. Venkatesh suspects that, like the flu, we will eventually have annual vaccines for COVID. At some point, we may pivot to different types of vaccines — like intranasal vaccines that can help fight transmission and pan-coronavirus vaccines that can target various types of coronaviruses at once. But we won’t see these in 2022, Bogoch noted. For now, experts want to tread carefully when it comes to boosters and prioritize them for the people who need them most while tracking how the current shots hold up in the rest of the population. “It is important that we are timely and cautious in deploying additional boosters for the general population because the increase in protection is likely to be small and short-lived, especially in those who have hybrid immunity due to infection and vaccination,” Narasimhan said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

4,The Most Common Side Effects Of The COVID Vaccine In Kids Under 5 (And How To Alleviate Them),coronavirus," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost COVID vaccines for kids under 5 are finally looking like a reality, after the FDA met this week and recommended authorizing the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations for COVID for kids age 6 months to 5 years. “Our expectation is that within weeks, every parent who wants their child to get vaccinated will be able to get an appointment,” Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, told reporters during a recent press briefing. The Pfizer vaccine for kids age 6 months to 4 years old is given in three doses: Each one is three micrograms, which is one-tenth of the dose for adults. The first two doses are spaced out three weeks apart and the third one is given at least two months after the second. The Moderna vaccine for kids 6 months to 5 years old consists of two doses given four weeks apart. Each one is 25 micrograms, or one-quarter of the adult version. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey from May found that about a fifth (18%) of parents with kids under 5 said they intend to get their child vaccinated “right away” once the FDA authorizes the shots’ use. Meanwhile, another 38% say they would want to “wait and see” how it works for others in the age group before getting their child vaccinated. Earlier this week, we answered some of the most pressing questions parents of kids under 5 may have about the vaccine. Top of mind for many parents and researchers are the side effects that may accompany the vaccine. Side effects, including fever and fatigue, were generally minor in both vaccines and less common than seen in adults, according to FDA reviewers. “The side effects were definitely a discussion point during the FDA meeting yesterday,” said Krupa Playforth, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Virginia, who reviewed the FDA data. “Both vaccines are actually generally well-tolerated, and the side effect spectrum is fairly similar to other age groups,” she said. “The Pfizer vaccine contains a smaller amount of antigen, and this plays out in the side effects that were reported: There were fewer overall side effects for that vaccine.” So what are the known side effects? Below, Playforth and other pediatricians who reviewed the FDA’s data ― and one doctor who was involved in the Pfizer clinical studies for kids under 5 ― explain what to expect and how to alleviate any symptoms your child may experience after getting the vaccines. For 6-to-23-month-year olds, irritability and drowsiness were most common, according to Patricia DeLaMora, a pediatric infectious disease specialist for Boston Children’s Health Physicians. Side effects like irritability and drowsiness are common following most vaccines, though, said Jaime Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Primary Care Medical Group. “Parents may notice their child wanting to sleep more, acting more cranky and clingy, or eating less,” she told HuffPost. “These symptoms will most likely only last a day.” For 2-5 year olds, pain at the injection site was commonly reported, followed by fatigue. But the pain is generally mild and children often don’t complain about it unless asked, according to Janet Englund, a professor of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital and University of Washington who was involved in the Pfizer clinical studies in young children this past year. “For reaction site pain or swelling, it’s often best to cover it with a long-sleeve shirt so they don’t have to see it,” she said. “Give Tylenol if pain is interfering with daily activities but in general, distraction alone works well.” One thing to note: It’s not recommended that you give your child any over-the-counter pain medicine before the shot. It’s fine to give your child some after the vaccine to help with any mild reactions. “After the vaccine, acetaminophen is thought to be safe to control discomfort caused by fever, pain at injection site,” said DeLaMora. If you have any questions, talk to the vaccine provider or your child’s doctor. Most fevers occurred within two days of vaccination and resolved within a day or two, Playforth said. “Both fever and local reactions were more common for Moderna than for Pfizer, but these also resolved quickly,” she said. “One child in the Moderna trial had a febrile seizure ― a convulsion in a child that’s caused by a fever ― after the first dose, but received a second dose without any incident.” Again, many of the side effects that children may experience after COVID vaccines (such as fever and pain at the injection site) can be managed with ibuprofen (Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), which can reduce pain and fever, “Be sure to check with your child’s pediatrician if you do not know the appropriate doses for your child,” said Elizabeth Lloyd, M.D., a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital. “Aspirin is not generally recommended for use in children. But once the fever has resolved, many children will feel less irritable.” Make sure your child stays hydrated, too, Playforth said. Fatigue was another side effect for kids under 5, according to the FDA, though it was much less severe and lasted a shorter time than the fatigue reported by adults, Englund said. “Nearly all cases it lasted less than 24 hours,” the doctor said. “These side effects are similar or even less than those seen with other childhood vaccines. In children, having fatigue means they may take a longer nap or go to bed earlier.” Parents may want to plan accordingly when getting their kids vaccinated by making sure they have free time to rest on the day of and the day following their vaccine, Friedman said. “The big picture here is that even if there are local or systemic side effects, they are largely self-limited and resolve within a few days,” Playforth said. “In terms of helping your child through them, focus on comfort and hydration, as with all illnesses.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

5,Here's What Parents Of Kids Under 5 Need To Know About The COVID Vaccine,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life After considerable delay, kids under the age of 5 — the last group to be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination — will now be able to get their shots. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration’s outside advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for kids under 5 after data found both vaccines to be safe and effective. The FDA officially greenlit the vaccines for the age group on Friday, followed by the CDC on Saturday. With the rollout days away, parents of kids under 5 may have some vaccine-related questions and concerns. Experts address some of the most common ones below. Shots should be available for this age group as early as Tuesday. Parents should call their child’s doctor to discuss when and where they can get the vaccine; some offices may have shots available. Federal pharmacy chains and community health centers are also other options. “Our expectation is that within weeks, every parent who wants their child to get vaccinated will be able to get an appointment,” White House COVID-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told reporters during a recent press briefing. Every state except Florida has preordered the pediatric COVID vaccines in anticipation of the authorization. Those in Florida may have delayed access to the shots, The Daily Beast reported, and parents may have to rely on getting a vaccine from a pharmacy or community center instead of from a doctor or hospital. The Pfizer vaccine for kids ages 6 months to 4 years old consists of three doses: Each one is three micrograms, which is one-tenth of the dose for adults. The first two doses are spaced three weeks apart and the third one is given at least two months after the second. The Moderna vaccine for kids 6 months to 5 years old is made up of two doses given four weeks apart. Each one is 25 micrograms, or one-quarter of the adult version. Both the companies and federal health officials have found that both vaccines produced the required immune response in this age group. According to Pfizer, its three-dose vaccine was 80% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 during the time omicron was the dominant variant. However, this data was from a mid-trial analysis, so the final results may differ. Moderna said its two-dose vaccine was 51% effective against symptomatic infection for children ages 6 months to under 2 years, and 37% effective for children ages 2 to 5. These numbers — which were based on data mostly collected during the omicron wave — are similar to the efficacy of the vaccine for this variant in older populations, the company said. But these numbers don’t tell the whole story. While the shots may not do a great job at preventing infection altogether, “efficacy against severe disease in children is expected to be very, very high for both brands of shots, though neither clinical trial reported enough COVID hospitalizations to properly calculate those stats,” journalist Katherine J. Wu wrote for The Atlantic. Children in this age group tolerated both vaccines well, and their reactions to the shots were generally quite mild. Common side effects included irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, pain at the injection site and headaches. Fevers were mere common with the Moderna shots. However, the rates were similar to those of other recommended pediatric vaccines. (High fevers were rare). CDC data published in December found that for the millions of vaccinated kids ages 5 to 11, side effects have been largely mild and short-lived. Common ones include pain at the injection site, headaches and fatigue. The Pfizer vaccine is currently the only shot authorized for use in kids ages 5 to 17. Moderna requested authorization for its vaccine for kids ages 6 to 17 this week, which was unanimously endorsed by the FDA’s outside advisers on Tuesday. If your child experiences symptoms after the vaccine, Dr. Ruth Kanthula —assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital — recommends contacting your pediatrician. “Parents may consider giving over-the-counter fever- and pain-reducing medications as needed after their child receives the vaccine,” she told HuffPost. However, giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen before the shot to prevent side effects is not recommended, as it could reduce the body’s immune response to the vaccine. It seems that many parents of kids under 5 have at least some hesitation about vaccinating their little ones. According to an April Kaiser Family Foundation survey, only 18% of parents with kids in this age group say they would get their child vaccinated as soon as health officials authorize the shot. Another 38% say they would take a “wait and see” approach; 27% say they will “definitely not” get their kid vaccinated. And 11% said they’d only do it if it was a requirement for school or day care. It’s true that young kids are at low risk for serious illness from COVID-19. But that risk isn’t zero, said Kanthula, who strongly encourages parents to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. “Children of all ages and especially children with other conditions — for example, children who are immunocompromised, are obese or have asthma —are at risk of developing severe disease,” she said. “Additionally, children are at risk of developing a post-COVID illness such as long COVID or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children — or MIS-C.” During the pandemic, more than 30,000 kids under the age of 5 have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and nearly 500 have died, according to Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy. These deaths “may have been preventable from a vaccine,” said Dr. Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Overland Park, Kansas. A CDC study published in April found that hospitalization rates during the omicron surge were almost twice as high for unvaccinated 5-11-year-olds as for vaccinated kids in that age range. Around one-third of those hospitalized had no underlying medical conditions. Not only does the vaccine protect kids from getting seriously ill, but it also reduces the risk for their families and communities. This is especially important for protecting older people, individuals with compromised immune systems and underlying conditions, as well as babies younger than 6 months. “Getting young kids vaccinated will decrease symptomatic illness and spread of the virus to others,” Burgert said. Consider, too, the ways vaccinating this age group will help stave off further disruptions to their lives. “Countless children have, for two and a half years, had to endure a steady drumbeat of school closures, exposures, and the heartache of sick caregivers and friends — many of whom have died,” Wu wrote in her piece for The Atlantic. Many parents and caregivers have expressed frustration about the lag in vaccine authorization for young children. Those feelings are understandable, Kanthula said. But know that the delays shouldn’t be cause for concern. In fact, the additional time it’s taken should only bolster parents’ confidence in the process. “Approval for drugs and vaccines for use in children typically lags [behind] approval for use of the same products in adults,” Kanthula explained. “A lot of work goes into ensuring drugs are safe and effective for children because children are considered a vulnerable population.” “Children are not little adults, and researchers know vaccine doses cannot just be cut in half for children,” Kanthula continued. “Children of different ages have different physiology and physiological responses. The same is true with regards to immune systems of children.” For example, the authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for kids under 5 was delayed because the original two-dose vaccine did not produce the desired immune response. It was safe — just not as effective as expected. That’s why the company decided to begin testing a three-dose series. Burgert said the parents of young kids she sees in her practice have not expressed concerns about the delay. “Families want to have confidence that the vaccine works and it is safe, and they are willing to wait until the data suggests both are true,” she said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

6,There Are Millions Of People Who Can't Just 'Move On' From COVID,coronavirus," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost A little more than two years after COVID-19  first entered our lives, most Americans are eager to get back to normal ― or at least “normal-ish.” As of today, 77.2% of Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 66.1% are fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg News global vaccine tracker. Children as young as 5 are now eligible for vaccines, and most have returned to in-person schooling. (Kids under 5 may have authorized vaccines as soon as next week.) In May, employment rose by 390,000 jobs and the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, to declare “COVID is over,” as many Americans are eager to do, wouldn’t be accurate: Cases of COVID-19 are on the rise yet again ― though thanks to vaccines, the prevalence of testing and the use of antiviral drugs, there hasn’t been an uptick in hospitalizations and deaths as in previous surges. But, most importantly, we can’t forget about the various groups of Americans who can’t get “back to normal” quite yet ― as much as they would love to do so. For the immunocompromised, COVID remains a major threat. For those with long COVID, working through brain fog and other long-haul symptoms is an uphill battle. For the doctors and epidemiologists working with the public, COVID has to remain top of mind: It’s their job to treat those with the virus and encourage the public to keep infections down through masking and other precautions. For those who lost someone to COVID, “getting back to normal” seems impossible when “normal” always included their loved ones. Below, we spoke to a handful of people from each of these groups about what living with the ongoing effects of COVID looks like for them right now, and how they feel about the general rush to “move beyond” COVID. Responses have been edited lightly for clarity and length. More than 1 million people have now died of COVID in the U.S. since the pandemic’s start, according to data released by Johns Hopkins University in May. Pamela Addison lost her husband Martin to COVID in April 2020. At the time, the New Jersey couple’s children were 2 years old and 5 months old. Today, Addison is the founder of Young Widows and Widowers of COVID-19. “When I lost Martin, my life turned upside down: I lost the person who was financially supporting us at the time because I was on an unpaid maternity leave. I lost my best friend, teammate, co-parent, and the person I was supposed to grow old with. I will never move on from COVID, but I will move forward with my life. COVID is always going to be present, because it changed my life and my children’s lives forever. That is something you can’t and that I will never forget. The rush to get back to normal is frustrating. My life will never be normal again, because Martin is no longer here. I think instead of focusing on this push to ‘normal,’ I really think we should focus on how we can help those impacted by COVID. Over 200,000 children have lost a parent/caregiver to COVID, and they are struggling. Why not talk about how we can help and support these young children emotionally and financially? They have become the forgotten grievers of this pandemic, and it is completely frustrating and disheartening to know that people don’t care about my children’s trauma or grief ― trauma and grief that they share with so many others. We cannot keep ignoring these children and not talking about how COVID has affected their lives forever. “My life will never be normal again, because Martin is no longer here. I think instead of focusing on this push to ‘normal,’ I really think we should focus on how we can help those impacted by COVID.” My daughter, although happy, also lives with a small hole in her heart. There are days she is sad because she misses her Papa and is trying to understand why he wasn’t here long enough to do things with her. She remembers her second birthday (her last with him) and talks about how he made a special cake with her, with unicorn sprinkles. She asks, ‘Why don’t I have a daddy here like my friends?’ She looks at his pictures and talks about him with her little brother, the boy who really doesn’t remember him. The boy who at times randomly will start saying, ‘My Papa died,’ with this look of sadness. They will carry their loss with them forever, and grieve throughout their lives.” Kristin Urquiza’s father Mark died from COVID in June 2020. In the wake of his death, Urquiza cofounded Marked By COVID, a national nonprofit that “promotes accountability, recognition, justice, and a pandemic-free future.” “My dad, Mark Urquiza, died from COVID on June 30, 2020. I would love to ‘move on’ from COVID, but to do so we must first recognize that COVID is not over and that ‘back to normal’ is not an option for anyone. The White House and CDC are downplaying the risks and sending us back into danger, with zero effort to mitigate infections. One in five COVID infections results in long COVID, regardless of vaccination status. The only way to safely ‘move past’ this is to recognize past harms and current risk. A majority of people in the U.S. support masking. Recommending or requiring masking and other mitigation measures like improved ventilation would allow us to ‘get back to living’ without killing or disabling ourselves or others in the process, and data shows there is absolutely no reason – scientific, political, economic or otherwise – to ignore our current reality and gaslight the public into taking unnecessary risks with zero consent. Ignoring the existence of a highly transmissible airborne virus and allowing it to spread unchecked is not normal. Normal would be the ability to trust that our leaders have our best interests at heart and are providing honest information, clear science-based guidelines and support through an ongoing pandemic. Normal would be taking simple precautions like masking, eating outdoors and knowing your COVID status before gathering to keep us all safe. Normal would be recognizing 1 million U.S. lives lost to this disaster and creating appropriate space for grief, mourning and remembrance.” Tehseen Ladha is a pediatrician and assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. Ladha has treated patients with COVID and argued against dropping COVID restrictions due to her concerns over pediatric hospitalizations. “I have seen more children with COVID in the past four months than in the whole pandemic combined. I have had pediatric patients who have had serious complications from COVID, and I also have patients that have long COVID. There is so much unknown about this virus and its long-term effects; letting it spread so quickly and widely could have devastating health effects on humanity. We should be concerned about things like long COVID, disability and morbidity. I have also seen children infected with COVID again after having had an infection six weeks prior, so the idea of herd immunity to protect our population is false. I don’t think moving on from COVID is possible for anyone at the moment. My husband and I are both physicians and we have close family members who are elderly, immunocompromised, and a child who is still too young to be vaccinated, so ‘moving on’ is not possible for us. I think people are under the illusion that they are moving on as they return to their daily lives without masks and other important pandemic protections, but the world has changed, and there is constant evidence of that in our communities. “I have seen more children with COVID in the past four months than in the whole pandemic combined.” At our children’s hospitals, there have been families waiting outside of the ER for over an hour waiting to see just the triage nurse. COVID hospitalizations continue to contribute to this health system strain. Schools and day cares also show constant evidence of the ongoing pandemic where there continue to be large absences (staff and students) due to COVID or other illnesses, especially since the lifting of masks in schools. My pediatric patients in day care are constantly sick (no mitigation measures to prevent virus circulation) and need to be kept home in case it’s COVID, leading to many missed work days for their parents and caregivers. Even airlines have been reporting flight delays and cancellations due to staff illness. Clearly, the pandemic continues to impact every facet of society, from health to education to the economy, but our leaders (elected and otherwise) continue to send the message that it is over.” Jason M. Kane is a pediatrician and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children’s Hospital. He’s an attending physician at the hospital’s pediatric intensive care unit and has worked with many young patients with COVID. “As a pediatrician, I read with great ongoing frustration guest op-ed commentaries in prominent media outlets from physicians and other purported public health experts advocating for a ‘return to normal’ and ‘living with the virus.’ Contrary to a popular talking point, children do, in fact, die from COVID, more than any single recent influenza year on record. Even healthy children. More than 1,000 children have died from COVID in the U.S. alone. In spite of resources available, some parents have chosen to ignore expert guidance (CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics) and have intentionally withheld vaccination from their children. Do those unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children have the tools to protect themselves? And equity matters, too. Children in areas of the U.S. with high poverty rates, a high concentration of minorities, and where access to health care is more challenging, are less likely to be vaccinated than those in more affluent areas. These are the patients I see in my hospital. So can they return to ‘normal’? Of course I would like the pandemic to be over, but not at the expense of the health and welfare of children or other people in my communities. “Treating a child victim of an automobile accident who wasn’t in a proper seatbelt or car seat is emotionally taxing. And COVID is no different. Kids should not die … period.” I have faced both personal and professional attacks for wanting to keep my family and my community safe. It comes part and parcel with advocacy work. As a front-line pediatrician in the ICU, it saddens me to watch any child require medical care as a result of preventable harms. Treating a child victim of an automobile accident who wasn’t in a proper seatbelt or car seat is emotionally taxing. Treating a child who was the unintended victim of a gunshot wound is horrific. Watching a child suffer after an accidental drowning is a pain I wish on no one. And watching children struggle to breathe from infections such as influenza or RSV taxes my spirit as a father and as a physician. And in all of those instances, there is an opportunity for public safety and public health advocacy. And COVID is no different. Kids should not die … period. As a pediatrician, my goal is to try to ensure that all children can live to their potential, and I hope to continue to advocate for and to protect kids from COVID with whatever means we have available.” Betsy Basom is a Spanish teacher in Los Angeles who caught COVID at the end of March 2020. She’s had long COVID symptoms ever since. “I have long COVID, or post-acute sequelae from COVID (PASC). There are many different names for it. What it means to me is that I have not returned to my prior state of physical health. I have had so many symptoms that I would not care to list all of them (about 50 different ones at different times). The worst right now is the post exertional malaise or PEM, which causes a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath and extreme exhaustion after relatively little exertion. I was in great health before I got COVID. I had just been to Mammoth at the end of December 2019 and had done some of my most rigorous and best skiing ever. I skied down the backside of the mountain, starting my descent at the highest elevation on the mountain of about 11,000 feet. I can’t even imagine having the energy to do that right now. I have attempted to go for short hikes with low elevation gains, but I always have had to use my inhalers and need a complete day of rest afterward. The PEM is real, and it has changed the way I live my life. Now, I just go home and sit or lay down. I watch a lot more TV now. I don’t have the brain power to avidly read like I used to, so watching movies and shows is easier. My life isn’t the same. My after-school activity level has dramatically decreased. My life is much more limited right now, and I’m learning how to manage it. While so many people declare their relief that the pandemic is over and have returned to their normal, busy lives, I have to say that it isn’t over for me and millions of other people. “I was in great health before I got COVID. I skied down the backside of the mountain. ... I can’t even imagine having the energy to do that right now.” What is life with long COVID like? Over the past two years, I have visited many specialists (cardiologist, pulmonologist and hematologist, to name a few) and received treatments for asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, pleurisy and pericarditis, along with quite a few other scares along the way. Two months into my illness, one of my blood test results showed a ‘thrombotic event likely,’ so I had to go get an urgent CT scan. No major blood clots were evident in my lungs, so that was good news. I still have to take asthma medication daily, though, and my lungs just haven’t felt the same. My bloodwork showed some abnormal results, but then when a follow-up occurs, they disappear, only to come back again. A diagnosis for a condition has been elusive. So many people say ‘COVID is just like the cold or the flu. It’s OK if you get it now. We’re vaccinated. We are safe. You have to keep on living.’ They don’t understand the experiences of others who have had it much worse. I will do whatever I can to avoid getting COVID again, and I will do what I can to protect those around me.” Maya David García is an artist in Chicago who has been living with long COVID for two years. “I contracted COVID in March 2020 at my former job. I was very sick for six weeks with acute symptoms. To date, I still haven’t fully recovered, and I now have moderate asthma, worsened heart palpitations and POTS symptoms, and worsened fatigue and chronic fatigue symptoms. I was living with disabilities and several chronic illnesses before I got COVID. Now, I am no longer able to work and am permanently disabled due to fatigue, post-exertional malaise, mobility issues, dizziness and daily, chronic pain. In addition, I’m now also immunocompromised because I’m permanently having to take medicines to treat asthma that weaken my immune system. So for me, when I see news anchors and even public health officials talking about us being ‘post COVID,’ I want to scream because I know that community spread of COVID is still high with mask and vaccine mandates being repealed in all public spaces, including public transit. “When I see news anchors and even public health officials talking about us being ‘post COVID,’ I want to scream.” As a person who also doesn’t have a car, it’s infuriating that I must risk my life and safety every time I leave home, whether it’s to run an errand, pick up my prescriptions or go to a doctor’s appointment. I’ve had a Lyft driver scream at me for advocating for myself and asking her to wear a mask while I was in the car. I’ve been called all kinds of slurs — racist, ableist, misogynistic and transphobic ― because I’m advocating for disabled people as a multiracial Indigenous two-spirit nonbinary person. All because I’ve advocated for the return of indoor mask mandates, especially on public transit. I want people to understand that the danger of COVID is still very much there, and for people like me, there is no ‘getting back to normal.’ That I’m immunocompromised because I got COVID in 2020, and my immune system issues are now lifelong. That anyone can develop long COVID or other complications from COVID. No one is fully immune, even if you’re vaccinated and boosted.” Saskia Popescu is an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at George Mason University. Throughout the pandemic, Popescu has worked to prepare for and mitigate the spread of the disease. “As an infectious disease epidemiologist and infection preventionist, I have been COVID-focused since 2020. I’ve worked insane hours at my job, but have also done work in science communication on social media and volunteering for some agencies that needed COVID guidance. I’ve also experienced the vitriol from people against scientists. It’s frankly hard and weird to spend your entire life working and training for something like this (and trying to prevent it), and then to live it and have wave after wave of preventable situations occur ― it’s hard. People don’t realize the toll it’s taken on the infectious disease response folks. I don’t think we will move on ― the lessons are critical for us to learn, both within the infectious disease world but also among the public. “It’s frankly hard and weird to spend your entire life working and training for something like this (and trying to prevent it), and then to live it and have wave after wave of preventable situations occur.” I’m ready to move past the vitriol and the Groundhog’s Day habit we have with COVID (deciding it’s over, relaxing restrictions and interventions, and then surging cases), but I think it’s so important we take the lessons from COVID and apply them moving forward: everything from investing in public health and emerging infectious disease preparedness to increased attention on those most impacted by a pandemic, encouraging people to stay home when sick or if they have a loved one at home sick, normalizing masks and washing your hands. I think there is a middle ground where we maintain a sustainable approach to COVID that is risk-matched but requires some ongoing attention and investment, and I’m worried people no longer see it that way. We don’t have to live in a pandemic state forever, but we need to invest in public health; the ongoing need for vaccines and accessibility to testing, masks and paid time off. We need to understand that we live in a world where infectious diseases do pose a threat and that ignoring them will not make them go away.” Katrine Wallace is an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s School of Public Health. In the course of the pandemic, her TikTok page, where she debunks myths about COVID and the vaccine, blew up to 269,000 followers. “While continuing to teach classes and conduct research for my day job, I started making evidence-based TikToks in the spring of 2020, and my entire life pretty much pivoted toward COVID-19 and being of service. I have built a community that trusts me and relies on me for evidence-based information, misinformation debunking and advice, and I take that responsibility seriously. It’s like having a very busy second job that I don’t get paid for. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was on social media for the same reason everybody else was; I was bored during the shutdown and I needed some entertainment. Scrolling, I’d see posts of people’s kids, food and pets, but also a lot of COVID-19 misinformation. Motivated by a sense of duty as an epidemiologist and public health professor, I started to make my own social media content to debunk the nonsense and teach evidence-based information. I get a lot of communications from people who are currently very scared of mitigations dropping: immunocompromised people, people who are older, people with elderly relatives, people with unvaccinated children and people with rare diseases with little research or information as to what COVID and long COVID would do to them. Of course I would love to move on. I love going to concerts and traveling, and I dream of doing those things in the same carefree manner that I once did. But as a public health scientist, I feel I can’t really move on from COVID-19 with a community health mindset until the risks for all members of the community are no longer present. “The idea that people who are at risk should just ‘stay home’ while others refuse to mitigate and allow COVID-19 to rip through communities is not acceptable.” I continue to wear a mask to protect vulnerable people in public, I do rapid antigen tests before I see my friends and family, and I avoid indoor large gatherings (because I do have regular contact with more vulnerable people). The idea that people who are at risk should just ‘stay home’ while others refuse to mitigate and allow COVID-19 to rip through communities is not acceptable. Public health measures are meant to take care of all members of the community because we are all interconnected. I will be more comfortable short term with the general situation when everyone is eligible to be vaccinated (kids under 5), and in the longer term, when we see endemic patterns of this virus (e.g. influenza has a very defined seasonal pattern — we know when to vaccinate for it, we know when to expect it). Nothing like that exists yet for COVID-19. It is unpredictable for the most part, and we still see peaks in incidence based on new, more transmissible variants of the virus, instead of seasons or patterns of endemicity.” Meghan McCoy, a stay-at-home mom who is now unemployed due to COVID and ongoing health problems. “I am immunocompromised. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME, aka chronic fatigue syndrome), a post-viral illness I developed after mono. Fall of 2021 is when my hope slowly crumbled. The delta variant was on the horizon. No vaccine yet for our kid. Our district would only offer in-person schooling. We felt as long as they were masked, we could risk it. But then I saw the gaping holes in our district’s plan: They could take off their masks indoors as long as they were three feet apart, and there were no added mitigations around higher-risk activities like lunch or singing. I pushed the district to monitor ventilation and to add filtration like Corsi Rosenthal boxes, but they were unwilling to listen. They were more concerned with appeasing the anti-maskers than with protecting high-risk families in our community. I quit my job; it wasn’t worth the risk, and we decided to homeschool our child. In November of 2021, they finally approved the vaccine for kids ages 5-11. We jumped at the chance and vaccinated our child right away. We planned to send them back to in-person school after winter break. It was more risk than we wanted to take, but at least our kid was vaccinated. Then they decided to repeal masks altogether in our school district. They would return to ‘normal’ as if it was 2019. It was clear the district did not care about high-risk members of our community. I cringed every time a friend posted on Facebook about how much they ‘loved our school’s community.’ They had created a community of exclusion, and they couldn’t even see it. “Sitting for two hours in an auditorium with 700 unmasked people to watch a student play seems like a stupid way to die. And that’s the question I have to ask myself every time: ‘Is this an event worth risking my permanent health or life over?’” In the spring of 2022, we found a private school. Their mitigation measures weren’t perfect, but it was better than what the public school could offer. In the rush to get back to normal, they have left us behind. We go out less. There is no way I can ‘personal responsibility’ myself out of an event that seats 700, like a school play. We could’ve worn high-filtration masks ourselves, but I had no idea how many in the audience would wear masks, what the ventilation is like, or if they’ve added filtration units beyond the central HVAC. Sitting for two hours in an auditorium with 700 unmasked people to watch a student play seems like a stupid way to die. And that’s the question I have to ask myself every time: ‘Is this an event worth risking my permanent health or life over?’ As much as I might get frustrated, depressed or bitter about having to create this isolation island, I always remind myself that at least I had that privilege. We were able to make choices to protect ourselves that others couldn’t. There are high-risk individuals in our society who can’t isolate, and many died. Many more are still out there hoping their job won’t make them sicker or land them in the ICU. We shouldn’t have to rely on hope. We should be able to rely on our community. I have to hope one day our community will wake up. I only hope it’s before we disable tens of millions with long COVID or create a new, more lethal variant. It doesn’t have to be this way. We have the tools to make our world safer and healthier, but we’re too lazy to use them. As many have said, this pandemic is the worst group project ever.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"
7,FDA Panel Backs COVID-19 Vaccine For Kids Under 5,coronavirus," COVID-19 shots for U.S. infants, toddlers and preschoolers moved a step closer Wednesday. The Food and Drug Administration’s outside vaccine advisers gave a thumbs-up to Moderna’s two shots for the littlest kids. The panel is set to vote later Wednesday on whether to also recommend Pfizer’s three-shot series for those youngsters. The outside experts voted unanimously that the benefits of Moderna’s shots outweigh any risks for children under 5 — that’s roughly 18 million youngsters. They are the last remaining group in the U.S. to get vaccinated and many parents have been anxious to protect their little children. If all the regulatory steps are cleared, shots should be available next week. “This is a long-awaited vaccine,” said one panel member, Dr. Jay Portnoy of Children’s Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. “There are so many parents who are absolutely desperate to get this vaccine and I think we owe it to them to give them a choice to have the vaccine if they want to.” Dr. Peter Marks, FDA’s vaccine chief, opened the meeting with data showing a “quite troubling surge’’ in young children’s hospitalizations during the omicron wave, and noted 442 children under 4 have died during the pandemic. That’s far fewer than adult deaths, but should not be dismissed in considering the need for vaccinating the youngest kids, he said. “Each child that’s lost essentially fractures a family,’’ Marks said. FDA reviewers said both brands appear to be safe and effective for children as young as 6 months old in analyses posted ahead of the all-day meeting. Side effects, including fever and fatigue, were generally minor in both, and less common than seen in adults. The two vaccines use the same technology but there are differences. In a call with reporters earlier this week, vaccine experts noted that the shots haven’t been tested against each other, so there’s no way to tell parents if one is superior. “That is a really important point,”′ said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. “You can’t compare the vaccines directly.’’ If the FDA agrees with its advisers and authorizes the shots, there’s one more step. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide on a formal recommendation after its own advisers meet Saturday. If the CDC signs off, shots could be available as soon as Monday or Tuesday at doctor’s offices, hospitals and pharmacies.. Pfizer’s vaccine is for children 6 months through 4 years; Moderna’s vaccine is for 6 months through 5 years. Moderna’s shots are one-quarter the dose of the company’s adult shots. Two doses appeared strong enough to prevent severe illness but only about 40% to 50% effective at preventing milder infections. Moderna has added a booster to its study and expects to eventually offer one. Pfizer’s shots are just one-tenth its adult dose. Pfizer and partner BioNTech found that two shots didn’t provide enough protection in testing, so a third was added during the omicron wave. Pfizer’s submitted data found no safety concerns and suggested that three shots were 80% effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus infections. But that was based on just 10 COVID-19 cases; the calculation could change as more cases occur in the company’s ongoing studies. The same FDA panel on Tuesday backed Moderna’s half-sized shots for ages 6 to 11 and full-sized doses for teens. If authorized by the FDA, it would be the second option for those age groups. Currently Pfizer vaccine is their only choice. The nation’s vaccination campaign started in December 2020 with the rollout of adult vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, with health care workers and nursing home residents first in line. Teens and school-age children were added last year. Moderna said in April that it is also seeking regulatory approval outside the U.S. for its little kid shots. According to the World Health Organization, 12 other countries already vaccinate kids under 5, with other brands. In the U.S., it remains uncertain how many parents want their youngest vaccinated. While COVID-19 is generally less dangerous for young children than older kids and adults, there have been serious cases and some deaths. Many parents trying to keep unvaccinated tots safe have put off family trips or enrolling children in daycare or preschool. Still, by some estimates, three-quarters of all children have already been infected. Only about 29% of children aged 5 to 11 have been vaccinated since Pfizer’s shots opened to them last November, a rate far lower than public health authorities consider ideal. Dr. Nimmi Rajagopal, a family medicine physician at Cook County Health in Chicago, said she’s been preparing parents for months. “We have some that are hesitant, and some that are just raring to go,’’ she said. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

8,FDA Advisers Back Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine For Older Kids,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — A government advisory panel Tuesday endorsed a second brand of COVID-19 vaccine for school-age children and teens. The Food and Drug Administration’s outside experts voted unanimously that Moderna’s vaccine is safe and effective enough to give kids ages 6 to 17. If the FDA agrees, it would become the second option for those children, joining Pfizer’s vaccine. The same FDA expert panel will meet Wednesday to consider tot-sized shots from Moderna and Pfizer for the littlest kids, those under 5. Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine has long been available for adults in the U.S. and elsewhere and more than three dozen countries offer it to older children, too. If the FDA authorizes Moderna’s vaccine for teens and younger children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will next decide whether to formally recommend the shots. The Massachusetts company is seeking clearance for two doses, and plans to later offer a booster. Tuesday’s vote was only for two doses — full-strength for 12-17 and half-sized doses for those 6-11. “The data do support that the benefits outweigh the risks for both of these doses, in both of these age groups,” said the CDC’s Dr. Melinda Wharton, a member of the panel. “I believe that this will provide families an important option” and may be particularly important for families who live in areas where coronavirus spread is increasing, said another panel member, Dr. Ofer Levy of Boston Children’s Hospital. The FDA held up Moderna’s teen vaccine for months while it investigated a rare side effect, heart inflammation. That’s mostly a risk for teen boys and young men, and also can occur with the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna got extra scrutiny because its shots are a far higher dose. In their review, FDA scientists said there were no confirmed cases of the heart inflammation in Moderna’s kid studies. But experts say the studies may have had too few participants for a rare side effect like that to appear. “That clearly needs to be watched closely going forward as we expand the use of the vaccine,” said Dr. Mark Sawyer, a panel member from the University of California, San Diego’s medical school. As for other side effects, FDA officials said nothing worrisome was reported — mainly sore arms, headache and fatigue. The FDA analysis concluded that two doses of Moderna are effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness in teens and younger kids, with the levels of virus-fighting antibodies comparable to those developed in young adults. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 93% for the teens, and 77% for the younger children, according to the FDA analysis. However, the research was done when earlier versions of the coronavirus were causing most U.S. infections, before more contagious versions emerged. It’s also based on a limited number of COVID-19 cases, making the estimates a bit rough. A booster shot was added to the studies, and data is expected in about the next month, Moderna officials said. Booster shots are now recommended for children vaccinated with Pfizer’s shots, as well as for all adults. One panel member, Dr. Paul Offit, noted that vaccine effectiveness has declined against newer variants of the coronavirus. Offit, of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he supported Moderna’s proposals only because he expects a third dose will be offered, which he says is needed before someone should be considered fully vaccinated. How much demand there will be for even two Moderna shots isn’t clear. Teens became eligible a year ago for Pfizer’s vaccine, which uses the same technology, and only 60% have gotten two doses. Shots for younger kids started in November; about 29% have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. If the FDA authorizes Moderna shots for teens and schoolchildren, a CDC spokesperson said the agency is not expected to review the vaccine until later this month. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

9,Hugh Jackman Diagnosed With COVID-19 Just Hours After Tony Awards Performance,coronavirus,"  Hugh Jackman, the star of Broadway’s “The Music Man,” tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday, according to the show’s producer Kate Horton. The positive test result comes less than a day after Jackman performed with his cast during Sunday’s Tony Awards, Deadline reported. It’s unclear whether other members of the cast who joined Jackman on-stage tested positive as well. A post shared by @thehughjackman HuffPost reached out to “The Music Man” for further comment. This is the second time Jackman has battled COVID-19, per Entertainment Weekly. He had to bow out of performances for the musical to recuperate from his first bout with coronavirus in December 2021. Jackman’s understudy Max Clayton will fill in as Professor Harold Hill on the show from June 14 through June 21. “We’re excited to see [Clayton] perform alongside the wonderful Sutton Foster and we wish Hugh a speedy recovery,” Horton wrote.

0,"Ivermectin Does Not Have Meaningful Impact On Treating COVID, U.S. Study Finds",coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug popularized as a way to treat COVID-19 at home despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration, was not shown to have a meaningful effect in shortening symptoms or decreasing the rate of hospitalizations or deaths, according to clinical trial results published Sunday. The study, led by scientists from Duke University and Vanderbilt University, included 1,591 participants who received either 400 mcg/kg of the ivermectin, which is often used to treat livestock, or a placebo. Forty-seven percent of the participants said they had received at least two doses of a COVID vaccine. This clinical trial has not yet been peer-reviewed. The main measure of effectiveness of ivermectin used in the study was based on time to sustained recovery, which was defined as three consecutive days with no COVID symptoms. The key secondary outcome included a composite of hospitalization or death by day 28, wrote Duke Clinical Research Institute’s Susanna Naggie, MD, MHS, one of the researchers involved in the study, in the document reviewing the study’s results. Taking ivermectin for three days “resulted in less than one day of shortening of symptoms and did not lower incidence of hospitalization or death among outpatients with COVID-19 in the United States during the delta and omicron variant time periods,” the document stated. This clinical trial was part of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-6 study group, which investigates whether certain drugs approved by the FDA could be effective in treating patients at or over 30 years old with early mild-to-moderate COVID. “ACTIV-6 adds to the growing evidence that there is not a clinically relevant treatment effect of ivermectin at this dose and duration,” Naggie wrote. “While those with severe symptoms at baseline appeared to have beneficial treatment effect with ivermectin as compared with placebo, this subgroup was small, thus these findings should be considered exploratory.” The conclusion of this study is consistent with findings of another large clinical trial in Brazil, which was published by the New England Journal of Medicine in May. “Treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of COVID-19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of COVID-19,” those researchers concluded. Despite the lack of proof that the drug has a substantial effect against COVID, ivermectin has had prominent boosters, including podcaster Joe Rogan. Rogan shared a story on Twitter in February inaccurately claiming the drug was effective against the omicron variant in a phase III clinical trial. Rogan deleted the tweet after this turned out to be incorrect. Last year, Rogan said he took the drug after he tested positive for COVID in September 2021 as a treatment. A month earlier, the FDA had tweeted warning people against taking self-treating with ivermectin, which is commonly used on animals. “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it,” the agency tweeted in August 2021. The FDA had also published a detailed post on their website explaining why Americans should stay away from the drug. In Arkansas, inmates filed a lawsuit against a doctor who unknowingly prescribed the drug to them as a COVID treatment. A northwest county in the state though subsequently issued a resolution praising the physician in February. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Many Baby Formula Plants Weren't Inspected Because Of COVID,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators have historically inspected baby formula plants at least once a year, but they did not inspect any of the three biggest manufacturers in 2020, according to federal records reviewed by The Associated Press. When they finally did get inside an Abbott Nutrition formula plant in Michigan after a two-year gap, they found standing water and lax sanitation procedures. But inspectors offered only voluntary suggestions for fixing the problems, and issued no formal warning. Inspectors would return five months later after four infants who consumed powdered formula from the plant suffered bacterial infections. They found bacterial contamination inside the factory, leading to a four-month shutdown and turning a festering supply shortage into a full-blown crisis that sent parents scrambling to find formula and forced the U.S. to airlift products from overseas. The gap in baby formula plant inspections, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, is getting new scrutiny from Congress and government watchdogs investigating the series of missteps that led to the crisis. A recent bill would require the Food and Drug Administration to inspect infant formula facilities every six months. And the government’s inspector general for health has launched an inquiry into the FDA’s handling of Abbott’s facility, the largest in the U.S. Abbott resumed production at the plant early this month under a legally binding agreement with the FDA, but the shutdown and nationwide shortage exposed how concentrated the industry has become in the U.S., with a handful of companies accounting for roughly 90% of the market. As COVID-19 swept across the U.S. in early 2020, the FDA pulled most of its safety inspectors from the field, skipping thousands of routine plant inspections. The FDA did conduct more than 800 “mission critical” inspections during the first year of the pandemic, the agency said in a statement. Regulators selected facilities for inspections based on whether they carried a specific safety risk or were needed to produce an important medical therapy. Only three of the nation’s 23 facilities that make, package or distribute formula made the cut. The FDA resumed routine inspections in July 2021. The inspection records reviewed by the AP show gaps as large as 2 1/2 years between FDA’s 2019 inspections and when regulators returned to plants owned by the three leading formula manufacturers: Abbott, Reckitt and Gerber. In fact, the FDA still has yet to return to one key plant owned by Reckitt and two owned by Gerber, according to agency records. All those facilities are operating around the clock to boost U.S. formula production. “The FDA would have had more chances to catch these issues if they’d been inspecting during the pandemic,” said Sarah Sorscher, a food safety specialist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She acknowledged the difficult trade-off the FDA faced in pulling its inspectors to reduce their exposure to COVID-19. “Certainly there was a price to pay for protecting their workers during that time.” Baby formula manufacturers were “consistently identified as a high priority during the pandemic,” and there is currently no backlog of inspections, the agency told the AP in response to inquiries about the gaps. The agency said it skipped about 15,000 U.S. inspections due to COVID, but it has already made up about 5,000 of those, exceeding its own goals. Under current law, the FDA is only required to inspect formula facilities every three to five years, but the agency has consistently inspected facilities annually — until the pandemic. “Our top priority now is addressing the urgent need for infant formula in the U.S. market, and our teams are working night and day to help make that happen,” FDA stated. But outside experts say the gap in inspections speaks to a blind spot in the government’s response effort, which was successful at preventing shortages of drugs and other medical supplies. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf says regulators knew shutting down Abbott’s plant would create supply problems, but there was little evidence of urgency between when inspectors shuttered the plant in February and recent emergency measures to allow more imports from abroad. Longtime food safety specialists see a deeper problem at the highest levels of the FDA, where physicians and medical scientists for decades have prioritized oversight of drugs and medical products over food. “It’s very challenging for them to get engaged at all in this area because they don’t have the background, the knowledge and the experience in it,” said Steven Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, which represents state-level inspectors. The FDA shares oversight of food production and safety with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. FDA inspections of food facilities peaked in 2011 and have declined most years since, despite increased funds and powers by Congress. The FDA said that while U.S. inspections have declined, foreign facility inspections have increased. There’s no certainty that extra inspections during COVID-19 would have prevented the contamination problems at the Sturgis, Michigan, plant that was shut down. And Abbott says that its products have not been directly linked to the infections, two of which were fatal. But the plant did have earlier problems, including a 2010 formula recall due to possible contamination with insect parts. “I think facilities that had known problems that could cause a food safety risk should have been part of FDA’s mission critical work,” Mandernach said. “And this facility would have been among those.” Not having regular inspections — or even the threat of them — can lead to changes in culture at plants like Abbott’s, Mandernach noted. “If you’re driving down the highway and you know the state troopers have been furloughed, might you go a little faster than if you knew there was a trooper on duty?” Mandernach asked. ___ Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

2,FDA: Pfizer COVID-19 Shot Appears Effective For Kids Under 5,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials said Sunday that kid-sized doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe and effective for kids under 5, a key step toward a long-awaited decision to begin vaccinating the youngest American children. The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis of the Pfizer shot ahead of a Wednesday meeting where outside experts will vote on whether the shots are ready for the nation’s 18 million babies, toddlers and preschoolers. Kids under 5 are the only group not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S. Late last week the FDA posted a similar analysis of Moderna’s shots for children under 6. If regulators clear the shots by one or both companies, vaccinations could begin as soon as next week with the drugmakers ready to rapidly ship doses ordered by the government. Parents have been pressing federal officials for months for the opportunity to protect their smallest children as more adults shed masks and abandon other public health precautions. While only about 3% of U.S. COVID cases are in the age group 6 months to 4 years, hospitalization and death rates in that group are higher than those for older children, according to the FDA’s analysis — one reason experts have said protecting this group is important. The FDA said children who received Pfizer’s shots during testing developed high levels of virus-fighting antibodies expected to protect them against coronavirus. That’s the basic threshold needed to win FDA authorization. But additional testing turned up key differences, with stronger results for Pfizer. Pfizer’s vaccine, given as a three-shot series, appeared 80% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, although that calculation was based on just 10 cases diagnosed among study participants. The figure could change as Pfizer’s study continues. Moderna’s two-dose series was only about 40% to 50% effective at preventing milder infections, though the two companies’ shots were tested at different times during the pandemic, when different variants were circulating. Moderna has begun testing a booster for tots. On Wednesday, the FDA will ask an independent panel of vaccine experts to debate both companies’ data before voting. The FDA is not required to follow the group’s recommendations, but the process is seen as a key step in publicly vetting the shots. The FDA is expected to make its official decision shortly after Wednesday’s all-day meeting. The next step: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends how to use vaccines, will convene its own expert panel to debate which tots need vaccinations. It’s not clear how much demand there will initially be for the shots. A recent survey suggests only 1 in 5 parents of young children would get their kids vaccinated right away. Vaccines have been available since November for older U.S. schoolchildren, yet less than a third of those ages 5 to 11 have gotten the two recommended doses, according to government figures. For the youngest children, each company is offering different dose sizes and number of shots, beginning at 6 months through 4 years for Pfizer and through 5 years for Moderna. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech plan to offer two shots three weeks apart followed by a third at least two months later — each one-tenth the dose given to adults. Pfizer is currently the only company with a COVID-19 vaccine for older U.S. children. Moderna is seeking FDA clearance for two shots, each a quarter of its adult dose, given about four weeks apart. The FDA currently allows Moderna’s vaccine to be used only in adults. But some countries allow full-size doses for teens and half-size shots for kids ages 6 to 11 — a step the FDA also is considering. More than 30,000 U.S. children younger than 5 have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and nearly 500 coronavirus deaths have been reported in that age group, according to U.S. health officials. The government allowed pharmacies and states to start placing orders for tot-sized doses last week, with 5 million initially available — half made by Pfizer and half by Moderna. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

4,U.S. Lifts COVID-19 Test Requirement For International Travel,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is lifting its requirement that international air travelers to the U.S. take a COVID-19 test within a day before boarding their flights, easing one of the last remaining government mandates meant to contain the spread of the coronavirus. A senior administration official said the mandate expires Sunday at 12:01 a.m. EDT, saying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that it’s no longer necessary. The official, speaking Friday on the condition of anonymity to preview the formal announcement, said that the agency would reevaluate the need for the testing requirement every 90 days and that it could be reinstated if a troubling new variant emerges. The Biden administration put in place the testing requirement last year, as it moved away from restrictions that banned nonessential travel from several dozen countries — most of Europe, China, Brazil, South Africa, India and Iran — and instead focuses on classifying individuals by the risk they pose to others. It came in conjunction with a requirement that foreign, non-immigrant adults traveling to the United States need to be fully vaccinated, with only limited exceptions. The initial mandate allowed those who were fully vaccinated to show proof of a negative test within three days of travel, while unvaccinated people had to present a test taken within one day of travel. In November, as the highly transmissible omicron variant swept the world, the Biden administration toughened the requirement and required all travelers, regardless of vaccination status, to test within a day of travel to the U.S. Airline and tourism groups have been pressing the administration for months to eliminate the testing requirement, saying it is discouraging people from booking international trips. Many other countries have lifted their testing requirements for fully vaccinated and boosted travelers in a bit to increase tourism. In February, the groups argued the testing requirement was obsolete because of the high number of omicron cases already in every state, higher vaccinations rates and new treatments for the virus. “I’m glad CDC suspended the burdensome coronavirus testing requirement for international travelers, and I’ll continue to do all I can to support the strong recovery of our hospitality industry,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., said in a statement. The lifting of the requirement comes six weeks after a federal judge ended the CDC’s mask requirement for mass transit, including trains, planes, buses and transit hubs, saying the agency exceeded its authority. The Biden administration is appealing that ruling, saying it aims to protect the CDC’s ability to respond to future health emergencies. The official said the CDC will continue to recommend COVID-19 testing prior to air travel of any kind as a safety precaution."
5,"The Most Common Questions About The Novavax COVID Vaccine, Answered",coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Thanks to COVID-19 vaccines, we’ve been able to see loved ones more often with less fear and experience less intense symptoms. However, the pandemic is far from over, with cases continuing to spike in large waves, people dealing with long COVID and more. As scientists and health experts continue to learn how to fight the virus, more treatment and prevention methods are becoming available ― including additional vaccines. This week, a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine. Should it get the green light from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the shot could be cleared for emergency authorization use in the coming days. So why is a new shot being authorized when there are millions of unused COVID vaccines expiring on shelves? Will this new vaccine move the needle in the pandemic? Here’s what experts think about it and everything else you need to know: Unlike the Pfizer, Moderna and J&J vaccines — the first two which are mRNA-based, and the latter of which is viral vector-based — Novavax’s is protein-based. Novavax’s COVID-19 shot “is a technology commonly used in most other vaccines, such as flu, hepatitis B and shingles,” said Dr. Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious diseases physician at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “The protein, which is selected in this case for the Novavax vaccine, is the spike protein found in COVID-19.” When your body recognizes the protein, it prepares to fight it. “The person’s immune system does the rest by recognizing the foreign (i.e., nonhuman) protein and producing antibodies to block it,” explained Dr. David Diemert, the clinical director of George Washington University’s Vaccine Research Unit. The Novavax vaccine also has an adjuvant, or additive, that helps increase the immune response to the protein, according to Diemert. He called it more of a “traditional” vaccine since some older vaccines are also protein-based. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is a two-shot regimen given 21 days apart. As far as boosters go, Sobhanie said he’s not sure if one will be needed to fight against future variants or not, given the limited data. Diemert believes a booster may be needed. “Based on the decrease in antibody levels over time after the two injections of the Novavax vaccine, and the appearance of new variants, it is possible that booster doses will be needed to maintain immunity,” he said. According to 2021 data, prior to the omicron variant becoming the dominant strain, Pfizer was about 95% effective in protecting people from symptomatic COVID-19 after they first get the shots; Moderna was 94.1% effective and J&J was 66% effective. (As we now know, the vaccines have been less effective against omicron at preventing symptomatic disease, and the antibodies gained from the shots do wane over time. A booster increases our protection. All the vaccines drastically reduce the risk of severe disease and death.) When tested last year, Novavax was 90.4% effective in protecting people against symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% effective in protecting people against moderate to severe COVID-19 after people got the shots. So, the number is slightly lower for mild COVID-19 cases — but not one to be ignored, especially with the benefits we’ll discuss in a bit. “Novavax has been used in other parts of the world and has emergency use authorization from both the European Union and World Health Organization,” Sobhanie added. But can it protect us against new variants, like omicron, and its subvariants like BA.2 and BA.4? Experts are still gathering information there. “Those trials were mostly done before the appearance of the delta and omicron variants, so the efficacy against those isn’t known,” Diemert explained. The side effects — which are relatively mild, according to Sobhanie — mostly include injection site pain, fatigue, headaches and muscle pain. “The FDA released data that there were five cases of myocarditis, which occurred in patients who received the Novavax vaccine during the clinical trials, four of which occurred within 20 days of vaccination,” he said. However, the biggest risk of myocarditis comes from getting COVID-19 itself. (Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle, which can impact the heart’s ability to pump blood.) Both experts said there aren’t any risks other than these potential side effects. “None of these were severe or resulted in any permanent harm,” Diemert added. Most experts don’t see a problem. “The technology used to manufacture this vaccine is nothing new, and has been used in other vaccines which people have received,” Sobhanie said. “I believe it provides an additional choice for people … who may be hesitant to receive the mRNA-based vaccine or the Johnson & Johnson. … The side effect profile is similar to the mRNA-based ones.” Diemert also said he “fully support[s]” the panel’s recommendation to authorize the vaccine. “From the clinical trials conducted to date, the vaccine has been shown to be safe, well-tolerated and as effective as the currently approved/authorized vaccines against the earlier versions/variants of the virus.” He named three benefits of the Novavax vaccine: It was made through a more “traditional,” tried-and-true route (so people may be less hesitant to take it), it doesn’t have to be frozen like other vaccines, and it’s yet another tool for preventing more or stronger COVID-19 cases. These are all crucial, especially since global distribution of vaccines is low. Novavax, with its easier storage method, may help to fill that gap. It’s hard to give a specific date; the FDA and the CDC still need to officially sign off before the vaccine can be administered. It could be as early as next week. There’s no info out yet about whether the Novavax vaccine is safe for young children, but Diemert said studies show similar results for safety, immune response and efficacy in people ages 12 to 18 years old as it does for adults. Ultimately, more vaccines are a good thing ― as long as people are continuously urged to take them. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations. On Assignment For HuffPost"
6,Virus Testing Becomes The New Normal As China Sticks To 'Zero-COVID',coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Thousands of coronavirus testing sites have popped up on sidewalks across Beijing and other Chinese cities in the latest development in the country’s “zero-COVID” strategy. Lines form every day, rain or shine, even where the spread of the virus has largely stopped. Some people need to go to work. Others want to shop. All are effectively compelled to get tested by a requirement to show a negative test result to enter office buildings, malls and other public places. Liu Lele, who works for a live-streaming company, has no problem getting tested regularly but said the daytime operating hours don’t always fit his schedule. “Sometimes I get held up at work,” he said after finishing a test Thursday near Beijing’s historic Bell and Drum towers. “I wish there were sites open 24 hours or not closing until 7 or 8 p.m.” Regular testing of residents is becoming the new normal in many parts of China as the ruling Communist Party sticks steadfastly to a “zero-COVID” approach that is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world. Major cities have been told to set up testing stations within a 15-minute walk for all residents. Beijing and Shanghai alone have put up 10,000 or more each. Some are made up of folding tables and chairs under a temporary canopy. Others are enclosed square booths from which gloved workers reach out through openings to take a quick throat swab from the next person in line. Many cities including Beijing are requiring a negative test result within the last three days to enter a public place or take the bus or subway. Some have made it a week or 10 days. The tests are free, with the result reflected on the person’s smartphone health app roughly 12 hours later. “This is something we should do,” said Beijing retiree Wang Shiyuan, who gets tested every three days in case he needs to go to the supermarket or take a bus. “Only when everyone obeys the requirements can we reduce the risk of transmission.” The move follows a recent outbreak in Shanghai that spread so widely that authorities locked down the entire city for two months to end it, trapping millions of people and dealing a blow to the national economy. China kept the virus largely at bay for a year and a half by locking down buildings and neighborhoods and quarantining infected people, but the rapidly spreading omicron variant proved more difficult to stop. More than 580 people died in Shanghai — a large number in a country that had reported only a handful of deaths after an initial deadly outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020. Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission, said testing has become more important because omicron is both more contagious and is spread by people without symptoms. “We must adhere to the strategy of expanding prevention centered on nucleic acid testing, so as to control the epidemic earlier and faster,” she said Thursday at a news conference. A handful of new cases — some linked to a nightlife quarter in Beijing and a hair salon in Shanghai — prompted authorities to lock down areas in both cities Thursday. The cases followed an easing of restrictions on movement and the reopening of many retail businesses in the past week. Andy Chen, a senior analyst with the Trivium China consultancy, said the proliferation of testing sites is a reaction to the failure of existing measures to control omicron in Shanghai, though officials have not explicitly said so. Authorities have decided that early detection is needed to control omicron outbreaks without extreme measures that cause major economic disruption. “The regular testing requirements are meant to improve the zero-COVID strategy,” Chen said in an email. “The end goal is to keep the virus under control while avoiding another Shanghai-like lockdown.” Many other countries, their populations weary of pandemic restrictions and eager to move on, are betting that rising vaccination rates and the development of treatments for COVID-19 mean they can avoid lockdowns and other disruptive steps and live with the virus instead. China’s leaders have repeatedly signaled that they believe the “zero-COVID” approach remains the right one for China, even as they try to boost a flagging economy with business tax refunds, easier credit and spending on infrastructure projects. Entry to the country remains restricted, with visas difficult to get and few international flights, making it costly and hard to get a seat. Anyone who does enter must quarantine in a hotel, usually for two weeks. Chinese generally can’t leave the country unless it is for work or study. Most analysts expect the zero-COVID policies to remain in place at least until after a major Communist Party congress this fall at which leader Xi Jinping is expected to get a third five-year term. The party touted its approach as a success when COVID-19 was ravaging other countries, and it doesn’t want a major outbreak in the run-up to its meeting. ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing and researcher Si Chen in Shanghai contributed to this report."
7,The U.S. Is Shifting Money To COVID Vaccines As Congress Stalls And Subvariants Spread,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration is preparing to shift COVID-19 money away from critical public health programs, including testing, to pay for new vaccines and therapeutics, as Congress stalls on approving additional pandemic funding and omicron subvariants spread across the country. A White House official told The Washington Post the administration is taking away $10 billion in total from existing pandemic funding, half of which will go to finance updated vaccines — when those become available — and the other half will pay for treatments, including the Pfizer drug Paxlovid. This funding shift will undercut other initiatives, including plans to produce more COVID-19 tests in the U.S., and a plan to stockpile ventilators and personal protective equipment, another aide told the Post. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, has repeatedly issued warnings to Congress that the U.S. is in need of COVID-19 funding to be prepared for future waves. “If you want to ask what keeps me awake at night, it is that we are going to run out of vaccines,” Jha told reporters in the White House briefing room Friday. “We’re not going to be able to have enough of the next generation of vaccines. We’re going to run out of treatments. And we’re going to run out of diagnostic tests, probably in the late fall into winter, if we end up having a significant surge of infections.” The money scramble comes as two omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5 are spreading fast around the country. BA.4 made up 5.4% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. the week ending June 4, while BA.5 accounted for 7.6% of cases during the same period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both subvariants were first detected in South Africa, where they drove an increase in cases in April and May, according to The New York Times. Still, deaths did not increase as dramatically, and that COVID-19 wave was smaller than previous ones there, Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, told the Times. Shaman expects to see cases rise due to BA.4 and BA.5, but without necessarily seeing a rise in hospitalizations and deaths, if the U.S. follows a similar trajectory to South Africa. For now, BA.2.12.1 still remains the dominant variant, making up over 62% of total cases in the U.S., according to CDC data. Overall, the constant emergence of new subvariants that are able to evade immune responses has meant many Americans have been getting reinfected with COVID-19. Jennifer McDonnell, who lives in Illinois, told ABC News she got the coronavirus in January and thought she could go back to normal life, especially since she had also been fully vaccinated and boosted, only to discover she had been reinfected with COVID-19 within a month, after her doctor ran a test. “When he told me that I was positive for COVID-19 again, I thought, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me,’” McDonnell said. “I thought you know six months, I’m good. I don’t need to wear a mask. We were at like a whole bunch of sporting events … at parties without masks, no social distancing — nothing — we thought we had time.” McDonnell is hardly alone in experiencing reinfection. More than 1.6 million Americans across 24 states have reported getting reinfected with the virus since states started tracking this data, according to ABC. Jha told “CBS Mornings” on Wednesday that the U.S. is not at the stage where it can deal with COVID-19 in the same way it does with the flu, noting the high number of infections, which have been averaging over 100,000 per day this past week. “We are taking a very active, aggressive approach to keeping hospitalizations down,” Jha said. “If we let up on vaccinations, if we let up on treatments, those hospitalizations are going to start climbing back up again.” “We’re in a battle, we’re fighting hard and keeping things at bay. It’s not time to let up and say, ‘OK, this is as good as it gets,’” Jha continued. Dr. @ashishkjha shares why officials are still taking a ""very active, aggressive” approach toward fighting COVID-19 — and gives advice to @GayleKing, who tested positive earlier this week. pic.twitter.com/mp3WNyk2HW Moderna said Wednesday a new vaccine it is developing, combining the original shot with protection against the omicron variant, is effective. The company said its preliminary study results showed those who took the updated shot experienced an eightfold increase in antibodies targeting omicron, according to The Associated Press. The White House announced Thursday vaccinations for children under age 5 could start as early as June 21. Once the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC grant final approval, the Biden administration will make 10 million doses available for pre-order to states, pharmacies and community health centers, with more to follow.

8,White House Lays Out Plan To Get COVID-19 Vaccines To Kids Under 5,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost As parents across the country have long awaited a vaccine against the coronavirus for young children, doses for kids younger than 5 could be available as soon as June 21, according to the Biden administration. A year and a half after vaccines were made available to older U.S. adults in January 2021, senior administration officials laid out a plan to get vaccines to toddlers and babies on a press call Wednesday. By the middle of next week, the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee is expected to meet to decide whether to authorize the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for children under 5. Then, later in the week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would decide whether to recommend the vaccines. Pending FDA and CDC authorization, the Biden administration would immediately begin shipping doses across the country, with 10 million vaccine doses available for states, community health centers and pharmacies to pre-order, and millions more available in the following weeks. Parents will be able to get their kids vaccinated at pediatricians’ and other doctors’ offices, community health centers, children’s hospitals, local pharmacies and other community organizations. The administration also plans to work with libraries and children’s museums, as well as Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander and Native community groups to raise awareness and answer questions about the vaccine. They’ll be reaching out to parents through federal programs including WIC, SNAP, Medicaid and Head Start. Currently, vaccines are available only for children 5 and older and for adults. About two-thirds of Americans have been fully vaccinated so far. If vaccines are authorized for children under 5, nearly everyone in the U.S. would be eligible for the protection against the virus. Pfizer said late last month that three doses of its vaccine offer strong protection for toddlers and babies ages 6 months to 4 years old, and the company was providing its data to U.S. regulators. Moderna was also hoping to get approval to provide two doses of its vaccine for little kids sometime this summer. While coronavirus cases are currently far lower than they were during the major winter spike, COVID-19 cases have still risen significantly in recent weeks, with cases more than tripling over the last two months across the country. More than 300 people on average are dying of COVID-19 complications each day. Last month, the U.S. surpassed a horrific milestone of 1 million people dead from COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

0,Moderna Says Updated COVID Shot Boosts Omicron Protection,coronavirus," Moderna’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine that combines its original shot with protection against the omicron variant appears to work, the company announced Wednesday. COVID-19 vaccine makers are studying updated boosters that might be offered in the fall to better protect people against future coronavirus surges. Moderna’s preliminary study results show people given the combination shot experienced an eight-fold increase in virus-fighting antibodies capable of targeting the omicron mutant, the company announced. Today’s COVID-19 vaccines all are based on the original version of the coronavirus. They’re still providing strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death even after the appearance of the super-contagious omicron variant ― especially if people have had a booster dose. But the virus continues to mutate rapidly in ways that let it evade some of the vaccines’ protections and cause milder infections. So U.S. regulators, and the World Health Organization, are considering whether to order a change in the vaccine recipe for a new round of booster shots in the fall ― when cold weather and kids returning to school are expected to drive yet another surge. Key questions: How to make that change without losing the continued strong protection against COVID-19’s worst outcomes? And what’s the right variant to target? After the huge winter omicron surge, that mutant’s genetically distinct siblings now are the main threats, including one that’s fueling the current U.S. wave of infections. The Food and Drug Administration has set a meeting in late June for its scientific advisers to debate those questions and evaluate data from vaccine makers’ tests of potential new formulas. Pfizer also is studying a combination shot, what scientists call a bivalent vaccine. Moderna said its new study found that a month after the combo shot, recipients harbored higher omicron-fighting antibody levels ― and cross-protection against other prior variants — than the original vaccine triggers. However, antibodies naturally wane so it’s not clear how long the protection against infection will last. The study was performed in 437 people, and safety was similar to today’s boosters, Moderna said. The results were announced in a press release and haven’t undergone scientific review."
1,"Vietnam Health Minister, Hanoi Mayor Arrested In Covid Test Price-Gouging Probe",coronavirus," HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam’s health minister and the mayor of the capital Hanoi have been arrested as part of an expanding investigation into massive price gouging of COVID-19 tests, state media reported. Nguyen Thanh Long was dismissed from his ministry post and Chu Ngoc Anh, who previously was the science minister, was fired as Hanoi mayor, Tuoi Tre online news outlet reported Tuesday. They are being investigated for abuse of power, according to the Ministry of Public Security, and have been expelled from the ruling Communist Party. An investigation concluded earlier that mismanagement in the science and health ministries had allowed Viet A Technology Corporation to inflate prices for test kits supplied to hospitals and health centers in Vietnam. Nearly 60 suspects including ministry officials, public health leaders and military generals have been detained or are being investigated for involvement in the price gouging, according to the Ministry of Public Security. The report said the two officials’ violations had harmed Vietnam’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and were costly to the state budget. A deputy science minister, Pham Cong Tac, also was arrested Tuesday and accused of violating regulations on managing state assets. Viet A took in $172 million for supplying its test kits in 62 localities. Its general director was arrested in December and allegedly admitted his Ho Chi Minh City-based company had inflated the selling price of a test kit to about $20, or 45% more than the original, to earn a difference of $21.5 million. Phan Quoc Viet allegedly confessed to investigators that he paid illegal kickbacks worth $34 million to his state-owned partners who bought his test kits at the inflated prices."
2,Over 82 Million U.S. COVID Vaccine Doses Have Been Discarded As Pandemic Funding Stalls,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost More than 82 million COVID vaccine doses went to waste in the U.S. from December 2020 until the middle of May, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NBC News reported. The majority of discarded doses came from CVS and Walmart, making up about a quarter of wasted vaccines, mainly due to the large amount they handled. Five other vaccine providers — Health Mart, DaVita, Rite Aid, Publix and Costco — threw out a higher proportion of the doses that they received. States also reported on wasted doses. Among them were Oklahoma, which threw out 28% of the doses it received, and Alaska, which discarded 27% of its share. As demand for COVID vaccines decreases, it is inevitable there will be waste, the CDC explained. “As the rate of vaccine administration slows, the likelihood of leaving unused doses in a vial may increase, even when providers continue to follow best practices to use every dose possible,” the CDC states on its website. Some waste is attributed to doses reaching their expiration date before they could be administered to patients, while others were ruined due to power outages that took freezers out of use. Unused doses from opened vials that had to be discarded at the end of the day also accounted for some of the waste, according to NBC News. The U.S. has distributed over 751 million COVID vaccine doses, and administered over 589 million doses. Almost 104 million Americans had received three COVID shots as of Sunday, according to the CDC. This past week, COVID vaccines were administered at an average rate of 63,456 doses per day, Bloomberg reported. The news about wasted doses comes as the Biden administration warns the country is short on funds to pay for vaccines, treatments and tests. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said Thursday he is growing increasingly worried the country will be out of vaccines by the fall if Congress doesn’t approve COVID funding. “If you want to ask what keeps me awake at night, it is that we are going to run out of vaccines,” Jha told reporters. “We’re not going to be able to have enough of the next generation of vaccines. We’re going to run out of treatments. And we’re going to run out of diagnostic tests, probably in the late fall into winter, if we end up having a significant surge of infections.” “We don’t have the resources to buy those things. And those purchases need to be made now,” Jha continued. “They cannot be made in the fall.” The White House said children under five years old could be able to get their first vaccine as early as June 21.

3,"Is COVID-19 Rebound Dangerous? Here's What To Expect, According To Doctors.",coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost As if there aren’t enough mysteries surrounding the coronavirus, the latest headlines have been about something called “COVID-19 rebound.” Some people experiencing this phenomenon are seeing a rebound in COVID-19 symptoms after taking Paxlovid, the five-day oral antiviral medication that stops the coronavirus from replicating in the body. Rebound symptoms are typically mild or on par with the original symptoms, and mostly include a sore throat, runny nose, headache and fatigue. Though scientists don’t yet understand why some people experience a resurgence in symptoms, they suspect that the lingering virus is able to start replicating again after people stop taking Paxlovid. So far, none of the rebound symptoms have led to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Infectious disease doctors say it’s worth knowing that rebounds can happen — as they could prolong one’s isolation — but really aren’t a reason not to prescribe the drug, as it continues to do a great job of keeping people out of the hospital. “If I were to be prescribed Paxlovid, I would take it immediately, knowing that even if I were to have some rebound symptoms after completing the therapy, I know that at this point nobody has been admitted to the hospital because of rebound symptoms,” Anthony Baffoe-Bonnie, associate professor of infectious disease at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and medical director of Carilion Clinic Infection Prevention and Control, told HuffPost. Paxlovid is a five-day course of oral antiviral medications that blocks SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in the body and consequently helps prevent severe disease. In a clinical trial, the drug was shown to be 89% effective at preventing hospitalization and death. The trial also found that about 1%-2% of people taking the drug experience a rebound in symptoms about two to eight days after finishing the full course — though a recent surge in news coverage about COVID-19 rebound has caused an increase in concern. Not everyone who takes Paxlovid will go on to experience a resurgence in symptoms. “Lots of people have taken Paxlovid and haven’t experienced rebound symptoms,” Baffoe-Bonnie said. It’s unknown what causes some people to relapse, but the working theory is that at first, Paxlovid stops the machinery in the body that allows the virus to replicate, which leads to an improvement in symptoms. But, in some people, there may be some viral particles that continue to hang out in the body after the five-day antiviral course, explained Khalilah Gates, associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC recommends people experiencing rebound symptoms prolong their isolation for another five days, then mask up for an additional five days.” “When you stop the Paxlovid, and that machinery starts working again, it starts to replicate that lingering virus, and so you get symptoms again,” Gates said. If you had COVID-19 and recovered after taking Paxlovid, but then started to feel sick again a couple days after you finished the medication, Gates said you’re probably experiencing the rebound. So far, the rebound symptoms are similar to and often milder than the original symptoms. They also tend to resolve in about three to five days. A pre-print case study evaluated the resurgence of symptoms in eight non-immunocompromised people who had taken Paxlovid and found the relapse symptoms were mostly cold symptoms (like a sore throat) along with headache and fatigue. There is no clear trend as to who might be more prone to experiencing a rebound. According to Gates, we don’t have enough case reports to identify who is at risk for a rebound, and at this point, the epidemiology of the rebounds appears to be completely random. “You can see it in individuals who are vaccinated, individuals who are not, individuals who are young, individuals who are old,” Baffoe-Bonnie said. The only trend that seems to be persistent, he added, is that “none of the individuals who have had rebound to date have gotten sick and gone into the hospital to be hospitalized.” Baffoe-Bonnie said that even with rebounds, Paxlovid is still an excellent drug. It’s highly effective at preventing people from getting severely sick and ending up in intensive care. “Those benefits are still seen with Paxlovid, whether you have rebound symptoms or not,” he said. Patients who are at high risk for severe disease if they catch COVID-19 should still be prescribed Paxlovid, Baffoe-Bonnie said. This includes people who are immunocompromised along with people with cancer, older adults, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma or COPD. Gates has been educating all of her patients on the benefits and risks associated with Paxlovid. If she sees a healthy patient with COVID-19 who has no underlying health conditions, she lets them know Paxlovid is out there, but that they probably don’t need it. If a patient comes in with one or more risk factors, she still recommends Paxlovid but wants them to understand the risks — Paxlovid is known to interact with other medications, and a rebound in symptoms could mean they’d have to extend their isolation. Gates prescribes Paxlovid on a case-by-case basis, and wouldn’t discourage anyone from using it simply due to the rebounds. “It’s important to factor it in, but it’s not a reason not to take it,” Gates said. Because the rebound symptoms are similar to or milder than the first set of symptoms, infectious disease doctors are not recommending that people prolong their course of Paxlovid or start an alternative treatment like monoclonal antibodies. The symptoms tend to resolve naturally in three to five days and can be alleviated through over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen, nasal sprays, cough syrups and decongestants. It’s unclear if people experiencing rebound symptoms are contagious, or how contagious they may be. However, out of an abundance of caution, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people experiencing rebound symptoms prolong their isolation for another five days, then mask up for an additional five days. “The safest thing is to consider those rebound cases infectious,” Gates said.

We need more information to understand why rebound symptoms occur, but the medication continues to be highly effective at reducing the severity of COVID-19. “I don’t want the rebound’s mild illness to get in the way of the fact that this medication is one of the few medications that we have to treat COVID as an outpatient — [it’s] particularly beneficial for our patient population that is not vaccinated,” Gates said.

4,"WHO Official: COVID Outbreak In North Korea Is Likely 'Getting Worse, Not Better'",coronavirus," LONDON (AP) — A top official at the World Health Organization said the U.N. health agency assumes the coronavirus outbreak in North Korea is “getting worse, not better,” despite the secretive country’s recent claims that COVID-19 is slowing there. At a briefing on Wednesday, WHO’s emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan appealed to North Korean authorities for more information about the COVID-19 outbreak there, saying “we have real issues in getting access to the raw data and to the actual situation on the ground.” He said WHO has not received any privileged information about the epidemic — unlike in typical outbreaks when countries may share more sensitive data with the organization so it can evaluate the public health risks for the global community. “It is very, very difficult to provide a proper analysis to the world when we don’t have access to the necessary data,” he said. WHO has previously voiced concerns about the impact of COVID-19 in North Korea’s population, which is believed to be largely unvaccinated and whose fragile health systems could struggle to deal with a surge of cases prompted by the super-infectious omicron and its subvariants. Ryan said WHO had offered technical assistance and supplies to North Korean officials multiple times, including offering COVID-19 vaccines on at least three separate occasions. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other top officials discussed revising stringent anti-epidemic restrictions, state media reported, as they maintained a widely disputed claim that the country’s first COVID-19 outbreak is slowing. The discussion at the North’s Politburo meeting on Sunday suggested it would soon relax a set of draconian curbs imposed after it announced the outbreak in early May out of concern about its food and economic situations. North Korea’s claims to have controlled COVID-19 without widespread vaccination, lockdowns or drugs have been met with widespread disbelief, particularly its insistence that only dozens have died among many millions infected — a far lower death rate than seen anywhere else in the world. The North Korean government has said there are about 3.7 million people with fever or suspected COVID-19. But it disclosed few details about the severity of illness or how many people have recovered, frustrating public health experts’ attempt to understand the extent of the outbreak. “We really would appeal for for a more open approach so we can come to the assistance of the people of (North Korea), because right now we are not in a position to make an adequate risk assessment of the situation on the ground,” Ryan said. He said WHO was working with neighboring countries like China and South Korea to ascertain more about what might be happening in North Korea, saying that the epidemic there could potentially have global implications. WHO’s criticism of North Korea’s failure to provide more information about its COVID-19 outbreak stands in contrast to the U.N. health agency’s failure to publicly fault China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. In early 2020, WHO’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus repeatedly praised China publicly for its speedy response to the emergence of the coronavirus, even as WHO scientists privately grumbled about China’s delayed information-sharing and stalled sharing the genetic sequence of COVID-19."
5,Gridlock Could Delay COVID Funds Until Fall — Or Longer,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is headed for “a lot of unnecessary loss of life,” the Biden administration says, if Congress fails to provide billions more dollars to brace for the pandemic’s next wave. Yet the quest for that money is in limbo, the latest victim of election-year gridlock that’s stalled or killed a host of Democratic priorities. President Joe Biden’s appeal for funds for vaccines, testing and treatments has hit opposition from Republicans, who’ve fused the fight with the precarious politics of immigration. Congress is in recess, and the next steps are uncertain, despite admonitions from White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha of damaging consequences from “every day we wait.” Administration officials say they’re running low on money to stock up on, or even begin to order, the latest vaccines, tests and treatments. Also lacking are funds to reimburse doctors treating uninsured patients and to help poor countries control the pandemic. House and Senate Democrats have been wrangling over how to resolve the stalemate and even over which chamber should vote first. It’s an open question whether they’ll ever get the GOP votes they’ll need to pull the legislation through the 50-50 Senate, and prospects in the narrowly divided House are unclear as well. “There is still an urgency to pass a COVID relief package,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week. “It’s very, very much needed.” Optimists hope the measure could start rolling once Congress returns next week. Pessimists say without quick resolution, Democrats may not have enough leverage to push the money to passage until early fall. That’s when they could stuff it into legislation that will probably be needed to finance government — a bill that would avert a federal shutdown, a pre-election distraction Republicans will be desperate to avoid. The heap of sidelined Democratic initiatives has grown this year, a victim of GOP opposition and rebellions by centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Casualties include bills on voting rights, health care, environment, taxes, gun curbs, abortion rights, policing tactics and an investigation of the 2021 Capitol storming by then-President Donald Trump’s supporters. While lawmakers have approved massive packages financing federal agencies through September and helping Ukraine counter Russia’s invasion, other priorities are dead or drifting, even as Democrats’ days running Congress are likely dwindling. Republicans are favored to win House control in November’s elections and could grab the Senate as well, and Democrats’ frustration is clear. “So far it hasn’t moved,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said of Biden’s latest $22.5 billion request for COVID-19, which he initially sent Congress three months ago. “But then neither has sensible gun legislation, neither has voting rights.” “The 50-50 Senate sucks,” she said. The COVID money is needed quickly, officials say. Their warnings have come with over 1 million U.S. deaths from the disease and a fresh variant that daily is hospitalizing over 100,000 Americans and killing more than 300. Both numbers are rising. Officials say that lacking fresh funds, the U.S. is falling behind other countries that are already lining up for supplies needed for fall and winter. That’s prompted Jha to plan for the chance that Congress provides no new money at all, threatening painful choices about what to do if there aren’t enough vaccines or therapeutics for all who need them. “It would be terrible,” Jha told reporters recently. “I think we would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life if that were to happen.” Congress has provided $370 billion for purchasing supplies, for research and other public health initiatives to combat the pandemic, according to administration tallies obtained by The Associated Press. Around $14 billion of it was unspent or not committed to contracts as of April 5, the documents show, serious money but an amount the administration says falls below the ultimate need. Most Republicans are skeptical about added pandemic funding. “I have a hard time believing that there’s not enough money and not enough flexibility already” to use it, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. Counterintuitively but unsurprisingly for the always perplexing Senate, one intractable puzzle stymying Democrats is immigration. Senate Republicans are demanding a vote an amending the pandemic legislation with language retaining Trump-era curbs that, citing COVID-19, have made it easier to bar migrants from entering the U.S. A federal judge has blocked Biden from ending those restrictions. Liberals want Congress to eliminate the clampdown, but moderate Democrats in both chambers facing tough reelections want to vote to retain it. The result: Testy divisions between the Democrats’ two ideological factions, and knotty questions for party leaders about how to resolve them and push a pandemic package to passage. Their task is compounded by disputes between House and Senate Democrats over why the COVID-19 battle remains unresolved. Senate Democrats note a bipartisan $15.6 billion pandemic compromise was on the cusp of House passage in March until that chamber’s progressive Democrats rebelled against spending cuts to pay for it, derailing the money. “We’re waiting for the House to send us something,” Schumer said last week. House Democrats say even if they do, the biggest hurdle will still be the Senate, where 10 GOP votes will be required to reach that chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold for passage. They note that an April deal between Schumer and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for $10 billion in COVID-19 money collapsed after Republicans demanded the immigration vote. “We want to get COVID-19 done, but the only impediment right now is the United States Senate,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters recently. That’s left Republicans waiting for Democrats’ next move. “I would imagine at this point way over half of our members will vote against this, no matter what. So the question is what do you do to get it acceptable to 10 or 12” Republican senators, said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership. “And I don’t know.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Shanghai Moves To End 2-Month COVID-19 Lockdown,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Shanghai authorities say they will take some major steps Wednesday toward reopening China’s largest city after a two-month COVID-19 lockdown that has throttled the national economy and largely bottled up millions of people in their homes. Full bus and subway service will be restored as will basic rail connections with the rest of China, Vice Mayor Zong Ming said Tuesday at a daily news conference on the city’s outbreak. “The epidemic has been effectively controlled,” she said, adding that the city will start the process of fully restoring work and life on Wednesday. Schools will partially reopen on a voluntary basis for students and shopping malls, supermarkets, convenience stores and drug stores will continue to reopen gradually with no more than 75% of their total capacity. Cinemas and gyms will remain closed. Officials, who set June 1 as the target date for reopening earlier in May, appear ready to accelerate what has been a gradual easing in recent days. A few malls and markets have reopened, and some residents have been given passes allowing them out for a few hours at a time. In online chat groups, some expressed excitement about the prospect of being able to move about freely in the city for the first time since the end of March, while others remained cautious given the slow pace and stop-and-go nature of opening up so far. Workers were taking down some of the barriers that had been erected along sidewalks during the lockdown. A few people walked or biked on the still mostly empty streets. One man was getting his hair cut on the sidewalk, as a worker or volunteer in full protective clothing looked on. More than half a million people in the city of 25 million won’t be allowed out Wednesday — 190,000 who are still in lockdown areas and another 450,000 who are in control zones because of recent cases. Shanghai recorded 29 new cases on Monday, continuing a steady decline from more than 20,000 a day in April. Li Qiang, the top official from China’s ruling Communist Party in Shanghai, at a meeting Monday was quoted as saying that the city had made major achievements in fighting the outbreak through continuous struggle. The success came at a price. Authorities imposed a suffocating citywide lockdown under China’s “zero-COVID” strategy that aims to snuff out any outbreak with mass testing and isolation at centralized facilities of anyone who is infected. However, the latest economic data showed that Chinese manufacturing activity started to rebound in May as the government rolled back some containment measures. Schools will reopen for the final two years of high school and the third year of middle school, but students can decide whether to attend in person. Other grades and kindergarten remain closed. Outdoor tourist sites will start reopening Wednesday, with indoor sites set to follow in late June, the Shanghai tourism authority said. Group tours from other provinces will be allowed again when the city has eliminated all high- and medium-risk pandemic zones. Beijing, the nation’s capital, further eased restrictions Tuesday in some districts. The city imposed limited lockdowns, but nothing near a citywide level, in a much smaller outbreak that appears to be on the wane. Beijing recorded 18 new cases on Monday."

8,The Biggest COVID Issues People Bring Up In Therapy,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Even if it feels like we are in “post-pandemic” times, we’re certainly not. Not only are case rates still high, we’re seeing mental health implications. Therapists are just starting to unpack the last two years with their clients. Experts are working harder than ever trying to accommodate patients with spiking mental health concerns as a result of the ripple effects of COVID-19. In addition to grief, depression, anxiety and more, here are some of the themes they’re commonly seeing in their sessions: If you and your significant other have spent every day working, living and quarantining together for the better part of two years, you might have seen issues come to light that weren’t there pre-pandemic. Josh Jonas, a psychotherapist in New York City at The Village Institute, said this is a common concern among people now. “Relationships are very much suffering now that we’ve kind of gotten into this new normal of being around each other all the time ... working from home. So now we get to the real difficult parts of relationships,” he explained. A regular theme he’s seeing is some partners needing freedom and others not understanding why they’re not feeling connected. The split of household labor, differing risk tolerances and other issues have also come up. Contradicting data shows that researchers aren’t sure yet if the pandemic is causing divorce rates to soar or fall, but it’s a trend we will know more about with time. The education gap for children in and out of classrooms, navigating virtual learning, and being left without their usual educational supports is apparent in therapy. “With the kids, some of the biggest things we’re seeing is general increased anxiety, depression, a lot of worry about school, and a lot of kids really got off track during COVID and do not feel like they’ve been able to recover,” said Dr. Lateefah Watford, an Atlanta-based child psychiatrist through Kaiser Permanente. This is a particular challenge for students and their families who have always been “high achievers,” who haven’t really struggled academically before, she added. And it’s not just academics — students who have missed major social milestones are grieving those losses, and feeling like the transition “back to normal” is abrupt. Lara Goodrich, a psychologist in Madison, Connecticut, said that teenagers especially missed major milestones in high school, then were thrust into the college scene unprepared. “Pretty much all of them have reflected on what it was like to have this loss of their later years of high school ... many of them feel like they’re behind in their emotional and social maturity as college students,” she said. People often reminisce or talk about that fateful day in March 2020 when everything shut down. The shift out of normal life ― without notice and indefinitely ― is still being discussed in therapists’ offices. Goodrich said that unmasking is causing a similar feeling, triggering people who were very comfortable masking to again sense that anything can change in an instant. “It was like a sudden shift where it felt like things change on a dime,” she said. “And then they found themselves needing to make some really tough decisions about how they operated in the world [after mask mandates lifted].” This sense of uncertainty causes people to make decisions out of fear, a trend she is seeing. “I try to help somebody separate their thoughts and emotions apart from things that are being driven by fear — [those] aren’t decisions that necessarily hold water long-term for us, as they tend to be reactive or impulsive,” she said, adding that while pandemic-based fears are valid, people are struggling to shift to other decision-making processes now. The last two years have led to a career reckoning. For 9.5 million people, regaining jobs lost during the early pandemic months wasn’t immediate, nor was it easy. Others grappled with burnout. Many struggled to make ends meet. One group who experienced much of this is health care workers. Watford said many of her health care clients are starting to cut their hours where possible due to sheer exhaustion. Watford added that there can also be feelings that come up returning to an office that is far from “business as usual.” The risk of COVID when returning to work and interacting with others can be a source of anxiety. For those who never left in-person work, these fears have been prevalent for quite some time and will continue to be. Finally, Watford noted that governmental support during the pandemic was, for some, “better than what they would get breaking their back at jobs that pay minimum wage.” When that disappeared, it caused many people to have to balance their family’s basic health and food security needs with the “reality of working 80-90 hours per week.” This continues to be a source of stress and there’s a real need for reform. “We have to recognize that I think there are jobs, but I don’t know that the jobs are the same anymore,” Watford explained. If you are experiencing mental health concerns, each of our contributing experts emphasized the importance of reaching out to a mental health professional. If that’s an obstacle, try speaking with your general physician as soon as possible; they may be able to connect you with mental health help. (Here are a few other affordable options as well.) “Even if you don’t think you exactly fit into the box of depression, don’t keep suffering,” Goodrich said. There’s power in addressing the strife we’ve all endured over the last few years. On Assignment For HuffPost"

0,"With Covid Rates Climbing, White House Aims To Make Antiviral Treatment More Accessible",coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House on Thursday announced more steps to make the antiviral treatment Paxlovid more accessible across the U.S. as it projects COVID-19 infections will continue to spread over the summer travel season. The nation’s first federally backed test-to-treat site is opening Thursday in Rhode Island, providing patients with immediate access to the drug once they test positive. More federally supported sites are set to open in the coming weeks in Massachusetts and New York City, both hit by a marked rise in infections. Next week, the U.S. will send authorized federal prescribers to several Minnesota-run testing sites, turning them into test-to-treat locations. Federal regulators have also sent clearer guidance to physicians to help them determine how to manage Paxlovid’s interactions with other drugs, with an eye toward helping prescribers find ways to get the life-saving medication to more patients. Despite a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases, deaths from the virus have remained largely stable over the past eight weeks, as vaccine booster shots and widely accessible treatments have helped to delink infections and mortality. Confirmed infections in the U.S. have quadrupled since late March, from about 25,000 a day to more than 105,000 daily now. But deaths, which have tended to lag infections by three to four weeks over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, have declined steadily and are now plateaued at fewer than 300 per day. It’s the first time in the course of the pandemic that the two have not trended together, said White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. He called it an important development in helping Americans get back to normal life. “What has been remarkable in the latest increase in infections we’re seeing is how steady serious illness and particularly deaths are eight weeks into this,” he said. “COVID is no longer the killer that it was even a year ago.” Jha said that given the wider use of at-home rapid tests, whose results often go unreported to public health officials, the true number of daily infections is likely 200,000 or more — double the reported rate — which he said only makes the death rate plateau more significant. He credited vaccines but also a more than four-fold increase in prescriptions over the last six weeks for the highly effective treatment Paxlovid. Jha said about 25,000 to 30,000 courses of Paxlovid are being prescribed each day. When administered within five days of symptoms appearing, the drug has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Due to a change in the way Paxlovid is allocated to states, the number of pharmacies where it is available has doubled in the last month to almost 40,000. “We are now at a point where I believe fundamentally most COVID deaths are preventable, that the deaths that are happening out there are mostly unnecessary, and there are a lot of tools we have now to make sure people do not die of this disease,” Jha told The Associated Press on Wednesday. As the summer months approach, Jha said the “number one” thing people need to do is to “go and get boosted” — and if they have a breakthrough infection, they should consult with their doctor about getting Paxlovid. He said gatherings of all sizes can take place more safely because of the tools available — if people make use of them. “In places in the country where boosting rates are much lower, where the infection is starting to spread more, I am absolutely concerned that we’re going to see, unfortunately, we may see more serious illness,” he said. “Being vaccinated and boosted is a huge part of making sure that those kinds of activities are substantially safer,” he added. “And then, of course, we want to make Paxlovid as widely available across the entire country, so that if you do end up getting a breakthrough infection, you’re still protected against serious illness.” The U.S. has ordered 20 million courses of Paxlovid from the drugmaker Pfizer, and the country risks running out this winter if the drug continues to be used widely. The White House has been pressing Congress for additional funds for months to support purchasing more Paxlovid and other treatments, as well as additional boosters. While the administration has started planning for the potential need to ration the federal supply of vaccines if Congress doesn’t act, Jha said right now his message to prescribers is that they shouldn’t worry about the supply. “I believe that we should be using as much as it’s necessary to protect Americans now,” Jha said."

2,Tucker Carlson Cooks Up Absurd New Scapegoat For Texas School Massacre,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson suggested that coronavirus pandemic lockdowns ― not guns ― were to blame for recent mass shootings in the U.S. On Wednesday, the Fox News host tried to connect recent shooting massacres in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas, to one of his favorite targets: COVID-19 mitigation measures. “Oh, so the lockdowns dramatically increase the incidence of mental illness among young people and in 10 days, we’ve seen two mass shootings by mentally ill young people. Could there be a connection?” he asked. “Now, that’s not finger-pointing. It’s not to blame [Dr. Anthony] Fauci for yesterday’s shooting. We’re not that low. We’re not Joe Biden. But if people are becoming mentally ill because they’re disconnected from others, what can we do to connect them to others and thereby reduce the incidence of mental illness? That’s a real conversation.” The shooters in Buffalo and Uvalde used assault rifles they had purchased legally. Both men were 18. The Buffalo gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in what authorities said was a racially motivated attack against the Black community. The Uvalde shooter killed 19 children and two teachers. Tucker: So the lockdowns dramatically increased the instance of mental illness among young people and in ten days, we’ve seen two mass shootings from mentally ill young people. Could there be a connection? pic.twitter.com/dbyXRrf6ik Many countries implemented lengthy and isolating lockdowns during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Australia and New Zealand, which have stricter gun control measures than the U.S., experienced some of the world’s longest lockdowns, yet saw no comparable shootings. Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since 1996, when a gunman opened fire at a tourist resort in Port Arthur, killing 35 people. The government responded by enacting strict gun control legislation, including banning all semi-automatic rifles. In New Zealand, all semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles were banned after a gunman killed 51 people in Christchurch in 2019. The government implemented a gun buy-back scheme so gun owners could be compensated for turning in their firearms. There hasn’t been a mass shooting in New Zealand since. Despite this evidence, Republicans largely remain opposed to tightening gun controls. And according to Carlson, strict gun control in the U.S. would cause “civil war.” “We will never get rid of all of those guns. The Constitution prohibits that and you would set off a civil war if you tried to do it,” he said. “So gun control, whether you find the slogans appealing or not, will not stop” the next mass shooters.

3,Jake Tapper Reportedly Taped Show At CNN Studio After Testing Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost CNN anchor Jake Tapper angered some network staffers earlier this month by taping a show at CNN’s Washington, D.C., bureau after testing positive for COVID-19, The Daily Beast reported Monday. Tapper tested positive for the virus while at the bureau on Monday May 9, just before taping his 4 p.m. ET. show, two people familiar with the situation told The Daily Beast’s media newsletter, Confider. However, he did not go home immediately, instead choosing to shoot “The Lead” on site. The following day, CNN’s Dana Bash filled in for Tapper. By Wednesday, he was back on air, filming from what appeared to be a home studio. CNN acknowledged that Tapper did the show after testing positive, but maintained he did not break any rules. “Testing is voluntary to enter our offices. It is mandatory to enter the studios. He tested shortly before his show,” a network spokesperson told Confider. “When he was notified of the positive result, he asked CNN execs what to do and then followed it to the letter ― he double-masked and isolated, did the show solo in a flash studio (single-person enclosed room) and went home immediately after.” “Everyone on ‘The Lead’ team was notified during their pre-show call that day. Jake had only been in direct contact with a few others, who were also notified,” the spokesperson added. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,"Harris, Surgeon General Warn Health Care Workers Are Burned Out From COVID-19 Pandemic",coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a warning Monday about burnout among the nation’s health care staff after more than two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential for severe worker shortages in the years ahead if the situation is not addressed. “You do so much to take care of your patients in their time of need,” Harris told health care workers as she visited Children’s National Hospital in Washington with Murthy on Monday. “Which is why I’m here to say, we need to do a better job of taking care of you.” Murthy issued a new report sounding the alarm over a projected shortage of 3 million “essential low-wage health workers” in the next five years, and nearly 140,000 doctors by 2033. “People are really struggling,” Murthy said. “After two years of COVID-19 and more than 1 million precious lives lost, the people we all turn to to keep us safe, to comfort us and help us heal, they have been pushed to their limits.” The administration is calling for new investments and steps to protect the mental wellbeing of health care workers; that includes expanding counseling offerings, reducing administrative burdens and promoting worker safety on the job. Unless changes are made, Murthy said, the country will be less prepared for future public health emergencies and “we will send a message to millions of healthcare workers that their suffering does not matter.” The initiative comes as the Biden administration is mounting a nationwide push to address mental health issues. President Joe Biden unveiled a national strategy to expand mental health and drug abuse treatment during his State of the Union address in March.

5,Pfizer Announces Dosage Of COVID Shots For Children Under 5,coronavirus," Three doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine offer strong protection for children younger than 5, the company announced Monday. Pfizer plans to give the data to U.S. regulators later this week in a step toward letting the littlest kids get the shots. The news comes after months of anxious waiting by parents desperate to vaccinate their babies, toddlers and preschoolers, especially as COVID-19 cases once again are rising. The 18 million tots under 5 are the only group in the U.S. not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. The Food and Drug Administration has begun evaluating data from rival Moderna, which hopes to begin offering two kid-sized shots by summer. Pfizer has had a bumpier time figuring out its approach. It aims to give tots an even lower dose — just one-tenth of the amount adults receive — but discovered during its trial that two shots didn’t seem quite strong enough for preschoolers. So researchers gave a third shot to more than 1,600 youngsters — from age 6 months to 4 years — during the winter surge of the omicron variant. In a press release, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said the extra shot did the trick, revving up tots’ levels of virus-fighting antibodies enough to meet FDA criteria for emergency use of the vaccine with no safety problems. Preliminary data suggested the three-dose series is 80% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, the companies said, but they cautioned the calculation is based on just 10 cases diagnosed among study participants by the end of April. The study rules state that at least 21 cases are needed to formally determine effectiveness, and Pfizer promised an update as soon as more data is available. The companies already had submitted data on the first two doses to the FDA, and BioNTech’s CEO, Dr. Ugur Sahin, said the final third-shot data would be submitted this week. “The study suggests that a low, 3-microgram dose of our vaccine, carefully selected based on tolerability data, provides young children with a high level of protection against the recent COVID-19 strains,” he said in a statement. What’s next? FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks has pledged the agency will “move quickly without sacrificing our standards” in evaluating tot-sized doses from both Pfizer and Moderna. The agency has set tentative dates next month for its scientific advisers to publicly debate data from each company. Moderna is seeking to be the first to vaccinate the littlest kids. It submitted data to the FDA saying tots develop high levels of virus-fighting antibodies after two shots that contain a quarter of the dose given to adults. The Moderna study found effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was 40% to 50% during the omicon surge, much like for adults who’ve only had two vaccine doses. Complicating Moderna’s progress, the FDA so far has allowed its vaccine to be used only in adults. The FDA is expected to review Moderna’s data on both the youngest age group, plus its study of teens and elementary-age children. Other countries already have expanded Moderna’s shot to kids as young as 6. While COVID-19 generally isn’t as dangerous to youngsters as to adults, some children do become severely ill or even die. And the omicron variant hit children especially hard, with those under 5 hospitalized at higher rates than at the peak of the previous delta surge. It’s not clear how much demand there will be to vaccinate the youngest kids. Pfizer shots for 5- to 11-year-olds opened in November, but only about 30% of that age group have gotten the recommended initial two doses. Last week, U.S. health authorities said elementary-age children should get a booster shot just like everyone 12 and older is supposed to get, for the best protection against the latest coronavirus variants. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

6,People In Counties That Backed Trump Were Twice As Likely To Die From COVID: Study,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Americans in counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump in 2020 were 2.26 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than in counties that voted for Joe Biden, according to a new analysis of data. The extra toll in Republican counties is significant, especially given that one million people have now died of COVID-19 in the U.S. National Public Radio examined deaths from COVID-19 per 100,000 people in roughly 3,000 counties across the country from May 2021, a time when most Americans could obtain vaccines. Those living in counties that voted 60% or higher for Trump in 2020 had 2.26 times the death rate of counties that voted in comparable percentages for Biden, NPR reported. Counties with a higher share of Trump votes had even higher mortality rates. While COVID-19 death rates in regions are affected by several factors, including things like wealth and access to health care, death rates closely followed rates of vaccinations, which Republican lawmakers, activists and media personalities often railed against. Not only did they urge people not to get the vaccine, but often spread frightening disinformation about the vaccines. According to an analysis released by Brown University this month, nearly 320,000 lives nationwide could have been saved if more people had chosen to get vaccinated. And political affiliation continues to be the largest predictor of vaccination status, according to the non-partisan think tank the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the NPR study, 81% of adults were vaccinated in the counties that went strongly for Biden, compared to 60% of adults in counties that went for Trump. The Brown study found that states that went most heavily for Trump ― including West Virginia and Wyoming ― had among the highest rates of preventable deaths. States that voted heavily for Biden ― such as Massachusetts and Vermont ― had among the lowest. Democratic areas initially suffered some of the highest death rates from the pandemic because COVID-19 first hit hardest in major metropolitan areas. But Republican areas surpassed those death rates once vaccines became available and residents there opted not to get them. Many COVID-19 deaths occurred in 2020 before vaccines were available. But half of the deaths after that could have been averted if all adults in an area were vaccinated, according to the Brown study. After the beginnings of the pandemic, which hit cities hardest, statistics gathered in various studies have consistently demonstrated significantly higher COVID-19 cases and death rates in Republican areas over Democratic areas. Some researchers predict the discrepancy will lessen over time with larger numbers surviving the disease, decreasing their chances of death from subsequent bouts. But Harvard University epidemiologist William Hange fears that politicians could continue to use vaccinations as a “wedge” issue for political gain, and could next target all vaccinations and seriously undermine American health. “It’s part of the long-term damage that happens when you have politicians relentlessly trying to denigrate it and turn it into a political football,” he told NPR.

7,How New Variants May Impact Your Chances Of COVID Reinfection,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Last year, it seemed as though coronavirus reinfections were rare. Yes, they happened, but the vast majority of people who had already had COVID likely wouldn’t contract the virus again anytime soon. But recent data suggest reinfections are becoming more common, especially as new variants take hold. New York’s health department recently published a report that shows a little over 4% of all COVID infections in the state have been reinfections — and that nearly 87% of them have occurred since December 2021. Washington state reported that 45,312 people had reported a reinfection since September 2021 — 2.3% of those were hospitalized and 0.2% died. The uptick in reinfections is likely influenced by two factors: one, that newer variants can evade the antibody response and reinfect, and two, that we’re now documenting reinfections more rigorously and getting a more accurate picture of how frequent they are. Coronaviruses are known to infect people over and over again. In fact, it’s widely believed that the common cold coronaviruses that circulate today (and reinfect people frequently) originated from previous coronavirus epidemics. Many infectious disease doctors suspect that, as with those strains, we may be susceptible to reinfections but that the symptoms will become milder and milder with time. “As get more immunity, as our T-cells diversity and broaden, hopefully our second reinfection will not feel as bad as the first infection,” said Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of California, San Francisco. We now know that antibodies, which work to prevent infection in the first place, begin to dip a few months after vaccination or infection. In addition, as the coronavirus mutated, it became slightly less recognizable to the immune system. Because of this, variants are able to outwit the immune system’s first line of defense and reinfect us, according to Julie Parsonnet, an epidemiologist and professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine. “With omicron, we are seeing many cases in previously infected people, even when they had been vaccinated as well,” Parsonnet said. “With omicron, we are seeing many cases in previously infected people, even when they had been vaccinated as well.” Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster, an assistant professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said that people who recently recovered from an infection or got boosted may be susceptible to reinfection in about six months. Parsonnet noted she’s heard of at least one patient who was fully vaccinated and double-boosted getting infected with omicron six weeks after their previous infection. A recent study from Denmark found that, though very rare, reinfections with omicron subvariants can occur in as little as 20 days. Of the 1.8 million infections recorded between November 2021 and February 2022, 1,739 reinfections were detected within 60 days. This doesn’t mean that a couple of months after recovering, there’s a good chance you’ll get COVID again. In fact, a pre-print study recently found that infections in people who have already had COVID were 90% less common than in people who had never been infected. Getting infected on top of the vaccine really boosts your antibody levels, and that should keep most people well-protected from infection for at least four months, Gandhi said. Identifying who may be more likely to get reinfected isn’t an exact science — some people will be better protected and less at risk for reinfections depending on factors like their age, genetics and underlying health. The rate of reinfection also depends on the variant — the type of mutations the virus has picked up — and the viral load someone’s exposed to, according to Penaloza-MacMaster. The bulk of evidence suggests that COVID reinfections, in general, tend to be less severe than the initial infection. In the Danish study, almost everyone who had been reinfected with BA.2 after previously having BA.1 experienced mild symptoms for a few days and significantly lower viral loads the second time around — even those who were unvaccinated. Even though our immune system weakens with time, the components that keep us safe from illness and severe outcomes remain robust and long-lasting (even when dealing with new variants). “Reinfections, especially in vaccinated individuals, are typically milder relative to the primary infection, because there is already an arsenal of memory T-cells and B-cells,” Penaloza-MacMaster said. Research suggests reinfections and boosters enhance the T-cell response. “As you would expect, a reinfection fundamentally protects you even more” from severe outcomes, Gandhi said. Of course, boosters are the safest ― you don’t want to purposefully get reinfected. According to Penaloza-MacMaster, the severity of an individual’s reinfection is also influenced by the variant they contract along with the dose of virus they are exposed to and whether they have underlying health conditions that put them at risk. But, often, it can be unpredictable. One of the key questions epidemiologists will track is how reinfections contribute to long COVID. We know that COVID affects many organs, including the brain, lungs and heart. Inflammation, which helps clear infected cells from the body, is a normal part of the body’s response to infections. When the body kills off virally infected cells, it also destroys our own healthy cells. “Eliminating a virus involves a substantial amount of ‘collateral damage,’ which is a main reason why long-term inflammation ― which happens during protracted infections ― is harmful,” Penaloza-MacMaster said. If and how reinfections contribute to long COVID and potential damage to our organs is unclear. Research has found that vaccination reduced the risk of long COVID in people who had a breakthrough infection, Gandhi said. And while the vast majority of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 recover well without long-term consequences, it isn’t yet known whether this will continue to be the case after multiple infections. “We don’t know the answer to this question, especially because as variants change and our immune systems react differently to them, their impacts on the body many change,” Parsonnet said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

8,CDC: Kids Ages 5 to 11 Should Obtain Booster Of COVID-19 Vaccine,coronavirus," Kids ages 5 to 11 should get a booster dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, advisers to the U.S. government said Thursday. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention quickly adopted the panel’s recommendation, opening a third COVID-19 shot to healthy elementary-age kids — just like what is already recommended for everybody 12 and older. The hope is that an extra shot will shore up protection for kids ages 5 to 11 as infections once again are on the rise. “Vaccination with a primary series among this age group has lagged behind other age groups leaving them vulnerable to serious illness,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a statement. “We know that these vaccines are safe, and we must continue to increase the number of children who are protected,” she said. Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer’s kid-sized booster, to be offered at least five months after the youngsters’ last shot. The CDC takes the next step of recommending who actually needs vaccinations. Its advisers debated if all otherwise healthy 5- to 11-year-olds need an extra dose, especially since so many children were infected during the huge winter surge of the omicron variant. But the U.S. now is averaging 100,000 new cases a day for the first time since February. And ultimately, the CDC’s advisers pointed to growing evidence from older kids and adults that two primary vaccinations plus a booster are providing the best protection against the newest coronavirus variants. “This always perhaps should have been a three-dose vaccine,” said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs the CDC’s advisory panel. The booster question isn’t the hottest vaccine topic: Parents still are anxiously awaiting a chance to vaccinate kids under 5 — the only group not yet eligible in the U.S. Dr. Doran Fink of the Food and Drug Administration said the agency is working “as rapidly as we can” to evaluate an application from vaccine maker Moderna, and is awaiting final data on the littlest kids from rival Pfizer. The FDA’s own advisers are expected to publicly debate data from one or both companies next month. For the 5- to 11-year-olds, it’s not clear how much booster demand there will be. Only about 30% of that age group have had the initial two Pfizer doses since vaccinations opened to them in November. CDC adviser Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University said health authorities must put more effort into getting youngsters their initial shots. “That needs to be a priority,” she said. Thursday’s decision also means that 5- to 11-year-olds with severely weakened immune systems, who are supposed to get three initial shots, would be eligible for a fourth dose. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech currently make the only COVID-19 vaccine available for children of any age in the U.S. Those ages 5 to 11 receive a dose that’s one-third the amount given to everyone 12 and older. In a small study, Pfizer found a booster revved up those kids’ levels of virus-fighting antibodies — including those able to fight the super-contagious omicron variant — the same kind of jump adults get from an extra shot. Vaccines may not always prevent milder infections, and the omicron variant proved especially able to slip past their defenses. But CDC cited data during the omicron surge that showed unvaccinated 5- to 11-year-olds had twice the rate of hospitalization as youngsters who got their first two doses. Health authorities say for all ages, the vaccines are still offering strong protection against COVID-19′s worst outcomes, especially after a third dose. Some especially high-risk people, including those 50 and older, have been offered the choice of a second booster, or fourth shot — and the CDC on Thursday strengthened that recommendation, too, urging anyone who’s eligible to go ahead and get the extra dose. Still to be decided is whether everyone will need additional shots in the fall, possibly reformulated to offer better protection against newer coronavirus variants. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

9,The One Thing You Should Do If Your At-Home COVID Test Is Positive,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Travel Editor, HuffPost I got COVID for the first time in April. When I woke up on a Friday morning, I had a sneaky suspicion my slight nasal congestion was something more insidious. Within 30 seconds, an at-home rapid antigen test confirmed it. My friends were surprised by my positive result; it was before the current wave had really taken off ― at least, as far as they knew. Most people were lured into a false sense of security after the original omicron strain ripped through New York City. The numbers were low, or so we all thought. What likely happened ― and is still happening ― was that case rates were higher than official stats indicated. Thanks to the improved availability of at-home tests, more people are finding out they’re sick on their own. The days of going to get tested are dwindling. “Right now, COVID infection rates are being underreported all around the country, so we are actually getting falsely low numbers of infections. Therefore, health authorities may feel COVID is under control when it is not and be misled in their planning and recommendation making,” said Dr. Michael Blaivas, chief medical officer at Anavasi Diagnostics. Accurate case counts help people make informed decisions about their health. They’re also vital for community leaders, hospitals and more. “If infections are spiking, the government may need to allocate additional resources for COVID care in hospitals, clinics and potentially take other steps like asking people to wear masks again,” Blaivas said. “Staffing at your local hospital may be impacted by falsely low numbers and, if lots of people start showing up sick, they may not have the staff to care for everyone.” “COVID infection rates are being underreported all around the country, so we are actually getting falsely low numbers of infections. Therefore, health authorities may feel COVID is under control when it is not.” If we’re going to live in a world with COVID for a long time ― as so many experts have stated ― we need to know when we’re experiencing surges. “Until recently and the advent of home testing, essentially all tests were reported to the CDC and various states. Policymakers and health authorities knew very quickly when COVID was exploding and when it was getting under control,” Blaivas said, noting that an inaccurate representation of cases may mean hospitals aren’t equipped to handle serious illness and ICU admissions. “Also, remember all of the shortages of masks, disinfectants and medications early on in COVID?” Blaivas continued. “When authorities are unaware of infection numbers, they cannot work to accumulate supplies or at least ensure availability when people start getting really sick in large numbers. That puts everyone in danger.” Finally, accurate case numbers allow researchers to prepare future treatments and prevention measures. I’m vaccinated and boosted and likely contracted the omicron BA.2 subvariant, since it’s now the dominant strain. Thankfully, because of my vaccine, my case wasn’t serious. This is useful information for scientists. “Positive test results help give us valuable information with regards to how vaccines are holding up against different variants,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine physician. “Ultimately, all of this information can be put together and influence health experts’ ultimate recommendations and guidance.” There are multiple avenues you can take to log your case, depending on where you live. The first, most logical step would be calling and telling your primary doctor. “Your doctor might find it prudent to intervene with some of the available treatment options, [which] can depend on your overall health or vaccination status,” Cherian said. However, Blaivas said that you cannot always assume that your doctor will report your case to the city or the state if they did not run the test themselves. Many at-home rapid tests have an app associated with them, where you can receive or report your test result by scanning a QR code printed on the test. “In some cases, you will need to reach out to your health department,” Blaivas added. “This may be calling them, or for some states, you can go to the state health website and report a COVID infection by filling out their online forms.” The stressful and unfortunate reality is that we’re in a COVID wave ― and it certainly won’t be the last. Accurate numbers help us know when we’re approaching a surge and encourage us to take extra precautions to protect ourselves and others. At-home tests are a great public health tool, but they’re not being used to their fullest advantage if the case isn’t logged. Make sure you do that, along with taking care of yourself. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

2,North Korea's Suspected COVID-19 Outbreak Nears 2 Million,coronavirus," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Thursday reported 262,270 more suspected COVID-19 cases as its pandemic caseload neared 2 million — a week after the country acknowledged the outbreak and scrambled to slow infections in its unvaccinated population. The country is also trying to prevent its fragile economy from deteriorating further, but the outbreak could be worse than officially reported since the country lacks virus tests and other health care resources and may be underreporting deaths to soften the political impact on authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea’s anti-virus headquarters reported a single additional death, raising its toll to 63, which experts have said is abnormally small compared to the suspected number of coronavirus infections. The official Korean Central News Agency said more than 1.98 million people have become sick with fever since late April. Most are believed to have COVID-19, though only a few omicron variant infections have been confirmed. At least 740,160 people are in quarantine, the news agency reported. North Korea’s outbreak comes amid a provocative streak of weapons demonstrations, including its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in nearly five years in March. Experts don’t believe the COVID-19 outbreak will slow Kim’s brinkmanship aimed at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and negotiating economic and security concessions from a position of strength. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence shows there’s a “genuine possibility” that North Korea will conduct another ballistic missile test or nuclear test around President Joe Biden’s visit to South Korea and Japan that begins later this week. After maintaining a dubious claim that it had kept the virus out of the country for two and a half years, North Korea acknowledged its first COVID-19 infections May 12 and has described a rapid spread since. Kim has called the outbreak a “great upheaval,” berated officials for letting the virus spread and restricted the movement of people and supplies between cities and regions. Workers were mobilized to find people with suspected COVID-19 symptoms who were then sent to quarantine — the main method of curbing the outbreak since North Korea is short of medical supplies and intensive care units that lowered COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in other nations. State media images showed health workers in hazmat suits guarding Pyongyang’s closed-off streets, disinfecting buildings and streets and delivering food and other supplies to apartment blocks. Despite the vast numbers of sick people and the efforts to curb the outbreak, state media describe large groups of workers continuing to gather at farms, mining facilities, power stations and construction sites. Experts say North Korea cannot afford a lockdown that would hinder production in an economy already broken by mismanagement, crippling U.S.-led sanctions over Kim’s nuclear weapons ambitions and pandemic border closures. North Korea also must urgently work to protect its crops from a drought that hit during the crucial rice-planting season — a worrisome development in a country that has long suffered from food insecurity. State media also said that Kim’s trophy construction projects, including the building of 10,000 new houses in the town of Hwasong, are being “propelled as scheduled.” “All sectors of the national economy are stepping up the production to the maximum while strictly observing the anti-epidemic steps taken by the party and the state,” Korean Central News Agency reported. The virus controls at workplaces include separating workers by their job classifications and quarantining worker units at construction sites and in its key metal, chemical, electricity and coal industries, KCNA said. Kee Park, a global health specialist at Harvard Medical School who has worked on health care projects in North Korea, said the country’s number of new cases should start to slow because of the strengthened preventive measures. But it will be challenging for North Korea to provide treatment for the already large number of people with COVID-19. Deaths may possibly approach tens of thousands, considering the size of its caseload, and international assistance would be crucial, Park said. “The best way to prevent these deaths are to treat with antivirals like Paxlovid,” which would significantly lower the risk of severe disease or death, Park said. “This is much faster and easier to implement than sending ventilators to build ICU capacity.” Other experts say providing a small number of vaccines for high-risk groups such as the elderly would prevent deaths, though mass vaccinations would be impossible at this stage for the population of 26 million. It’s unclear, however, if North Korea would accept outside help. It already shunned vaccines offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program, and the nation’s leaders have expressed confidence the country can overcome the crisis on its own. Kim Tae-hyo, deputy national security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, told reporters on Thursday that North Korea has ignored offers of help from South Korea and the United States to contain the outbreak. Experts have said North Korea may be more willing to accept help from China, its main ally. South Korea’s government had said it couldn’t confirm media reports that North Korea flew planes to bring back emergency supplies from China this week."

6,U.S. Reaches Devastating 1 Million Deaths From COVID-19,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost The nation has reached a heartbreaking milestone of 1 million confirmed deaths from COVID-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began over two years ago. An average of over 300 people are still dying each day from COVID-19 — most of whom are unvaccinated — even as safe and effective vaccines have been available to prevent severe illness or death from the virus. “We mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Thursday, ordering flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and other federal grounds. “Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic.” The president asked Americans to “remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible.” Although hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 have fallen from their winter peak, new cases have begun to rise again, doubling since April, as highly contagious omicron subvariants spread across the country and hospitalizations are ticking back up. Some 22% — or nearly 1 in 4 — people nationwide have still not gotten a single dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. About one-third — or 33% — of the population has not been fully vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines or the single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s. And about half of people eligible for a booster — which health experts say provides the best protection against the latest variants — have not gotten theirs. Throughout the deadly pandemic, right-wing media pundits have spread misinformation on the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, and Republican lawmakers and officials have fought efforts to mandate vaccines for workers. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky noted in February that unvaccinated people were 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted. Meanwhile, federal and state-level guidelines have dramatically loosened virus-related restrictions in recent months, with many states lifting mask mandates for schools and a court ruling ending a national mask mandate for planes and other travel. (The CDC still recommends masking on planes, trains and buses.) People with disabilities have warned that the millions of Americans with chronic health conditions, including those who are immunocompromised or have heart or respiratory issues, are still vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, Black and Latinx people have faced disproportionate hospitalization and death from the virus, as these communities are overrepresented among front-line workers, in industries like agriculture or in the service sector, where employees aren’t able to work from home as the virus spreads. Black and Latinx people are more than twice as likely as white people to be hospitalized with the virus, and nearly twice as likely to die from it. Reporter, HuffPost"
7,"U.S. Cities Step Up Their COVID Guidance, But Stop Short Of Imposing Mandates",coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Cities and health agencies across the country are stepping up their recommendations for measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, but stopping short of imposing sweeping mandates. The measures come as the omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1 continues to spread in the country, almost overtaking BA.2, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending on May 14. The New York City Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene issued an advisory Monday calling on people to mask up in indoor places, including stores and offices, irrespective of vaccination status, as cases have been steadily rising and “increasing pressure on the health system.” Still, Eric Adams, New York City’s mayor, is not mandating the wearing of face masks. “We are not at the point of doing anything other than urging New Yorkers, while you are indoors in large settings, social settings, wear your masks,” Adams said, according to The New York Times. “If there comes a time that our hospitals are in a state of emergency, or we’re trending that way, and my doctors that run the hospitals tell me this is what we need to do, I’m going to listen to them,” he continued. Los Angeles is also facing similar pressures, as COVID-positive hospitalizations are trending upward in Los Angeles County, rising by 29% compared to last week, according to the Los Angeles Times. On Monday, Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, also called on people to wear masks in closed spaces to limit the “spread while we continue to increase the numbers of residents and workers up to date with their vaccinations,” in a statement reported in the LA Times. Both New York City and LA County continue to require masks on public transportation. The CDC is also now recommending testing before domestic travel, no more than three days before the date of the trip, without citing different guidance for fully vaccinated passengers. The Biden administration is also doubling the COVID tests households are allowed to order at home for free. Households will now be able to order up to eight at-home rapid tests. The White House’s announcement on testing also took a jab at Congress for failing to pass COVID funding, warning this may compromise the nation’s preparedness to deal with the pandemic. “Due to Congress’s failure to provide additional funding for the nation’s COVID-19 response, the Administration cannot continue making the types of federal investments needed to sustain domestic testing manufacturing capacity, and this may jeopardize the federal government’s ability to provide free tests moving forward,” the statement read. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s COVID-19 response coordinator, acknowledged the rise in infections and encouraged people to take a rapid COVID test before attending parties and before visiting vulnerable family members. “We’ve worked hard to get these tests and with cases rising, it’s a good time to get more out to Americans,” he tweeted Tuesday. Going to a large gathering? Use rapid tests to not be the person who brings COVID to the partyVisiting a vulnerable relative? Use rapids tests to keep them safeWe've worked hard to get these tests and with cases rising, its a good time to get more out to Americans The White House COVID-19 response team and public health officials, including Dr. Jha, the president’s chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, will hold a press briefing Wednesday to provide updates on the country’s response to the pandemic. President Joe Biden marked the grim milestone of 1 million COVID deaths last week. “We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible,” Biden said.

8,"Vaccine Skeptic Eric Clapton Contracts COVID, Cancels Shows Because He’s ‘Anxious’",coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost British rocker Eric Clapton, a critic of coronavirus vaccines and pandemic restrictions, has tested positive for COVID and canceled two upcoming gigs because he is “anxious” about spreading the virus to colleagues and fans. Clapton’s upcoming shows in Zurich on Tuesday and Milan on Wednesday will be rescheduled, he announced on his official Facebook page Monday. The 77-year-old tested positive following his concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall on May 8. “He has been told by his medical advisors that if he were to resume traveling and performing too soon, it could substantially delay his full recovery,” the Facebook post said. “Eric is also anxious to avoid passing on any infection to any of his band, crew, promoters, their staff and of course, the fans.” “It is very frustrating that having avoided Covid throughout lockdown and throughout the period when travel restrictions have been in place Eric should have succumbed to Covid at this point in time,” it added. “But we very much hope he will be sufficiently recovered by the end of the week to be able to perform the remainder of the planned performances.” In 2020, Clapton produced an anti-lockdown song titled “Stand and Deliver” with Van Morrison. It featured the lyrics: “Do you want to be a free man, or do you want to be a slave?” The musician’s 2021 song “This Has Gotta Stop” riffed on a similar theme. Clapton said he experienced “severe” reactions to the AstraZeneca vaccine. It led him to criticize assurances about the vaccines as “propaganda.” Millions worldwide have received the shots and scientists say there is no doubt the vaccines drastically cut the risks of serious illness and death against all forms of the coronavirus. Clapton also has suggested people who received the jabs were victims of “subliminal advertising.” He previously vowed not to perform at venues requiring fans to show proof of vaccination, but he broke that promise at a gig in New Orleans.

0,Should You Mix And Match COVID Boosters For Your Fourth Dose?,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Now that people who are over 50 or those who are immunocompromised are eligible for a second COVID booster, you may be wondering whether you should switch up the type of vaccine you get for your fourth dose. Evidence suggests that doing so for the third dose produces a stronger, more robust immune response, likely because the vaccines stimulate our immune system in different ways. Although there isn’t much data on the fourth dose, infectious disease experts suspect that mixing up your second booster will be similarly beneficial. While there may be a slight edge to mixing vaccines, you’ll still be well protected against severe outcomes if you decide to stick with the same type of shot for your second booster, according to infectious diseases experts. The one caveat is that anyone who initially got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will want to follow up with one of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna as evidence consistently shows they provide stronger protection. But the mRNAs boost each other well and can be safely interchanged. “When it comes to the numbers that matter the most, which is preventing hospitalization, severe disease and death, there is literally no difference,” Onyema Ogbuagu, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist, told HuffPost. The data is limited on how mixing vaccines for your fourth dose specifically impacts protection, but prior research shows that the mix-and-match strategy with the first three doses provided a broader immune response. A study from the National Institutes of Health found that boosting with a different type of shot than what was previously administered was associated with higher antibody levels than people who boosted with the same type of shot. “If you switched, you actually had more of an immunologic response than if you just continued with the same vaccine,” said Robert Murphy, a Northwestern Medicine infectious diseases doctor. This is likely because the body responds to the vaccines differently, which ultimately helps produce a broader immune response. “I think that there is evidence that mixing and matching between the mRNA vaccines may have some benefit because they slightly stimulate the immune system in different ways,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Adalja believes this same biological principle would apply to the fourth dose, too. The benefits of switching up doses appears to be most pronounced in people who originally got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “Getting an mRNA boost on top of a J&J primary results in higher antibody levels and higher clinical protection than J&J on top of J&J,” Ogbuagu said. For those who initially got the J&J shot, it’s recommended that they boost with either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. The mRNA shots are pretty comparable, according to Ogbuagu. “The mRNAs boost each other well, but Moderna probably has a little bit of an edge,” he said. This is likely because Moderna has a higher antigen dose and longer dosing interval compared to Pfizer. A study evaluating the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines recently found that people who’ve received the Moderna shot had more antibodies within the mucus lining in the nose, which helps prevent infection. At this point, though, experts say it’s fine to go for the other type of mRNA shot or stick with what you’ve had. Both do a great job of stimulating robust immune responses against variants. “There is no formal recommendation,” Murphy said. “People can just continue with the one they had or they can switch to the other one.” Some people have been holding out on a fourth dose for an updated vaccine. While we may eventually have variant-specific or pan-coronavirus vaccines, it’s unclear when they may be available. Murphy advised against waiting for an updated shot, as the risk is now. The omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 are already ripping through the population. Ogbuagu thinks the case numbers that we are seeing now — close to 100,000 cases a day — are grossly underestimated since so many rely on at-home rapid tests that go unreported and therefore aren’t included in official case counts. We know that staying on top of the current vaccines and getting boosted when eligible restores protection against severe outcomes, even with new variants. “We are in the midst of another wave of infections and so the time is now to get this,” Ogbuagu said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,Why The 'Explosive' COVID-19 Outbreak In North Korea Is So Alarming,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost North Korea declared a “maximum emergency” on Thursday after officials announced the country’s first outbreak of COVID-19, a bleak moment for the reclusive nation as most of its citizens remain unvaccinated against the virus. Just a day later, North Korea said a new fever had spread “explosively” across the nation, infecting at least 350,000 people since April and causing at least six deaths, including one confirmed to be linked to the coronavirus. At least 18,000 people were diagnosed with the fever nationwide on Thursday alone, and more than 187,000 people were being isolated and treated. “A fever whose cause couldn’t be identified explosively spread nationwide from late April, and more than 350,000 people got fever in a short span of time,” North Korea’s state-run KCNA said Friday. The agency added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed: “It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our Party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date, restore the stability of epidemic prevention and protect the health and wellbeing of our people.” The figures echo what many other countries experienced at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. But for North Korea, which has effectively sequestered itself the past two years and maintained an iron grip on its people, the outbreak presents a stark public health challenge and raises deep concern that it could prompt a humanitarian crisis. State media said Thursday that authorities had found the first case of the highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus, a rare admission from Pyongyang. All North Korean cities and counties were ordered into strict lockdown to prevent any spread. NK News reported some experts believe North Korea’s large-scale military parade on April 25 could have been a superspreader event that triggered the current outbreak. Tens of thousands of maskless North Koreans participated in the event, which celebrated the 90th anniversary of the country’s military. Kim himself wore a mask in public on Thursday, the first time he’s believed to have done so. Yonhap News said the decision likely demonstrates the troubling situation North Korea is in with the latest outbreak. The New York Times noted that North Korea has not accepted any COVID-19 vaccine donations from other nations and has a woefully under-prepared public health system. Any strain on its health infrastructure would also be exacerbated by two years of border closures with China, its main trading partner, and fierce United Nations sanctions over its ballistic weapons programs. Joshua Pollack, the editor of the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review and a close follower of North Korea, said the country’s years-long strategy to keep COVID-19 out only imperiled it when the virus eventually arrived. “North Korea’s weak public health system has pushed them into a corner: to keep COVID out, they have sealed the borders right [up],” he wrote on Twitter. “But this also keeps most food and medical imports out. The public is vulnerable.” For now, North Korea seems to be relying on a lockdown in Pyongyang to handle the outbreak. But it’s almost bound to be more than one case by now. The country can’t be sealed perfectly forever. https://t.co/NuH8KAsc1p South Korean officials have expressed hope that any request for aid from the North could help restart diplomatic talks that have languished for years. Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which focuses on relations between the two nations, said the country would provide medical assistance and other help to the North if requested, The Associated Press reported. The United States said Thursday it had no immediate plans to share vaccines with Pyongyang, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki accusing the Kim regime of focusing more on military power than medical supplies. “We do continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans, and this is, of course, a broader part of the DPRK continuing to exploit its own citizens by not accepting this type of aid,” Psaki said Thursday. “It’s not just vaccines. It’s also a range of humanitarian assistance that could very much help the people and the country, and instead they divert resources to build their unlawful nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Joe Biden Co-Hosting 2nd COVID Summit As World's Resolve Falters,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will appeal for a renewed international commitment to attacking COVID-19 as he convenes the second global COVID-19 summit at a time when faltering resolve at home jeopardizes that global response. Eight months after he used the first such summit to announce an ambitious pledge to donate 1.2 billion vaccine doses to the world, the urgency of the U.S. and other nations to respond has waned. Momentum on vaccinations and treatments has faded even as new, more infectious variants rise and billions across the globe remain unprotected. Congress has refused to meet Biden’s request to provide another $22.5 billion in what he has called critically needed aid funding. The White House said Biden will address the opening of the virtual summit Thursday morning with prerecorded remarks and will make the case that addressing COVID-19 “must remain an international priority.” The U.S. is co-hosting the summit along with Germany, Indonesia, Senegal and Belize. The U.S. has shipped nearly 540 million vaccine doses to more than 110 countries and territories, according to the State Department — by far more than any other donor nation. After the delivery of more than 1 billion vaccines to the developing world, the problem is no longer that there aren’t enough shots, but a lack of logistical support to get doses into arms. According to government data, more than 680 million donated vaccine doses have been left unused in developing countries because they were set to expire soon and couldn’t be administered quickly enough. As of March, 32 poorer countries had used fewer than half of the COVID-19 vaccines they were sent. U.S. assistance to promote and facilitate vaccinations overseas dried up earlier this year, and Biden has requested about $5 billion for the effort through the rest of the year. “We have tens of millions of unclaimed doses because countries lack the resources to build out their cold chains, which basically is the refrigeration systems; to fight  disinformation; and to hire vaccinators,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. She added that the summit is “going to be an opportunity to elevate the fact that we need additional funding to continue to be a part of this effort around the world.” “We’re going to continue to fight for more funding here,” Psaki said. “But we will continue to press other countries to do more to help the world make progress as well.” Congress has balked at the price tag for COVID-19 relief and has thus far refused to take up the package because of political opposition to the impending end of pandemic-era migration restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even after a consensus for virus funding briefly emerged in March, lawmakers decided to strip out the global aid funding and solely focus the assistance on shoring up U.S. supplies of vaccine booster shots and therapeutics. Biden has warned that without Congress acting, the U.S. could lose out on access to the next generation of vaccines and treatments, and that the nation won’t have enough supply of booster doses or the antiviral drug Paxlovid for later this year. He’s also sounding the alarm that more variants will spring up if the U.S. and the world don’t do more to contain the virus globally. “To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,” Biden said last September during the first global summit. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere.""President Joe Biden spoke with world leaders Wednesday and pledged another half-billion vaccines to be sent to low- and middle-income countries around the world. pic.twitter.com/4o9f1q2EBp The virus has killed more than 995,000 people in the U.S. and at least 6.2 million globally, according to figures kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines has dropped in some countries as infections and deaths have declined globally in recent months, particularly as the omicron variant has proved to be less severe than earlier versions of the disease. For the first time since it was created, the U.N.-backed COVAX effort has “enough supply to enable countries to meet their national vaccination targets,” according to vaccines alliance Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley, which fronts COVAX. Still, despite more than 65% of the world’s population receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, fewer than 16% of people in poor countries have been immunized. It is highly unlikely countries will hit the World Health Organization target of vaccinating 70% of all people by June. In countries including Cameroon, Uganda and the Ivory Coast, officials have struggled to get enough refrigerators to transport vaccines, send enough syringes for mass campaigns and get enough health workers to inject the shots. Experts also point out that more than half of the health workers needed to administer the vaccines in poorer countries are either underpaid or not paid at all. Donating more vaccines, critics say, would miss the point entirely. “It’s like donating a bunch of fire trucks to countries that are on fire, but they have no water,” said Ritu Sharma, a vice president at the charity CARE, which has helped immunize people in more than 30 countries, including India, South Sudan and Bangladesh. “We can’t be giving countries all these vaccines but no way to use them,” she said, adding that the same infrastructure that got the shots administered in the U.S. is now needed elsewhere. “We had to tackle this problem in the U.S., so why are we not now using that knowledge to get vaccines into the people who need them most?” Sharma said greater investment was needed to counter vaccine hesitancy in developing countries where there are entrenched beliefs about the potential dangers of Western-made medicines. “Leaders must agree to pursue a coherent strategy to end the pandemic instead of a fragmented approach that will extend the lifespan of this crisis,” said Gayle Smith, CEO of The ONE Campaign. GAVI’s Berkley also said that countries are increasingly asking for the pricier messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, which are not as easily available as the AstraZeneca vaccine, which made up the bulk of COVAX’s supply last year. The emergence of variants like delta and omicron have led many countries to switch to mRNA vaccines, which seem to provide more protection and are in greater demand globally than traditionally made vaccines like AstraZeneca, Novavax or those made by China and Russia. ___ Cheng reported from London."
3,Experts Predict If And When COVID Will Become A Seasonal Illness,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost The vast majority of respiratory viruses that spread within our population ebb and flow with the seasons. Influenza spikes in the winter months, as do infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses and other coronaviruses. Earlier this year, Rochelle Walensky, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, said she expects COVID to also become a seasonal illness — but whether or not that will come to be remains to be seen. Most scientists agree that COVID isn’t going anywhere, and that we’ll be living with SARS-CoV-2 for decades, if not forever. Though we tend to see the biggest waves in the winter and early spring, COVID isn’t seasonal yet. It doesn’t retreat in the spring-to-summer off-season — it is smoldering throughout the year. “COVID is steadily burning through the population as we speak. But it is also able to piggy back on top of our ebbs and flows of the typical cold and flu season, so it’s a double whammy,” Mark Cameron, an infectious disease researcher at Case Western Reserve, told HuffPost. Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist and demographer who studies infectious diseases at University of California, Irvine, expects COVID to become winter-dominant, like the flu, in the long run. SARS-CoV-2 is already somewhat seasonal and predictable in nature. “In the United States, all of the largest spikes have been in the winter, so it is kind of seasonal in that respect,” Noymer said. But, even between those peaks, the virus spreads at pretty significant levels. It hasn’t totally settled into a seasonality. Many epidemiologists thought COVID would have already fallen into much more of a seasonal pattern by now — but it hasn’t. “A seasonal infectious disease is something that pops up predictably at the start of the cold and flu season and persists throughout that period of time,” Cameron said. Keep in mind, this is only our third 12-month period with COVID. The illness is still relatively new. Even though over half of the U.S. population has likely already had COVID, many have not and remain susceptible. We’re all antsy for the virus to become predictable, but the virus is still just getting started, Noymer said. He suspects that one day — maybe 10, 15 years from now — we’ll be looking at a very seasonal phenomenon. Is there a chance COVID may never sync up with the flu and cold season and become a winter-dominant illness? Of course, Noymer said. “I can’t absolutely rule out that it never will — that it will be the one exception that disproves the rule.” The fact that, one, people can get COVID multiple times, and two, that even vaccinated people can catch and spread COVID, makes the epidemiology of this respiratory infection chaotic. Population-level immunity influences when waves occur. After people recover from COVID, they are typically protected from infection for a few months. As time passes, those recently recovered people can become susceptible again. And, on a greater scale, a population can become susceptible to a wave again. This isn’t an exact science — people get infected and recover at different times. Their immunity wanes at different speeds. “There’s a lot of wheels turning and it’s very hard to predict,” Noymer said. It’s not entirely clear why respiratory viruses tend to get more active in the wintertime — but they do. Flu activity surges in the winter as do the common cold coronaviruses. Even measles was winter-dominant when it circulated at higher levels in the U.S., according to Noymer. “We see this with respiratory virus after respiratory virus after respiratory virus,” Noymer said. There are a few hypotheses as to why this happens. The first theory is atmospheric conditions — viruses, including influenza, tend to spread more easily when there’s less humidity. Viruses do better in drier conditions. Another contributing factor is our behavior. In winter months, when it’s cold outside, we gather indoors together and create plenty of opportunities for viruses to spread from person to person. This is also believed to be why the South experiences summer spikes. Contrary to those in the northeast, people living in the South head indoors during the summer months when the temperature soars and humidity becomes wet and sticky. Schools are thought to contribute to the seasonal spread of respiratory viruses like flu and RSV, Noymer added. The behavior of the virus plays a role, too. The flu, for example, tends to shoot through the population then burn itself out by “mutating to its demise,” Cameron said. COVID, on the other hand, is evolving to become more fit and more transmissible — it’s not acting like a typical respiratory virus that infects people and goes away before bursting back into the population in a different form months later. If we look to other circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, we can reasonably expect COVID to eventually become endemic and more seasonal in nature, according to Cameron. But we don’t know when those coronaviruses settled in their seasonality. How long that will take with COVID is a mystery. This is wide-open territory that has yet to be studied. “How can we understand how long COVID will take to become just another garden-variety coronavirus that is circulating and causing sporadic disease?” Cameron said. “It certainly isn’t now.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

4,North Korea Orders Nationwide Lockdown After Confirming 1st COVID-19 Case,coronavirus," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea imposed a nationwide lockdown Thursday to control its first acknowledged COVID-19 outbreak after holding for more than two years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world. The outbreak forced leader Kim Jong Un to wear a mask in public, likely for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but the scale of transmissions inside North Korea wasn’t immediately known. A failure to slow infections could have serious consequences because the country has a poor health care system and its 26 million people are believed to be mostly unvaccinated. Some experts say North Korea, by its rare admission of an outbreak, may be seeking outside aid. The official Korean Central News Agency said tests of samples collected Sunday from an unspecified number of people with fevers in the capital, Pyongyang, confirmed they were infected with the omicron variant. In response, Kim called at a ruling party Politburo meeting for a thorough lockdown of cities and counties and said workplaces should be isolated by units to block the virus from spreading. He urged health workers to step up disinfection efforts at workplaces and homes and mobilize reserve medical supplies. Kim said it was crucial to control transmissions and eliminate the infection source as fast as possible, while also easing inconveniences to the public caused by the virus controls. He insisted the country will overcome the outbreak because its government and people are “united as one.” Despite the elevated virus response, Kim ordered officials to push ahead with scheduled construction, agricultural development and other state projects while bolstering the country’s defense posture to avoid any security vacuum. North Korea’s state TV showed Kim and other senior officials wearing masks as they entered a meeting room, although Kim removed his mask to speak into a set of microphones. Still photos distributed by KNCA showed Kim unmasked and sitting at the head of a table where all other officials remained masked. South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, couldn’t immediately confirm whether it was the first time state media showed Kim wearing a mask since the start of the pandemic. Kim has previously spoken to huge crowds without a mask as he praised the country’s earlier pandemic response, and his decision to be seen with a mask could be aimed at raising public vigilance. North Korea, which has maintained strict anti-virus controls at its borders for more than two years, didn’t provide further details about its new lockdown. But an Associated Press photographer on the South Korean side of the border saw dozens of people working in fields or walking on footpaths at a North Korean border town — an indication the lockdown doesn’t require people to stay home, or it exempts farm work. The measures described in state media and Kim’s declaration that economic goals should still be met could indicate that North Korea is focusing more on restricting travel and supplies between regions, analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea’s Sejong Institute said. North Korea’s government has shunned vaccines offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program, possibly because they have international monitoring requirements. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said South Korea is willing to provide medical assistance and other help to North Korea based on humanitarian considerations. Relations between the Koreas have deteriorated since 2019 amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations and the North’s increasingly provocative weapons tests. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing is offering North Korea help in dealing with the outbreak. North Korea has reportedly rejected previous Chinese offers of domestically developed vaccines. Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Seoul’s Korea University College of Medicine, said North Korea is likely signaling its willingness to receive outside vaccines, but wants many more doses than offered by COVAX to inoculate its entire population multiple times. He said North Korea would also want COVID-19 medicines and medical equipment shipments that are banned by U.N. sanctions. Omicron spreads much more easily than earlier variants of the coronavirus, and its fatality and hospitalization rates are high among unvaccinated older people or those with existing health problems. That means the outbreak could cause “a serious situation” because North Korea lacks medical equipment and medicine to treat virus patients and many of its people are not well-nourished, Kim Sin-gon said. Ahn Kyung-su, head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG, a website focusing on health issues in North Korea, said North Korea’s admission of the outbreak is likely designed to press its people harder to guard against the virus as China, which shares a long, porous border with the North, has placed many of its cities under lockdown over virus concerns. North Korea will also likely stress lockdowns, although the experience of China’s “zero-COVID” policy suggests that approach doesn’t work against the fast-moving omicron variant, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. “For Pyongyang to publicly admit omicron cases, the public health situation must be serious,” Easley said. “This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul. But the Kim regime’s domestic audience may be less interested in nuclear or missile tests when the urgent threat involves coronavirus rather than a foreign military.” North Korea’s previous coronavirus-free claim had been disputed by many foreign experts. But South Korean officials have said North Korea had likely avoided a huge outbreak, in part because it instituted strict virus controls almost from the start of the pandemic. Early in 2020 — before the coronavirus spread around the world — North Korea took severe steps to keep out the virus and described them as a matter of “national existence.” It all but halted cross-border traffic and trade for two years, and is even believed to have ordered troops to shoot on sight any trespassers who crossed its borders. The extreme border closures further shocked an economy already damaged by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program, pushing Kim to perhaps the toughest moment of his rule since he took power in 2011. North Korea had been one of the last places in the world without an acknowledged COVID-19 case after the virus first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 spread to every continent including Antarctica. Turkmenistan, a similarly secretive and authoritarian nation in Central Asia, has reported no cases to the World Health Organization, though its claim also is widely doubted by outside experts. In recent months, some Pacific island nations that kept the virus out by their geographic isolation have recorded outbreaks. Only tiny Tuvalu, with a population around 12,000, has escaped the virus so far, while a few other nations – Nauru, Micronesia and Marshall Islands – have stopped cases at their borders and avoided community outbreaks. North Korea’s outbreak comes as China — its close ally and trading partner — battles its biggest outbreak of the pandemic. In January, North Korea tentatively reopened railroad freight traffic between its border town of Sinuiju and China’s Dandong for the first time in two years, but China halted the trade last month due to an outbreak in Liaoning province, which borders North Korea. ___ Associated Press journalists Lee Jin-man in Paju, South Korea, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report."

6,U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths Set Another Tragic Record,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — More than 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year, setting another tragic record in the nation’s escalating overdose epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated Wednesday. The provisional 2021 total translates to roughly one U.S. overdose death every 5 minutes. It marked a 15% increase from the previous record, set the year before. The CDC reviews death certificates and then makes an estimate to account for delayed and incomplete reporting. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, called the the latest numbers “truly staggering.” U.S. overdose deaths have risen most years for more than two decades. The increase began in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and — most recently — illicit fentanyl. Last year, overdoses involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids surpassed 71,000, up 23% from the year before. There also was a 23% increase in deaths involving cocaine and a 34% increase in deaths involving meth and other stimulants. Overdose deaths are often attributed to more than one drug. Some people take multiple drugs and inexpensive fentanyl has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, officials say. “The net effect is that we have many more people, including those who use drugs occasionally and even adolescents, exposed to these potent substances that can cause someone to overdose even with a relatively small exposure,” Volkow said in a statement. Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem as lockdowns and other restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get. Overdose death trends are geographically uneven. Alaska saw a 75% increase in 2021 — the largest jump of any state. In Hawaii, overdose deaths fell by 2%. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

7,Gun Homicides Surged To Highest Level In 25 Years During Pandemic,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Gun deaths increased dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic as economic and social conditions worsened throughout the country — and disproportionately impacted low-income Black and Native communities. A report released Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the vast majority of homicides (79%) and most suicides (53%) involved a gun in 2020. The rate of gun-related homicides reached its highest level in 25 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, with firearm homicides going up nearly 35% from 2019 to 2020. As gun-related deaths have increased, so have disparities in these deaths by race and poverty level. The biggest increase in gun homicides was among Black men — 39% higher from 2019 to 2020. And while the firearm suicide rate overall remained largely unchanged year over year, gun suicides rose significantly among Native men — 42% from 2019 to 2020. To reduce gun deaths, the CDC said it was urgent to address the “underlying economic, physical, and social conditions contributing to the risks for violence and suicide.” “Long-standing systemic inequities and structural racism … contribute to unfair and avoidable health disparities among some racial and ethnic groups,” the agency noted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple factors may have contributed to a higher rate of gun deaths in low-income, Black, and Native communities, the CDC said, including disruptions to services and education, mental stress, social isolation, job loss and housing instability. The pandemic has disproportionately ravaged communities of color, with Native people 2.8 times more likely to be infected with the coronavirus than white people and 1.4 times more likely to die of it, according to an August 2020 CDC report; Black people were three times as likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to die as white people. It’s also worth noting that there have been over 1,200 fatal police shootings annually in the past few years ― and Black people are far more likely than whites to be killed by law enforcement.

8,"Shanghai Disinfects Homes, Closes All Subways Under China's 'Zero-COVID' Strategy",coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Teams in white protective suits are entering the homes of coronavirus-infected people to spray disinfectant as Shanghai tries to root out an omicron outbreak under China’s strict “zero-COVID” strategy. City official Jin Chen said Tuesday that in older communities with shared bathrooms and kitchens, the homes of anyone else who uses those facilities will also be disinfected. He tried to address public concern about damage to clothing and valuables, saying residents can inform the teams about anything that needs protection. Shanghai also suspended service on the last two subway lines that were still operating Tuesday, marking the first time the city’s entire system has been shut down, according to The Paper, an online media outlet. The latest measures come as Shanghai has ordered people in some districts to stay in their homes again after letting some out for limited shopping in recent weeks. The latest steps have further frustrated residents, who were hoping a more than monthlong lockdown was finally easing as the number of new cases in the city falls. Most of the city of 25 million people appear confined to their apartments or residential complexes, though there has been some easing in outlying suburban areas without new cases in their communities. AP video shot Monday showed a silent and deserted city, with only a very occasional vehicle and a few food delivery drivers on scooters moving down empty roads. The daily number of new cases in Shanghai fell to about 3,000 on Monday, down from a peak of 26,000 in mid-April. Authorities have kept most of the city bottled up as they try to stop the spread of the virus, even as many other parts of the world are loosening restrictions and trying to live with it. Six more COVID-related deaths were reported in China’s largest city, raising the toll from the outbreak to 553. Beijing, the capital, began another round of three days of mass testing for millions of its residents Tuesday in a bid to prevent an outbreak from growing to Shanghai proportions. The city, which recorded 74 new cases on Monday, has locked down individual buildings and residential compounds, shut about 60 subway stations and banned dining at restaurants, allowing only takeout and delivery. Authorities in Beijing say there's no lockdown in the city, but there's a work-from-home order and restaurants are closed.Asia correspondent Tom Cheshire takes us on a ride through the city to see what life is like in China's 'shadow lockdown'.More: https://t.co/ZEJjoaMnOi pic.twitter.com/ZF3IMjAW7t Shanghai initially ordered mass testing along with a limited lockdown, but extended that as case numbers rose. Thousands of residents have been forced into centralized quarantine centers after testing positive or having been in contact with an infected person. Notices issued in several districts in recent days said residents were ordered to stay home and barred from receiving nonessential deliveries as part of a “quiet period” lasting at least until Wednesday. The measures could be extended depending on the results of mass testing, the notices said. The sudden tightening, after some initial opening up, took residents by surprise. ___ Associated Press researchers Si Chen in Shanghai and Yu Bing in Beijing contributed."

0,4 Common Places BA.2 And Other Omicron Subvariants Are Spreading,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Earlier in the pandemic, contact tracing data showed us where COVID-19 was predominantly spreading. Unfortunately, because our contact tracing efforts have slowed down, we don’t have as clear of a picture regarding where people are mostly likely to contract omicron and its subvariants. What we do know is that, while the virus has evolved to be much more transmissible than previous variants, the way COVID-19 spreads hasn’t changed. “Nothing has changed in terms of how any individual right now, regardless of their day-to-day activity, can pick this virus up,” Mark Cameron, infectious disease researcher at Case Western Reserve University, told HuffPost. Because of that, we can assume there are some hot spots for BA.2 and other omicron subvariants compared to others. Here are common places where COVID-19 still spreads, according to experts: By now, we’ve all heard it a million times. COVID-19 spreads in crowded, indoor settings — think: gyms, restaurants, concerts, bars and the like. Cameron said there’s no shortage of anecdotes about how the virus is spreading at such events. Massive outbreaks have recently been recorded after Phish’s four-night concert run, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and the annual Washington Gridiron Club dinner, as well as on cruises and after high school proms. In crowded, poorly ventilated indoor settings, aerosols containing the virus can spread in the air and easily be inhaled by many. “Similar to other COVID variants, BA.2 spreads more easily in crowded, indoor locations with limited ventilation,” said Bernadette Boden-Albala, director and founding dean of the Program in Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. COVID-19 is also known to spread easily between family members — and roommates — who live together. Research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in February shows that COVID-19 now has a household transmission rate of about 53%. Transmission is even more likely to occur when members of the same household are unvaccinated along with those who don’t wear a mask or isolate. “The ability to transmit from one person to another in close quarters, that will still happen. Nothing has changed in terms of how we can catch this very infectious airborne virus when we are in close proximity to someone else,” Cameron said. Boden-Albala said household spread is especially prominent in apartment living and multi-family homes, which reaffirms that COVID-19 ― and all its strains ― can be a disease of disparities. Since the start of the pandemic, COVID-19 has been shown to rip through senior care facilities. While recent data from the CDC shows that boosters significantly help nursing home residents avoid severe outcomes, nursing homes and other congregate living facilities are still prone to major outbreaks. Seventeen long-term care homes in Winnipeg, Canada, reported outbreaks last week. A women’s prison in Vermont experienced an outbreak in late April, as have a handful of long-term care facilities in the state. “Those are, since the start and still are, the hotbeds of outbreaks,” Cameron said. Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist and demographer who studies infectious diseases at University of California, Irvine, said the main takeaway is that COVID-19 spreads indoors. “Anywhere you’re indoors, that’s where it’s spreading — anywhere and everywhere,” Noymer said. Boden-Albala noted that BA.2 is spreading in places that are the usual suspects: “settings like bars and restaurants where attendees may share food and beverages or wear their masks intermittently — if at all.” Whether you have dinner at a friend’s house, go over to a relative’s for game night, take a taxi, go into an office or go out to eat, if you are indoors, there is a risk you could catch COVID-19. While planes are typically less risky due to their powerful air filtration systems, people can still catch COVID-19 while flying if they are seated near someone who is infected. Despite the fact that masking is no longer required on planes, Noymer continues to recommend wearing an N95 mask on a plane. The risk of being exposed to COVID-19 may be less now than it was in January, when the country experienced a massive surge, but it is still notable since the latest variants are that much more contagious. “These new omicron variants are fit and they’re easily transmittable,” Cameron said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,‘A Strange Loop’ Leads Tony Awards With 11 Nominations,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — “A Strange Loop,” Michael R. Jackson’s critically cheered theater meta-journey earned a leading 11 Tony Award nominations Monday as Broadway joined the national discussion of race by embracing an envelope-pushing Black-written and Black-led musical. Jackson’s 2020 Pulitzer Prize drama winner about a Black gay man writing a show about a Black gay man earned nods for best musical, best leading man in newcomer Jaquel Spivey and best featured actress for L Morgan Lee, who becomes the first openly transgender performer to be nominated for a Tony Award. Jesse Williams, the “Grey’s Anatomy” star making his Broadway debut, got a nomination for “Take Me Out,” as did his co-star Jesse Tyler Ferguson of “Modern Family” fame. Playwright Lynn Nottage has two reasons to smile Monday morning: Her book for the musical “MJ was nominated for best book and her play “Clyde’s” got a nod for best play. Right behind “A Strange Loop” is a tie with 10 nominations each for “MJ,” a bio musical of the King of Pop stuffed with his biggest hits, and “Paradise Square,” a musical about Irish immigrants and Black Americans jostling to survive in New York City around the time of the Civil War. The rest of the best new musical category includes “Six,” the corrective feminist take on the six wives of England’s Henry VIII, “Girl From the North Country,” which uses the songs of Bob Dylan to weave a Depression-era story in the Midwest and “Mr. Saturday Night,” a reworking of Billy Crystal’s film about a bitter, old insult comic chasing a last laugh. Two of the best play nominees are about economics — “Skeleton Crew,” Dominique Morisseau’s play about blue-collar job insecurity in a Detroit auto stamping plant in 2008, and “The Lehman Trilogy,” Stefano Massini’s play spanning 150 years about what led to the collapse of financial giant Lehman Brothers. There’s also “Clyde’s,” Nottage’s play about a group of ex-cons trying to restart their lives at a truck stop diner, and “Hangmen,” Martin McDonagh’s look at an executioner-turned-pub owner forced to grapple with his past when capital punishment is made illegal in the United Kingdom. “The Minutes,” Tracey Letts’ depiction of a small-town city council meeting that exposes backstabbing, greed and the larger delusions in American history, also earned a best play nod. There were four musical revivals during the season, but only three got nominations: “The Music Man” which celebrates America’s soul with a traveling con man in a small Iowa town starring Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, who each have two Tonys and were each nominated this time as well. The two other entries in the musical revival category are “Caroline, Or Change,” Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori’s show that explores America’s racial, social and economic divisions in 1963 Louisiana, and “Company,” Stephen Sondheim’s exploration of a single person’s conflicted feelings about commitment, this time with a gender-switching of the lead character. That left “Funny Girl,” the classic American show starring Beanie Feldstein about the rise of a comic star of the Ziegfeld Follies, out of the running — it got only one nod, for Jared Grimes as best featured actor. Nominations for best play revival are “Trouble in Mind,” Alice Childress’ play about a Broadway play that explores the racial divide in the 1950s, and “How I Learned to Drive,” Vogel’s Pulitzer Prize-winning memory play told by the survivor of childhood sexual abuse, starring two nominees: Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse. The others are “Take Me Out,” Richard Greenberg’s exploration of what happens when a baseball superstar comes out as gay, and “for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enough,” playwright Ntozake Shange’s exploration of Black womanhood. The season — with a whopping 34 new productions — represents a full return to theaters after nearly two years of a pandemic-mandated shutdown. It is also notable for a wave of plays by Black playwrights, reflecting the impact on Broadway of the global conversation about race following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Neither Matthew Broderick nor his wife Sarah Jessica Parker earned nominations for a revival of “Plaza Suite,” but Patti LuPone got one for “Company” and so did LaChanze for “Trouble in Mind.” Ruth Negga earned a nomination for “Macbeth” but her co-star Daniel Craig came up empty. The musical “Mrs. Doubtfire” earned only one nod, for Rob McClure, stepping into the Robin Williams role of an actor who poses as his children’s portly, Scottish nanny in order to spend time with them after a divorce. The nominees for best actress in a musical nominees are Sharon D. Clarke of “Caroline, Or Change,” Foster in “The Music Man,” Katrina Lenk in “Company,” Joaquina Kalukango for “Paradise Square,” Carmen Cusack in “Flying Over Sunset” and Mare Winningham in “Girl From the North Country.” Joining Spivey, Jackman and McClure in the best actor in a musical category are Crystal for “Mr. Saturday Night” and Myles Frost, whose King of Pop in “MJ” was a moonwalking triumph. The eligibility cutoff date for the 2021-2022 season was delayed to May 4 after several Broadway shows had to cancel performances due to COVID-19 cases reported among cast and crew. The Tony Awards will be held at Radio City Music Hall on June 12. The ceremony will air live on CBS and Paramount+ starting at 8 p.m. ET. Film and stage star Ariana DeBose will host. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"

3,"Why This 'Very, Very Contagious' Coronavirus Subvariant Is Causing Cases To Rise Again",coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost After a weeks-long plateau, coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are once again rising in the U.S. as a new, highly transmissible omicron subvariant rapidly makes its way toward becoming the next dominant virus strain. The current seven-day rolling average of cases is back to where it was in February, with an average of 64,000 cases tallied Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s roughly three times what it was toward the end of March. The seven-day average for hospitalizations is also up by 20%, with the CDC reporting an average of 2,215 admissions over the last seven days ― up from the prior week’s average of 1,845. Deaths from COVID-19 have stayed near record lows. This drop in fatalities is likely thanks in part to current dominant variants appearing to be less deadly and vaccination rates being high in the U.S., Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University, told HuffPost. As of this week, roughly 66% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. “The preexisting immunity lets your body handle the infection better, but these variants are so infectious they may not keep you from getting infected,” he said. While the dominant omicron subvariant BA.2, which currently makes up nearly 62% of cases, appears to spread more easily than its predecessor, experts say another subvariant, BA.2.12.1, appears to be even more transmissible. BA.2.12.1 is spreading about 24% faster than BA.2 and, based on current rates, could become the dominant variant within the next few weeks, data shows. This increased transmissibility may be because BA.2.12.1 has not only the omicron BA.2 variant mutation but two more mutations, said Garry. “One of these makes the virus replicate a bit better (S704L). The other (L452Q) makes it resist prior immunity,” he said of these two additional spike protein mutations. “So BA.2.12.1 is more infectious. None of the omicron subvariants seem to induce more severe disease than the original omicron (BA.1). BA.1 seems less severe than delta, but, again, the role of preexisting immunity is hard to factor in,” he added. “We have a very, very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said last week following news of a positive coronavirus test for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is fully vaccinated and twice boosted. Health officials have cautioned that while these current subvariants may be less severe, they could lead to long-term health issues. “I think people sometimes say, well, it’s OK to get infected. No, it’s not, because there are things like long COVID, and there are sometimes people, even though they don’t require hospitalization … they get significantly ill,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC’s “This Week” last month. “That’s not something to pooh-pooh.” Elsewhere in the world, health officials are monitoring the spread of two less common subvariants of omicron: BA.4 and BA.5. South African scientists have said these subvariants, which have been blamed for a recent spike in cases in the country, are capable of dodging antibodies acquired from prior COVID-19 infection, though not the antibodies acquired from vaccination. “It’s too soon to know whether these new subvariants can cause more severe disease than other omicron subvariants, but early data suggest vaccination remains protective against severe disease and death,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said at a press conference Wednesday.

4,"True Pandemic Death Toll More Than Double Official Count, WHO Reveals",coronavirus," LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization is estimating that nearly 15 million people were killed either by the coronavirus or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems in the past two years, more than double the official death toll of 6 million. Most of the fatalities were in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Americas. In a report released on Thursday, the U.N. agency’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the figure as “sobering,” saying it should prompt countries to invest more in their capacities to quell future health emergencies. Scientists tasked by WHO with calculating the actual number of COVID-19 deaths between January 2020 and the end of last year estimated there were between 13.3 million and 16.6 million deaths that were either caused directly by the coronavirus or were somehow attributed to the pandemic’s impact on health systems, like people with cancer unable to seek treatment when hospitals were full of COVID patients. The figures are based on country-reported data and statistical modeling. WHO did not immediately break down the figures to distinguish between direct deaths from COVID-19 and others caused by the pandemic. “This may seem like just a bean-counting exercise, but having these WHO numbers is so critical to understanding how we should combat future pandemics and continue to respond to this one,” said Albert Ko, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Public Health who was not linked to the WHO research. For example, Ko said, South Korea’s decision to invest heavily in public health after it suffered a severe outbreak of MERS allowed it to escape COVID-19 with a per-capita death rate around a 20th of that of the U.S. Accurate numbers on COVID-19 deaths have been problematic throughout the pandemic, as the figures are only a fraction of the devastation wrought by the virus, largely because of limited testing and differences in how countries count COVID-19 deaths. According to government figures reported to WHO and to a separate count kept by Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 6 million  reported coronavirus deaths to date. Scientists at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington guessed there were more than 18 million COVID deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 in a recent study published in the journal Lancet, and a team led by Canadian researchers estimated there were more than 3 million uncounted coronavirus deaths in India alone. Some countries, including India, have disputed WHO’s methodology for calculating COVID deaths, resisting the idea that there were many more deaths than officially counted. Earlier this week, the Indian government released new figures showing there were 474,806 more deaths in 2020 compared to the previous year, but did not say how many were tied to the pandemic. India did not release any death estimates for 2021, when the highly infectious delta variant swept through the country, killing many thousands. Yale’s Ko said better figures from WHO might also explain some lingering mysteries about the pandemic, like why Africa  appears to have been one of the least affected by the virus, despite its low vaccination rates. “Were the mortality rates so low because we couldn’t count the deaths or was there some other factor to explain that?” he said, adding that the crush of deaths in rich countries like Britain and the U.S. proved that resources alone were insufficient to contain a global outbreak. Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a public health specialist at Britain’s University of Exeter, said we may never get close to the true toll of COVID-19, particularly in poor countries. “When you have a massive outbreak where people are dying in the streets because of a lack of oxygen, bodies were abandoned or people had to be cremated quickly because of cultural beliefs, we end up never knowing just how many people died,” he explained. Although Pankhania said the currently estimated COVID-19 death toll still pales in comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic — when experts estimate up to 100 million people died — he said the fact that so many people died despite the advances of modern medicine, including vaccines, is shameful. He also warned the cost of COVID-19 could be far more damaging in the long term, given the increasing burden of long COVID. “With the Spanish flu, there was the flu and then there were some (lung) illnesses people suffered, but that was it,” he said. “There was not an enduring immunological condition that we’re seeing right now with COVID,” he said. “We do not know the extent to which people with long COVID will have their lives cut short and if they will have repeated infections that will cause them even more problems.” Krutika Pathi in New Delhi contributed to this report."
5,Omicron Subvariant BA.2.12.1 Likely To Become Dominant U.S. COVID Strain,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost A coronavirus subvariant called omicron BA.2.12.1, first spotted in upstate New York, is likely to become the dominant strain in the United States in the coming weeks, according to The New York Times, as coronavirus cases again trend upward in the country. While the BA.2 variant continued to drive the majority of infections, making up 61.9% of total cases for the week ending April 30, BA.2.12.1 has been increasing steadily. The subvariant accounted for 36.5% of cases last week, up from 26.6% the week ending April 23, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While cases are rising across the U.S., we are far from the January peak attributed to the original omicron BA.1 variant. Omicron subvariants have been growing “in part because they have become more difficult for our immune system to ‘see,’” Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, wrote in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times published Wednesday. “That means even the millions of people who had omicron BA.1 infections earlier this year are still vulnerable to infection with BA.2.12.1, especially if they’re unvaccinated,” Topol writes. “That will promote spread and prolong the pandemic.” BA.12.2.1 appears to spread even more easily than the earlier highly contagious omicron strains, but vaccines seem to hold up well, preventing severe illness, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters during a press briefing on April 26. “It appears it might have a transmission advantage of about 25% over the BA.2 subvariant,” Walensky said of the new strain. “Additional evaluation is currently underway to understand the impact of BA.2.12.1 on vaccine effectiveness. But importantly, we continue to believe that those who are vaccinated and especially those who are boosted continue to have strong protection against severe disease, even from BA.2.12.1.” Last month, New York state warned New Yorkers of the emergence of BA.2.12.1 and another omicron subvariant and their spread in the community. “While these subvariants are new, the tools to combat them are not,” state Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett said on April 13. Those tools include vaccines and boosters, along with testing and wearing a face mask indoors. A rise in infections pushed New York City into the CDC’s medium COVID risk level on Monday. So far, the city has not imposed new restrictions, but face masks in indoor places could return if the risk level increases further to high, according to NBC New York. Face masks have been the subject of fierce national debate. A Donald Trump-appointed judge voided a federal mask mandate for travel last month, saying the rule exceeded the CDC’s authority. The CDC though issued a statement on Tuesday saying it still recommends that passengers age 2 or older continue to mask up on public transportation, including airplanes. Meanwhile, most major U.S. airlines, including United, Delta and American, have removed their mask requirements. Public transit agencies in New York and Los Angeles continue mandating the use of masks, while systems in Philadelphia and elsewhere have made masks optional. Amtrak also dropped mask requirements. Pfizer said Tuesday it would update U.S. regulators on the effectiveness of its vaccine on young children under 5 years old in late May or early June. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

7,Biden Showcases Deficit Progress In Bid To Counter Critics,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday highlighted new figures showing the government’s red ink will grow less than expected this year and the national debt will shrink this quarter as he tried to counter criticism of his economic leadership amid growing dismay over inflation going into midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Biden, embracing deficit reduction as a way to fight inflation, stressed that the dip in the national debt would be the first in six years, an achievement that eluded former President Donald Trump despite his promises to improve the federal balance sheet. “The bottom line is the deficit went up every year under my predecessor before the pandemic and during the pandemic. It has gone down both years since I’ve been here,” Biden said. “Why is it important? Because bringing down the deficit is one way to ease inflationary pressures.” The president is placing a renewed emphasis on reducing the deficit — which is the gap between what the nation spends and what it takes in — in order to blunt Republican criticism that the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package has left the U.S. economy worse off. It’s an attempt to burnish his credentials as a responsible steward of the economy while trying to fend off criticism about inflation at a 40-year high. The reopening of the economy coming out of the coronavirus pandemic and the commodity squeeze resulting from the  Russia-Ukraine war  has made high prices a key political risk for Democrats. But it is unclear if greater fiscal responsibility can deliver politically for Biden as Democrats try to defend their control of the House and Senate. His two most recent Democratic predecessors, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also cut budget deficits, only to leave office and see their Republican successors use the savings on tax cuts. When reporters tried to question Biden about other topics after his remarks, the president prodded, “You don’t want to ask about deficits?” Bidden is making a nuanced argument about how the financial outlook has improved: Strong job gains over the past 16 months have increased total incomes and led to additional tax revenues. That means that this fiscal year’s budget deficit will decline $1.5 trillion, much better than the $1.3 trillion that was initially forecast. Less government borrowing will, in turn, limit the financial sources of inflation. But the expected $26 billion drop this quarter in the national debt — which is money the U.S. owes due to accumulated deficits over time — will be short-lived, as the debt already totals $23.9 trillion and will continue to rise in the second half of this year. And while Biden expects his plans will improve the outlook for budget deficits over the next decade, the national debt would continue to climb. The Biden administration believes that the cost of servicing the debt is low enough to sustain the borrowing, while critics say structural changes are needed to improve the long-term outlook. “There needs to be a real fiscal restructuring because we continue to see these trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now leads the center-right American Action Forum. Holtz-Eakin said the Biden administration is taking credit for lower deficits over the past two years that largely occurred due to the end of coronavirus-related spending, rather than fixing the finances of Medicare and Social Security that will determine the long-term budget outlook. “That doesn’t seem to be the right aspiration for a great country,” Holtz-Eakin said. “What they’re doing is essentially deferring the need to do anything real and genuinely fix the programs that are important to people.” Deficit reduction also matches a priority of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the key Democratic vote in the evenly split Senate who blocked the passage of Biden’s domestic and environmental agenda in December. The reduction also occurs amid rising interest rates on U.S. Treasury notes, a consequence of inflation running at 8.5% and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reduce price pressures. Within an hour of Biden’s remarks, Senate Republicans gathered to challenge Biden’s economic policies. Their core critique is that overspending in response to COVID-19 was paired with restrictions on domestic oil and natural gas production, leading to higher gasoline prices than under Trump. ’The biggest drag on the U.S. economy right now involves the rising energy costs,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska. “This is purely a self-inflicted wound by the Biden administration.” One of the challenges for Biden is that voters have largely shrugged off deficit increases and seldom rewarded deficit cuts. Voters might discuss the idea of reducing deficits with pollsters, yet health care, incomes and inflation are often top of mind when casting their ballots. Norman Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted that deficits are often “abstract” for voters. The recent low interest rates have also muted any potential economic drags from higher deficits, which have risen following the COVID-19 pandemic and, separately, the 2008 financial crisis, to help the economy recover. “They’re more likely to respond to things that are in their wheelhouse or that they believe will have a more direct effect on their lives,” Ornstein said. Deficits are “a step removed for most voters, and we’ve been through periods where we’ve had the big deficits and debt and it’s not like it devastated directly people’s lives.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Still Wearing A Mask? Here's What To Do If Someone Confronts You About It.,coronavirus," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Caren Gussoff Sumption, a writer who lives in the Seattle area, estimates about half of the people in her neighborhood are still wearing masks. That group includes Gussoff Sumption and her husband. They both have chronic health conditions and take immunosuppressant medications, so they’re in no rush to remove their face coverings. Not everyone is understanding. About a month ago, Gussoff Sumption was filling up her gas tank in South Seattle when a man on the opposite side of the pump shouted something at her. “I didn’t catch what he was saying at first, but then when I realized he was talking to me, I listened,” the writer told HuffPost. As he gestured at her face, eventually Gussoff Sumption made out his words: “Mask mandate is over. You can breathe free!” “I just shook my head and kept pumping my gas but he kept talking, and all I caught were snatches, to be honest,” she said. “But it was obvious he was trying to explain to me, like I was a child ― I’m 49 ― that omicron was not as contagious and I didn’t have to live my life in fear.” He wasn’t necessarily being nasty about the mask, but the comments were unsolicited and Gussoff Sumption felt infantilized and more than a little annoyed because of it. She said she’s not generally quick on her toes with comebacks or responses, but this time was different. “I raised my palm, and announced, ‘Unsubscribe,’” Gussoff Sumption said. “It just fell out. He then, finally, backed off, and said something like, ‘Fair enough.’” It was a well-played use of internet slang ― and, increasingly, an uncomfortably relatable experience on the whole. As we enter the “mask optional” phase of the pandemic, comments like “you know you don’t have to wear that in here” are more and more common. Masks have been a political hot topic throughout the country since the start of the pandemic — leading to vocal opposition and sometimes even physical confrontation. As mask mandates have lifted throughout the United States in the past few months, many people who continue to wear a facial covering are concerned their choice may lead to a confrontation ― “mask harassment” as it’s been dubbed. In March, for example, a video showing Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis telling students at a high school to remove their masks and stop the “COVID theater” went viral. Encounters like these are snide, though often civil enough, but some people have been downright hostile over others wearing masks. In April, novelist Elaine Hsieh Chou tweeted about a troubling experience she had one night in her neighborhood in New York City. “Walking home just now, three men yelled, ‘Coronavirus is over’ at me because I was wearing a mask and then proceeded to make ‘Chinese sounds,’” Hsieh Chou wrote. (Throughout the pandemic, Asian Americans have dealt with aggressive harassment and even physical assault regardless of whether they were wearing a mask because of the coronavirus’s likely origins in Wuhan, China.) “What hurts even more is, as I turned around to stare at them, they were laughing while they walked away,” Hsieh Chou wrote in the Twitter thread. “They looked like they were going out for the night. They are probably having a great time as we speak. They have certainly forgotten me.” Meanwhile, she wrote, “I am crying, triggered by all the other times people have shouted at me in public for no reason, when I was minding my own business and just EXISTING.” Walking home just now, three men yelled “Coronavirus is over” at me because I was wearing a mask and then proceeded to make “Chinese sounds.” Why do so many people feel compelled to call out mask usage? During the pandemic, mask-wearing was the norm and the expectation. Now that we’re tentatively entering the endemic phase of the virus, face coverings are mostly optional, which only makes them more of a loaded topic, said Monica Gandhi, a doctor and professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. “That’s because the face mask has been the most visible sign of the pandemic,” she said. If you’ve long accepted that and are eager to move on to the endemic phase of this virus, a mask is an unsettling visual reminder that we may not be out of the woods yet. “That’s when you get people feeling compelled to comment or feeling affronted by others wearing masks,” Gandhi said. “The reality is, we should all be respectful of each other’s risk tolerance and choices.” If you’re concerned about dealing with unpleasant remarks about your mask-wearing (or worse), experts in public health and de-escalation techniques offer their best advice below for getting through the next few months. First, let’s state the obvious: You’re not obligated to explain yourself. If you don’t want to talk about your reasons for wearing a mask, it’s fine to say so, said Meg Stone, the executive director of IMPACT Boston, a violence prevention and empowerment self-defense program. “Using a direct, assertive, respectful tone will give you the best chance of getting your point across without escalating the situation,” she said. “Keep it simple, say something like, ‘I don’t really feel like talking about masks’ and then end the conversation. Then physically move away if you can.” Some people are still wearing a mask because they’re immunocompromised and are at greater risk of COVID-19, even after vaccination. Some are protecting someone older or immunocompromised in their household or inner circle. Others just don’t want to deal with getting sick. If someone brings up your mask and you’d like to respond, any one of those reasons above should be met with respect, said Edward A. Nardell, a professor in the departments of environmental health and immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Medical School. “Or just tell the person, ‘My assessment is that I am safer and my loved ones are safer if I wear a mask in this setting. Your assessment may be different for you,’” he explained. There’s nothing wrong with mentally preparing for how you might respond in the event that someone says something about your mask. In fact, practice is probably a good thing if your social skills are a little rusty since the pandemic. “We all are tempted to react and stand our ground, but it can be a futile exercise leading to untoward outcomes,” said Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of public health at New Mexico State University. Your “script” doesn’t have to be too complicated; a simple “thanks, but I feel more comfortable this way” works fine here, said Ashley Virtue, the external relations director at the National Conflict Resolution Center. “In our workshops, we always talk about how, when it comes to communication, we need to train our brain to respond calmly whenever we are confronted. Otherwise we will naturally fall into ‘fight, flight or freeze,’” Virtue added. Practicing out loud what you might say if someone comes up to you is an incredibly useful way to train your brain so you’re not unnerved by such an encounter, Virtue said. If someone becomes threatening or the conversation is getting tense, prioritize your safety and walk away, Stone said. “In a strong, firm voice, you can say, ‘please leave me alone’ or ‘don’t get closer to me,’ phrases that are direct and assertive but also about yourself and your safety rather than insulting the other person,” she said. If you see someone being harassed, Vox has a great guide on how to help de-escalate the situation as a bystander. If it’s safe to do so, one of the easiest ways to help is to document what’s happening with your phone, whether it’s through audio or video. Or you could pretend to be friends with the person being harassed and pull them away from the situation by saying, “Hey, there you are! We’re late for our dinner reservations ― we better get going.” If you’d like to feel more empowered personally, Stone recommends this guide from Defend Yourself in Washington, D.C., on how to choose a self-defense class that best suits you. “It’s an empowering guide, not victim-blaming, and it will help you learn verbal skills, not just kicking and punching,” she said. Dealing with comments about your mask can be especially tricky at work. Try to keep the conversation short; make it about yourself and your personal preference rather than turning it into a polemic on public health and responsibility, clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula told HuffPost in March. Whatever your reasoning, Durvasula advised against engaging too much with a co-worker: “Don’t take the bait.” As a psychologist, Valentina Stoycheva often discusses with people the difference between “I have to” and “I get to.” “Get comfortable saying, ‘I don’t have to wear a mask, but I get to do so to keep others safe,’” she said. “It may fly over the head of some people, but for those who get it, it may help shift their thinking, even if it’s just a little bit.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"

He even jokingly explained how he got it: Our daughter brought us covid (even though we specifically asked her not to) All feeling fine, I am double vaxxed and boosted but the show must not go on. Apologies to @TomCruise & @iliza and thanks to Mike Birbiglia @birbigs who'll be filling in for me starting tomorrow night Kimmel canceled Monday night’s show and lined up comic Mike Birbiglia to fill in as host until he recovers. “I must be the first person to ever deplane a Southwest Airlines flight and find out they’re guest-hosting a late night talk show,” Birbiglia wrote on Twitter. Kimmel is the second late-night host to develop the infection in recent weeks. “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert returned to the air on Monday after his own battle with COVID-19. “This is a broadcast emergency,” Colbert said of Kimmel’s illness during his Monday night monologue. “TV is down a Jimmy!” Colbert also called for presidential help: Wishing our dear friend @jimmykimmel a speedy recovery.

1,Oprah Didn't Leave Home For 322 Days And Did 'Not Really' Miss Other People,coronavirus," Assignment editor, HuffPost While many people struggled with social distancing during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oprah Winfrey was not one of them. “I’ve been so careful with myself that my own friends make fun of me,” the talk show legend told the Los Angeles Times in a lengthy interview published Friday. “I didn’t leave home for 322 days — literally did not leave the house.” But the near-year spent at her sprawling California estate ― nicknamed “The Promised Land” ― was no hardship. “What has surprised me the most is how well I was able to adjust to the isolation and not being around other people,” Winfrey said. “I remember one point [Gayle King] said, ‘Don’t you just miss being around other people?’ I go, ‘Eh, not really.’” She believes part of the reason she adjusted so well is that it balanced out the years of intense social interaction her long career has brought her. “I was in an audience of 350 people twice a day, so I’ve had shaking hands and autographs and selfies, and lots of attention, and exposure to being around a lot of people,” she said. But when she started staying home, she was “able to be with myself in a way that I haven’t been able to for years, because usually, even if I take time off for myself, I’m thinking about what is the next thing to come.” Winfrey, a billionaire, acknowledged that she has a “very blessed and privileged life,” and that a huge part of why she was able to embrace isolation is that she didn’t have to worry about where her “next paycheck” was coming from. She also wasn’t totally alone for all 322 days. For one thing, she had longtime partner Stedman Graham, though he did famously quarantine in the guesthouse for two weeks at the beginning of the pandemic. She was also visited by close friend Gayle King ― along with King’s team at CBS “This Morning” ― whom she also put on strict quarantine protocol. Winfrey was talking to the Times to promote “The Color of Care,” a new documentary she executive-produced about the COVID-19 pandemic and racial disparities in the health care system. She was inspired to make the documentary after reading about Gary Fowler, a Black man who died of COVID in the spring of 2020 after multiple hospitals refused to help him. She was “haunted” by the story and a photograph of Fowler, she told the Detroit Free Press, which was the first news outlet to cover the story. “I want people to be aware that because of the color of your skin, there are disparities in your ability to receive your rightful health care,” she said.

3,Should You Use Paxlovid If You Have Asymptomatic COVID?,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Paxlovid ― the antiviral drug that has been found to decrease the risk of COVID hospitalization and death by 89% ― has been touted for those most at-risk, such as older people and those with comorbidities. However, there’s confusion about who can access the pills and how much benefit they may have. Vice President Kamala Harris was prescribed Paxlovid earlier this week despite being asymptomatic, which raises the question of whether people with asymptomatic or mild COVID should be taking the drug. This is where it gets complicated, as everybody who gets COVID is asymptomatic initially. Some people stay asymptomatic, while others get mild symptoms and some go on to develop severe disease. But Paxlovid is only effective if you start taking it within the first five days of illness. “You can imagine a world where there’s many people who may be in a pre-symptomatic phase of the illness, where they consider themselves asymptomatic but they just haven’t started getting symptoms yet, but are still within that five-day window and we have to make a decision about whether or not to treat them,” said Arjun Venkatesh, an emergency medicine doctor at Yale Medicine and associate term professor at Yale School of Medicine. The drug is currently recommended for high-risk patients, because it can make the biggest difference in them, said Thomas Lew, a hospitalist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford Health Care. When started within the first few days of illness, Paxlovid can block the coronavirus from replicating itself inside your body. For those who are most at risk — including people who have cancer or kidney or lung disease, who are obese or who have received an organ transplant — this could be lifesaving. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the drug is useless in people who aren’t high-risk or who only have mild cases. Paxlovid may still lessen those symptoms, Lew said, which in turn would mean decreasing pressure on the health care system. We also don’t yet know if Paxlovid could help protect people from long COVID, regardless of whether they had symptoms. Unfortunately, we don’t have a way to predict exactly how the disease will play out in each person. Most doctors make the call based on a person’s risk factors and the number of days it’s been since they’ve tested positive. It’s less about whether they’re symptomatic at that point in time because it’s challenging to determine whether someone will stay completely asymptomatic or go on to develop some more moderate-to-severe symptoms in a few days. And Paxlovid came under the spotlight this week because some people are experiencing a resurgence of symptoms ― and positive test results after being negative ― once finishing the five-day course of the pills. Doctors are looking into why this may occur, and it’s not clear whether the severity of symptoms (or lack thereof) may play a role. Until now, it has been nearly impossible for many ― even people who were at-risk — to get a prescription for the antiviral. That appears to be shifting, and President Joe Biden announced this week that there’s “ample supply” of the medication. “We were very restrictive around who we used them in because we wanted to use them in people with the absolute highest risk of severe disease,” Venkatesh said. This meant that there were many people, even those moderately at risk for severe disease, who weren’t given treatment due to supply issues. But we’re heading to a different place now. Over 630,000 packs of Paxlovid are currently available. Many doctors are still prescribing these treatments with a scarcity mindset, Venkatesh said, when they need to adopt a more regular-treatment mindset. The recommendations can be readjusted if supply falls short again, he added. “We should be in a spot — both nationally and in any given state — where anyone who meets criteria can get treated, but we have to rebalance our thinking on it,” Venkatesh said. There is currently no definitive guidance on whether asymptomatic people should take Paxlovid. Some physicians believe all at-risk individuals with asymptomatic COVID should start Paxlovid immediately to prevent the disease from becoming severe. Others argue that Paxlovid only makes an impact in people who are already symptomatic. Doctors do generally agree that many people will be OK without the drug. “Young, healthy, vaccinated and otherwise low-risk individuals who are not symptomatic likely do not need Paxlovid,” Lew said. Whatever you decide, you’ll want to make that decision fast because Paxlovid works best when taken as close to the start of the infection as possible. Based on data from the clinical trials on Paxlovid and antiviral drugs used for other infectious diseases like influenza, it’s widely believed that antivirals get less effective the longer people wait to start taking them, according to Venkatesh. If you’re confused about whether you should take Paxlovid, talk to your doctor or consult a local urgent care facility (which can be done virtually). Keep in mind that Paxlovid does interact with a handful of other medications ― including statins, protease inhibitors, certain immunosuppressants and antipsychotics ― that are typically taken for the exact conditions that put people at risk for COVID in the first place. For those who are at risk but can’t take Paxlovid due to other medications, alternative treatments are out there. And remember: Paxlovid is not 100% effective — some people will take the full five-day course, feel better, then test positive again and require a different treatment. “Recommendations can be very different depending on your age, medical conditions, what other medications you are taking, and if you know where and when you were exposed,” Lew said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

5,Climate Change May Increase Risk Of New Infectious Diseases,coronavirus," Climate change will result in thousands of new viruses spread among animal species by 2070 — and that’s likely to increase the risk of emerging infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans, according to a new study. This is especially true for Africa and Asia, continents that have been hotspots for deadly disease spread from humans to animals or vice versa over the last several decades, including the flu, HIV, Ebola and coronavirus. Researchers, who published their findings Thursday in the journal Nature, used a model to examine how over 3,000 mammal species might migrate and share viruses over the next 50 years if the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which recent research shows is possible. They found that cross-species virus spread will happen over 4,000 times among mammals alone. Birds and marine animals weren’t included in the study. Researchers said not all viruses will spread to humans or become pandemics the scale of the coronavirus but the number of cross-species viruses increases the risk of spread to humans. The study highlights two global crises — climate change and infectious disease spread — as the world grapples with what to do about both. Previous research has looked at how deforestation and extinction and wildlife trade lead to animal-human disease spread, but there’s less research about how climate change could influence this type of disease transmission, the researchers said at a media briefing Wednesday. “We don’t talk about climate a lot in the context of zoonoses” — diseases that can spread from animals to people, said study co-author Colin Carlson, an assistant professor of biology at Georgetown University. “Our study ... brings together the two most pressing global crises we have.” Experts on climate change and infectious disease agreed that a warming planet will likely lead to increased risk for the emergence of new viruses. Daniel R. Brooks, a biologist at University of Nebraska State Museum and co-author of the book “The Stockholm Paradigm: Climate Change and Emerging Disease,” said the study acknowledges the threat posed by climate change in terms of increasing risk of infectious diseases. “This particular contribution is an extremely conservative estimate for potential” emerging infectious disease spread caused by climate change, said Brooks. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and interim director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the study confirms long-held suspicions about the impact of warming on infectious disease emergence. “Of particular note is that the study indicates that these encounters may already be happening with greater frequency and in places near where many people live,” Bernstein said. Study co-author Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University, said that because climate-driven infectious disease emergence is likely already happening, the world should be doing more to learn about and prepare for it. “It is not preventable, even in the best case climate change scenarios,” Albery said. Carlson, who was also an author on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said we must cut greenhouse gas and phase out fossil fuels to reduce the risk of infectious disease spread. Jaron Browne, organizing director of the climate justice group Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, said the study highlights climate injustices experienced by people living in African and Asian nations. “African and Asian nations face the greatest threat of increased virus exposure, once again illustrating how those on the frontlines of the crisis have very often done the least to create climate change,” Browne said."
6,Moderna Seeks To Be 1st With COVID Shots For Littlest Kids,coronavirus," Moderna on Thursday asked U.S. regulators to authorize low doses of its COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 6, a long-awaited move toward potentially opening shots for millions of tots by summer. Frustrated families are waiting impatiently for a chance to protect the nation’s littlest kids as all around them people shed masks and other public health precautions ― even though highly contagious coronavirus mutants continue to spread. Moderna submitted data to the Food and Drug Administration that it hopes will prove two low-dose shots can protect babies, toddlers and preschoolers ― albeit not as effectively during the omicron surge as earlier in the pandemic. “There is an important unmet medical need here with these youngest kids,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press. Two kid-size shots “will safely protect them. I think it is likely that over time they will need additional doses. But we’re working on that.” Now, only children ages 5 or older can be vaccinated in the U.S., using rival Pfizer’s vaccine, leaving 18 million younger tots unprotected. Moderna’s vaccine isn’t the only one in the race. Pfizer is soon expected to announce if three of its even smaller-dose shots work for the littlest kids, months after the disappointing discovery that two doses weren’t quite strong enough. Whether it’s one company’s shots or both, FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency will “move quickly without sacrificing our standards” in deciding if tot-sized doses are safe and effective. While questions are swirling about what’s taking so long, Marks pointedly told lawmakers this week that the FDA can’t evaluate a product until a manufacturer completes its application. FDA will publicly debate the evidence with its scientific advisers before making a decision, and Marks said multiple meetings would be set to cover several expected applications. “It’s critically important that we have the proper evaluation so that parents will have trust in any vaccines that we authorize,” Marks told a Senate committee. If FDA clears vaccinations for the littlest, next the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would have to recommend who needs them ― all tots or just those at higher risk from COVID-19. Many parents are desperate for whichever vaccine gets to the scientific finish line first. “We’ve been kind of left behind as everybody else moves on,” said Meagan Dunphy-Daly, a Duke University marine biologist whose 6-year-old daughter is vaccinated ― but whose 3-year-old and 18-month-old sons are part of Pfizer’s trial. The family continues to mask and take other precautions until it’s clear if the boys got real vaccine or dummy shots. If it turns out they weren’t protected in the Pfizer study and Moderna’s shots are cleared first, Dunphy-Daly said she’d seek them for her sons. “I will feel such a sense of relief when I know my boys are vaccinated and that the risk of them getting a serious infection is so low,” she said. Some parents even have urged the government to let families choose shots before all the evidence is in. “This strain of COVID feels almost impossible to dodge,” Dana Walker, a mother of an 8-month-old, tearfully told a CDC meeting last week. “Cut red tape and allow parents to protect their kids.” The FDA will face some complex questions. In a study of kids ages 6 months through 5 years, two Moderna shots — each a quarter of the regular dose — triggered high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, the same amount proven to protect young adults, Burton said. There were no serious side effects, and the shots triggered fewer fevers than other routine vaccinations. But the vaccine proved between about 40% and 50% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 during the trial. Burton blamed the omicron variant’s ability to partially evade vaccine immunity, noting that unboosted adults showed similarly less effectiveness against milder omicron infections. While no children became severely ill during the study, he said high antibody levels are a proxy for protection against more serious illness — and the company will test a child booster dose. Another issue: So far in the U.S., Moderna’s vaccine is restricted to adults. Other countries have expanded the shot to kids as young as 6. But months ago the FDA cited concern about a rare side effect, heart inflammation, in teen boys, and it hasn’t ruled on Moderna’s earlier pediatric applications. Burton said the FDA may consider its vaccine for children of all ages — but also might open it first to the youngest kids who have no other option. He said safety data from millions of older children given Moderna vaccinations abroad should help reassure parents. While COVID-19 generally isn’t as dangerous in youngsters as adults, some do become severely ill or even die. About 475 children younger than 5 have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic’s start, according to the CDC, and child hospitalizations soared at omicron’s peak. Yet it’s not clear how many parents intend to vaccinate the youngest kids. Less than a third of children ages 5 to 11 have had two vaccinations, and 58% of those ages 12 to 17. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

7,4 Questions To Ask Yourself If You're Planning An Event Right Now,coronavirus," Guest Writer For two years, the pandemic has disrupted the event industry. Numerous weddings, bat and bar mitzvahs, milestone birthdays, conferences and large social gatherings worldwide were canceled or postponed. My own wedding in London was rescheduled six months from our original date. Then, at the cusp of the omicron wave in December 2021, my now-husband and I considered canceling altogether. It feels like we’re at a crossroads: Many social gatherings are resuming ― perhaps even booming more than before. We’re in a stage where more people are continuing with events despite COVID risks. So how do we properly navigate this? How can you be responsible with a large gathering? Below, infectious disease and event experts weigh in on what to consider when thinking about a big event. Here’s what you should ask yourself as you plan: While many people have generally moved on from the pandemic, COVID is still circulating, said Brian Labus, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Public Health. As a result, any large event still has the potential to spread disease. There also is no way to predict what will happen in the near (or long) future with the circulation of new and upcoming variants. “There is an additional challenge in planning events that will not take place for at least several months, as we do not know what will be happening at that time,” Labus said. “There could be a large surge in cases that places the guest at higher risk, and that surge could lead to local restrictions on gathering sizes or behaviors such as mask requirements. Things could also remain as they are now.” For anyone planning a large event, it’s important to recognize that there still may not be complete certainty around COVID when the event rolls around and it’s important to be flexible should your original plans need to be adjusted. Melissa Fancy, a wedding planner in Park City, Utah, stresses doing your own personal risk assessment before going through with an event. “If you’re having a party at this point, assuming risk will always be a part of the story,” she said. “I just tell my clients, if you’re not OK with the risk, then it would be better to hold off.” The same applies to guests. Labus said that there’s reasonable anxiety around many factors associated with an event, like traveling on a plane, staying at a hotel or interacting with strangers. Everyone’s risk tolerance is different; what you’re willing to navigate might be different from certain guests’ comfort and it’s important to be respectful and understanding. Anyone planning or attending an event should consider what would potentially happen if they got sick (a “mild” infection may not actually be mild, for example), their health risk factors and just generally what they’re willing to tolerate for the event. The risk of those who are in your household who may be in contact with you should also be considered. Leah Weinberg, a former attorney and owner and creative director of Color Pop Events, advises couples planning an event to consider ways they can safely host and what precautions they are willing to enact or even pay for themselves. Checking local transmission rates before you commit is one way to help in this regard. Additionally, “consider steps like on-site testing, requiring guests to be fully vaccinated, and hosting outdoor events,” Weinberg said. “You can also make sure the space is well-ventilated if indoors. Couples also need to take their guests into consideration to assess whether there are guests on their list who are high-risk.” Your contract is also a huge point of consideration. If restrictions or illness alter your event when the day comes, it may be difficult to get out of it if you don’t build that in from the beginning, explained Jacquelyn Aleece, a corporate event and wedding planner in New Jersey and California. “The biggest financial risk is signing binding contracts with venues or vendors that don’t allow for alternative plans to be made should there be a government shutdown that pauses events, mandates limited guest count or in the event staff or vendors become ill and can’t fulfill their duties,” Aleece said. Anyone planning an event should have a plan B or C prepared given the fluidity of the pandemic — and make sure their venue is on board with that, too, before signing up. It’s tough to figure out how best to host an event. Weigh out what your priorities are and balance them against any hesitations or concerns you or guests may have and make a decision that feels right. Guest Writer"
8,"Bad Jokes, Breasts And Faulty Hitler Comparisons: Here's How Elon Musk Used Twitter",coronavirus," PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Three days before Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter, the world’s richest man tweeted a photo of Bill Gates and used a crude term to make fun of his belly. Playful, aggressive and often juvenile, Musk’s past tweets show how he has used social media to craft his public image as a brash billionaire unafraid to offend. They may also reveal clues as to how Musk will govern the platform he hopes to own. “Look at the feed: It’s all over the place. It’s erratic. At times it’s pretty extreme,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media and who recently assigned Musk’s tweets as reading material for their students. “It paints him as some sort of rebel leader who will take control of the public square to save it. That is a myth he has constructed.” Musk joined Twitter in 2010 and now has more than 85 million followers — the seventh most of any account and the highest for any business leader. He had mused about buying the site before he agreed on Monday to pay $44 billion for Twitter, which he said he hopes to turn into a haven where all speech is allowed. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet. As the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk uses his Twitter account to make business announcements and promote his enterprises. He muses about technology and trade, but has also posted jokes about women’s breasts and once compared Canada’s prime minister to Hitler. He regularly weighs in on global events, as he did in March 2020 when he tweeted that “The coronavirus pandemic is dumb.” On Tuesday Musk used Twitter to criticize one of the platform’s top executives and an attorney, in one case in a reply to a far-right activist who promoted the discredited conspiracy theory that pizza parlors around the U.S. were being used to traffic children. Musk’s tweets were followed by a wave of harassment by other accounts that targeted both individuals. For Vijaya Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who heads up the company’s legal, policy and trust divisions, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. Musk has long used the megaphone of his Twitter account to punch back at critics or people he opposes, such as when he attacked a diver working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand by calling him a “pedo,” short for pedophile. The diver had previously mocked Musk’s proposal to use a sub to rescue the boys. Musk, who won a defamation suit filed by the diver, later said he never intended “pedo” to be interpreted as “pedophile.” A few years ago, after software engineer Cher Scarlett criticized Musk’s handling of the cave incident, the tech billionaire fired back and she was soon being harassed by dozens of Musk’s online fans. He later deleted the posts, but not before Scarlett had to lock down her account because she was receiving so many hateful messages. “It’s ironic to me that somebody who claims they want to buy Twitter to protect free speech has such thin skin,” she said. “He’s a very smart man, and when he replies to people that criticize him, he knows what he’s doing. To me that’s not championing free speech, it’s weaponizing free speech, and I think that’s what he’ll do owning this platform.” Nineteen-year-old Jack Sweeney got Musk’s attention when he created an automated Twitter account that tracked the movements of Musk’s jet. Musk responded by offering Sweeney $5,000 to pull the account. When Sweeney refused, Musk blocked him on Twitter. Sweeney said he’s worried he may get kicked off the site entirely if Musk’s takeover is approved. But he said he likes Musk’s free speech absolutism, and hopes he sees it through. “He’ll make it more open, and I think that’s a good thing,” Sweeney said. Musk’s use of Twitter has also led to problems for his own companies. In one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition. Last year another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, ordered Musk to delete a tweet that officials said illegally threatened to cut stock options for Tesla employees who joined the United Auto Workers union. Those tweets helped cement Musk’s reputation as a brash outsider, a workingman’s billionaire, Grygiel said. But that doesn’t mean he is equipped to run a social media platform with more than 200 million users, the professor added. “Maybe he wants to burn it down,” Grygiel said. “I don’t know. But I do know that it shows that no one person should have this kind of power.”"

0,"Fauci Clarifies Pandemic Not Over, After Saying U.S. 'Out Of Pandemic Phase'",coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday that the pandemic is not over after earlier saying the U.S. was “out of the pandemic phase” of COVID-19 due to the nation’s low level of deaths, hospitalizations and cases being reported. Speaking to NPR on Wednesday, Fauci said: “I want to clarify one thing. I probably should have said the acute component of the pandemic phase. And I understand how that can lead to some misinterpretation.” And in remarks to The Washington Post on Wednesday, Fauci described the nation as being in a “transitional phase, from a deceleration of the numbers into hopefully a more controlled phase and endemicity.” In his initial remarks, the nation’s top infectious disease expert told “PBS NewsHour” that while globally there was “no doubt that this pandemic is still ongoing,” in the U.S., “we are at a low level right now,” referring to the nation’s status as COVID-19 cases continue a weeks-long plateau, with fewer than 60,000 new cases being reported a day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s down from the U.S. reporting more than 1 million new infections in a single day back in January. JUST IN: Dr. Anthony Fauci tells our @JudyWoodruff the U.S. is ""out of the pandemic phase."" https://t.co/x2wbLMyl6O pic.twitter.com/xA71jE4Fuv “We don’t have 900,000 new infections a day and tens and tens and tens of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now, so if you’re saying are we are out of the pandemic phase in this country, we are,” Fauci said Tuesday. He cautioned that “we’re not going to eradicate this virus,” meaning that intermittent vaccinations, annually or longer, will be needed to ensure cases don’t rise again. While cases have generally dropped and plateaued in the U.S. ― where vaccinations have been made widely available ― globally, cases continue to hit pandemic proportions, he said. “Pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world infection that spreads rapidly among people, so if you look at the global situation, there’s no doubt that this pandemic is still ongoing,” Fauci said. Globally, nearly 26 million cases have been reported over the last 28 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy, Australia, Japan and Vietnam have had the highest number of cases during that roughly four-week period, with the U.S. following behind along with the United Kingdom. Medical experts, including Fauci, have noted that case counts in the U.S. are likely much lower than they actually are. Reasons for this include home testing and some of those infected not receiving medical attention because they have few symptoms, if any, from the virus. More than half of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. today are from the omicron virus variant known as BA.2. Evidence suggests that while this variant is more transmissible than the original coronavirus variant, it may cause less severe disease than the delta variant. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
1,The Pandemic Warped Our Sense Of Time. Here's How To Gain It Back.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost At this point of the pandemic, it still feels like we’re stuck in a bit of a time warp. Yes, offices are opening back up and many people are carrying on with their events and travel plans. But there’s still a layer of uncertainty about what might happen next with COVID and when the pandemic will truly end — especially as more variants pop up. Life doesn’t exactly feel normal yet, and as a result, time drags by. Here’s why, and how you can “gain” some of it back: According to Ruth Ogden, an experimental psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University who studies how humans process time, this sensation that time is warped has been a global phenomenon. Through her research, she’s found that people across the globe have experienced distorted time during the pandemic. The biggest culprit of the time warp: the loss of our routines. “All the things in our day that helped us know what time it was ― they were gone. That meant it became easy for time to slip and slide around,” Ogden said. During the pandemic, time stood still for many of us. We canceled our activities and we distanced from friends. People did everything — sleep, eat, work, socialize, parent, exercise — from their homes. “We’re all heavily routinized creatures, but this routine is important because it keeps us in time,” Ogden said. Our day-to-day activities help us perceive time — if we are commuting, we know it’s morning, if we’re running out for lunch, it’s midday, and so on and so forth. Without daily routines, which act as markers of time, it becomes easy to get lost in time. The things that made your Saturday a Saturday, or your Tuesday a Tuesday, may no longer be there. Research also suggests that emotions significantly impact our perception of time. When we’re happy and physiologically aroused, time feels like it’s flying by; conversely, depression can make time feel sluggish. Furthermore, our expectations of how things will occur (i.e., the pandemic is over!) versus the reality of how things play out (there’s a new variant coming for us) can make time feel faster or slower, depending on if the actual outcome was better or worse than our predictions. Think back to the beginning of the pandemic, when news of COVID spreading around China first leaked. How long ago does that feel to you? Months? Years? It’s probably hard to tell. Ogden and her research team have been studying how people feel about the length of the pandemic and have discovered that the brain processes length of time through memories. “If we’ve got loads of memories, then it says, ‘Oh, it must have been a long time,’ but if it has very few memories, then we think it must have been a short period of time,” Ogden said. In theory, most of us should remember the pandemic as being short — because we didn’t do a lot, Ogden said. But she’s found the opposite: most people feel like we’ve been stuck in the pandemic for much longer than we have been. The reason, it seems, is that while we didn’t necessarily form a ton of fun, new memories for a period of time, we still formed memories. We learned how to bake bread, we got into puzzles and crafts and packed our days with Zoom meetings. We navigated life through restrictions, masking and distancing; we developed new skills and fell into new routines. Time moved forward. Just how distorted time feels varies from person to person. It ultimately depends each person’s personal experience with COVID and how much the pandemic has influenced or changed their daily activities, said Nicole Dudukovic, the director of the neuroscience major at the University of Oregon. Ogden’s research, for example, has found that social satisfaction is one of the biggest factors behind how people process time. “The more socially satisfied you were, the ‘quicker’ the pandemic went,” Ogden said, noting that this didn’t just involve being around people, like family in your household, but seeking out and enjoying social connections. People who have engaged in “normal life” again, and are traveling and commuting to the office and engaged in activities, are probably going to have a more normal sense of time right now. People who are at-risk and are hunkering down, along with those who are stressed about returning to pre-pandemic activities, may continue to feel disoriented about time. “For some people, this experience will continue for a long time and that will continue to cause distortion to their experience of time,” Ogden said. Ultimately, the pandemic has made people much more aware of time. We’ve had more time on our hands, which has caused us to become hyper aware of time and how it’s passing, Ogden said. At the same time, we often don’t remember time accurately. It’s very hard for people to remember how we felt about things, like time, in the past — it’s largely influenced by how we feel about things now. Memories of how time once passed can be very inaccurate, according to Dudukovic. While it may feel like time is passing differently now, it’s totally plausible that we’re just misremembering how time felt pre-pandemic. “It’s possible that if you’d asked me in 2019 about how fast time was going that maybe it would be not that different from how I’m feeling about it now,” Dudukovic said. Ogden said it’s important to recognize that we are not going to return to life before the pandemic. “So much in the world has changed as a result of the pandemic,” she said. We’ve carried on and adapted to new ways of work and socializing. One of the best ways to mitigate the feeling that we’re stuck in a time warp is to create new routines. “There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that your routine, and also the number of activities that you’re engaged in, that that’s going to influence how you’re perceiving time,” Dudukovic said. Changing your environments — stepping out of the house, going on walks, or even switching up the room you work in — can trick your brain into thinking more is happening, so that time passes more regularly. If your days blend together, save certain activities and routines for specific days of the week. “Make your Tuesday a Tuesday because of the things you do in it,” Ogden said. Finally, try to keep busy. The busier we are, the less we tend to focus on how time is passing. On Assignment For HuffPost"
2,Republicans Cheer As Congressional Candidate Demands Fauci’s Execution By Firing Squad,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Oklahoma GOP Chair John Bennett, who is running for Congress, said he wants to put Dr. Anthony Fauci in front of a firing squad ― and the crowd at a campaign event clapped and cheered. “We’re fighting communist Democrats, establishment RINOs!” Bennett ranted in a video that Right Wing Watch shared online Tuesday, which has now gone viral. “We’re fighting against a system that stole the election in 2020 and nobody had been held accountable,” Bennett continued, parroting former President Donald Trump’s baseless election fraud claims. “We’re in a war with bureaucrats that have forced vaccine mandates on us, mask mandates on us.” Bennett then railed against something he described as “wokeness confusion,” which he alleged is being pushed “down our throats now.” Then came his sinister line about Fauci, who has been targeted by repeated death threats for his public health work during the coronavirus pandemic. “And by the way, we should try Anthony Fauci and put him in front of a firing squad,” said Bennett, not really expanding on what crime he believes Fauci has committed. Then he added: “And for the Secret Service, if they’re listening, I’m not advocating we kill Anthony Fauci … until he’s convicted of his crimes through a court.” John Bennett, chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party and a current GOP congressional candidate, declares that ""we should try Anthony Fauci and put him in front of a firing squad."" pic.twitter.com/We2c13LYsk Fauci, as a highly visible U.S. health official, has spoken about the barrage of conservative criticism, vitriol and violent threats he’s received for his public health advice during the pandemic. He called for the firing of Fox News’ Jesse Watters after the TV host in December urged young conservatives to “ambush” him and “go for the kill shot” with questions. “The only thing that I have ever done throughout these two years is to encourage people to practice good public health practices: to get vaccinated, to be careful in public settings, to wear a mask,” Fauci said at the time.

4,CDC Estimates 3 In 4 Kids Have Had COVID-19,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — Three out of every four U.S. children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all Americans had signs of previous infections, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers estimated in a report Tuesday. The researchers examined blood samples from more than 200,000 Americans and looked for virus-fighting antibodies made from infections, not vaccines. They found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between December and February, when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the U.S. The most striking increase was in children. The percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45% in December to about 75% in February. For Americans of all ages, about 34% had signs of prior infection in December. Just two months later, 58% did. “I did expect it to increase. I did not expect it to increase quite this much,” said Dr. Kristie Clarke, co-leader of a CDC team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections. The older people were, the less likely they had evidence of past infections, the study found. For those 65 and older, 19% had signs of prior infection in December and 33% did in February. That may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other COVID-19 precautions, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds, Clarke said. Clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection, and possibly longer. Studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization, but CDC officials stressed that the previously infected should still get COVID-19 vaccines. The study looked for any detectable level of antibodies; it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective. Scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures. Officials continue to urge Americans to get vaccines and boosters, which offer additional protection against COVID-19 for all, including those who were previously infected. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

6,Deborah Birx Says She Was ‘Paralyzed’ By Trump’s Disinfectant Claim,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dr. Deborah Birx revealed she had a resignation pact with other doctors on President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response team, and said Trump’s outlandish public comments during the early days of the pandemic made her wish she was in the “Twilight Zone.” Birx, in a sweeping interview with ABC News Monday about her work on the front lines of the pandemic, told the story behind Trump’s infamous April 2020 news conference in which he mused about using injected disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19. Birx, caught frozen on camera as Trump spoke, said she was “paralyzed” when the then-president brought that up. She said minutes later during Trump’s news conference that disinfectants were “not a treatment,” but was later lambasted for failing to call out Trump and others in his White House for spreading disproven and at times dangerous ideas. Vehemently rebutting Trump’s claim would have been the “logical and important thing to do,” Birx acknowledged to ABC News. But “I was paralyzed in that moment because it was so unexpected.” “I just wanted it to be ‘The Twilight Zone’ and it all go away,” Birx continued. “I could just see everything unraveling in that moment.” Birx spoke ahead of the release of her book, “Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, COVID-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It’s Too Late.” As The New York Times noted, Birx was sidelined shortly after that news conference. She explained that she wasn’t fired, which would have triggered a pact with other doctors, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn, to all resign if any of them were forced out. .@DrJAshton on Pres.

7,White House: Without Funding U.S. Will Lose COVID Treatments,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — For much of the past two years, America has been first in line for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number. Already the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes. Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House. Months ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad. The Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic. The White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity. Paxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year. The U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.” Now, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind. Japan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer. Because of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill. “We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.” Complicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year. Last month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer. Administration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements. The funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant. Moderna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall. The Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses. Earlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses. Republicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23. An election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway. “Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once. There are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage. Such a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt. Republicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. It would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings. ___ AP writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.

9,"My At-Home Rapid Test Is Negative, But Could I Still Have COVID?",coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost In the age of omicron, where COVID’s attack rate is higher than previous variants, entire households and friend groups are getting sick. If one person gets COVID, there’s a good chance others in their home will also get infected. What’s odd, though, is occasionally only one or two people in that friend group or family unit will test positive on a rapid test. The rest, though symptomatic, test negative. Are rapid tests missing more infections now than they did with previous variants? Despite the anecdotal evidence, the latest research suggests the kits work just as well on omicron as they did with delta (meaning they can catch about 80% of cases confirmed by a positive PCR test). “In general, the rapid tests seem to be performing on par with omicron as well as the other variants,” Wilbur Lam, a professor of pediatrics and biomedical engineering at Emory University and a researcher who has been evaluating COVID diagnostic tests for the federal government, told HuffPost. Rapid antigen tests are designed to detect a specific version of a virus. As variants have emerged, scientists have wondered if the new mutations could impact rapid tests’ ability to detect the changing virus — but this hasn’t been the case. Most evidence suggests that rapid antigen tests work just as well with omicron as they did with previous variants like delta and alpha. A study from UMass Chan Medical School found that rapid tests caught 92% of omicron infections and 82% of delta infections that had been confirmed on a positive PCR test. There’s not as much research on how the tests hold up with omicron’s subvariants, like the now-dominant variant BA.2, but Nathaniel Hafer, an assistant professor of molecular medicine at UMass Chan Medical School who worked on the UMass study, isn’t too concerned. “My hunch is that these tests can still detect BA.2,” he said. BA.2 is a subvariant of omicron and variants have been consistently detected by rapid antigen tests all along, largely because the piece of the virus these tests look for hasn’t mutated too much, according to Hafer. Still, rapid at-home tests aren’t foolproof, and there have been enough anecdotes to show they’re missing some percentage of cases. Scientists have a few theories as to why this might be. First, is the heightened transmissibility of omicron and its subvariants (like BA.2). These variants are spreading so quickly that many people are likely testing themselves too soon, before the virus has had a chance to really multiply in the body. “There might actually not be a high enough concentration [of virus] in the nose for it to pick up yet,” Lam said. Another theory: Omicron is more present in the throat than the nose. During the height of the omicron wave, tons of people shared their experiences on Twitter about how they tested positive via a throat swab after their nose swabs yielded negative results. However, Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at Yale School of Public Health, said we don’t have accurate estimates on this because the FDA hasn’t authorized rapid antigen tests for oral swabs. “It is where omicron is first detectable, which is why people continue to test negative for days with nasal swabs, yet [are] exhibiting symptoms,” Wyllie said. But studies have specifically looked at this and found that omicron is everywhere — the throat, the nose, our saliva — and oral swabs, though useful, are no better than nasal swabs. Some scientists suspect that vaccination may decrease the viral load in certain people’s nasal cavities. Essentially, their immune systems may already be fighting the virus and preventing it from replicating itself — rapid tests need a high viral load to produce a positive test, so if there isn’t enough virus present, the test kit won’t detect it. Lam and his research team are actively studying how vaccination status and the timing of vaccination and boosters impact viral load and sensitivity of the tests, but don’t have results yet. “We think that perhaps a person that’s recently boosted might be prone to having lower sensitivity — but that’s still our hypothesis,” Lam said. Everyone’s immune systems are a little bit different. Some people’s immune systems might simply fight and block the virus from replicating more successfully than others. Additionally, symptomatic people tend to have higher viral loads, which are more detectable on a rapid antigen test, than asymptomatic people, who typically have lower viral loads. “People who have higher viral loads in their nose and in their head cavities are definitely going to be more likely to be positive on an antigen test,” Hafer said. There’s always the chance people could also have symptoms for different reasons — seasonal allergies and other common respiratory viruses are back and circulating, Hafer added. Lastly, there’s likely some human error involved. Some may not swab deep enough or enough times, which would impact how much virus a swab collects. The tests also work best with serial testing, or testing over multiple days. This gives the viral load the opportunity to build up and reach levels that are detectable on a rapid test, Lam said. On average, PCR tests — which are much more sensitive — show positive results about two days before rapid tests. So while you might get a negative test result on your first day of symptoms, there’s a much better chance your rapid test will turn positive a couple days later once your viral load is higher. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,Donald Trump Jr. Says He'll Keep Wearing A Mask For 1 Reason,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump Jr. previously railed against mask mandates aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, but former President Donald Trump’s eldest son admitted on Thursday that he would continue to mask up. Why? “For anonymity,” so he can “stay under the radar,” he wrote on Twitter. He’s not alone. Trump Jr.’s admission came as he questioned polling showing the majority of Americans support mask mandates on airplanes and trains after a federal judge struck down the federal coronavirus mask mandate on public transportation. The Department of Justice is appealing the ruling. “Must be a lib poll,” the Trump scion wrote, noting how “about 90%” of people he’d seen while flying out of airports in Miami and Cleveland this week weren’t wearing face coverings. “I’m sitting in an airport now and I can see 60+ people and can count 5 masks including me but I’m wearing one for anonymity not bc I think a small cloth does anything,” Trump Jr. added.

3,Pennsylvania GOP Senate Race Full Of Flip-Flopping On COVID Precautions,coronavirus," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Two of the leading Republican Senate candidates in Pennsylvania have embraced masks and vaccines as precautions against contracting COVID-19, with one even saying that masks shouldn’t be a “political statement” and are about “being kind.” But that was all before they began embracing the MAGA brand and running to the far-right to nab the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania. These days, Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick are trying out outdo each other in their contempt for COVID-19 protections. McCormick, the former CEO of hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates, has been hammering Oz for his past support for masks. “Mehmet Oz will read whatever script is put in front of him. There was no greater supporter of mask mandates than Oz,” he tweeted Monday, along with a video compilation of Oz previously promoting masking up. Mehmet Oz will read whatever script is put in front of him. There was no greater supporter of mask mandates than Oz. https://t.co/zBxZ0VXfTR pic.twitter.com/5fwKz1Blcz Matt Wolking, a GOP adviser working for the McCormick campaign, also highlighted a December 2020 tweet from the celebrity doctor ― better known as “Dr. Oz” ― promoting mask usage. https://t.co/1fU6yGTqci That’s a very different line than what Oz is saying these days. This week, Oz was on Fox News saying the left is “forcing” mask mandates on people, even though they “don’t work.” Oz has also spoken out against businesses mandating vaccines for employees and said that President Joe Biden’s administration misled the public about what the COVID-19 vaccine would be able to accomplish. “I would block the ability of a private company to insist that employees have invasive procedures, which a vaccine is,” Oz told The Washington Examiner. “It should be up to the employee.” Oz communications director Brittany Yanick said Oz stands by his belief that the “need to end mask mandates is long overdue.” “Since the beginning of the pandemic, Dr. Oz has been warning of Dr. Fauci and the medical establishment’s mismanagement by debunking false narratives and speaking out about the dangers of lockdowns and mandates,” Yanick said in a comment to HuffPost. “They politicized the science and they have flip-flopped on their mask and vaccine guidance so many times that they have not only lost the trust of the medical community, they’ve lost the trust of the American people. ... Sadly, entrenched members of our country’s medical establishment refuse to acknowledge the damage that is being done through harsh mandates that do not make us safer and they have ignored natural immunity.” Oz, however, has made comments praising lockdowns and stay-at-home orders. In April 2020, however, he did call for schools to be reopened, saying that it might be a “trade-off some folks would consider” since it “may only cost us 2 to 3 percent in terms of total mortality.” He then apologized for those remarks after facing backlash. McCormick, too, has blasted mandates. “I think that the headline principle here is that the government should not be dictating individual behavior in terms of masks or vaccines or testing, and that the principle of individual freedom and individual responsibility should be what drives our policies in these cases,” he added in a March 11 interview on “The Rich Zeoli Show.” In a Feb. 15 interview on “The Brian Kilmeade Show,” McCormick ― talking about the Super Bowl ― blasted “the absolute hypocrisy of the of these mask mandates,” which are “being put in place by officials, being put in place by elites, and then ultimately they don’t follow them themselves.” But last year, Bridgewater mandated that its employees be vaccinated before returning to the office, and that they wear masks when they return. McCormick was CEO of the company at the time. McCormick spokesperson Jess Szymanski distinguished between mandates imposed by government and those imposed by businesses. “Dave is vehemently opposed to government vaccine and mask mandates and supports the rights of individuals and private companies to make decisions that best suit their unique situation. He also believes companies should work closely with their workers to accommodate their own health care decisions as best they can,” she said. Bridgewater also tried to accommodate individual needs and preferences with COVID-19 vaccinations through a combination of testing and working from home, and other protocols that were largely successful. Nevertheless, McCormick’s actions at Bridgewater ― and the seeming acknowledgment that there was a benefit to masks and vaccination ― is out of step with his current rhetoric. Oz and McCormick are the front-runners in the crowded, competitive GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania, set for May 17. Both men have shifted to the far-right during their runs. Bloomberg Businessweek summed up McCormick’s transformation as thus: “To the astonishment of the Bridgewater crowd, he shed his smooth, Davos Man persona and transformed himself faster than Clark Kent in a phone booth into a Trump-touting, China-bashing MAGA acolyte.” Oz’s transformation has been even more obvious, in large part because of his celebrity status and long public record in his television appearances and columns. He has shifted on everything from abortion to environmental policies as he and the other candidates in the field jockeyed to win former President Donald Trump’s favor. On April 9, it paid off for Oz. Trump endorsed the celebrity doctor, even though many of his longtime advisers were pushing him to back McCormick. According to The Washington Post, Trump was upset about a 2021 video in which McCormick praised Joe Biden and blamed Trump for polarization in the country. This story was updated with comment from the Oz campaign. Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Biden Says It's Up To Americans To Decide Whether To Mask Up In Planes,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration has been working for months to prepare people to rethink their personal risk calculations  as the nation gets used to the idea of living with an endemic COVID-19. But that measured approach disappeared abruptly when a federal judge on Monday threw out the federal requirement  to mask up when using mass transit. The ruling added to the urgency of the messaging challenge as the administration tries to move past the virus in the lead-up to midterm elections. After the government last month eased indoor mask-wearing guidelines for the vast majority of Americans – even in schools — masking on planes was one of the last redoubts of the national COVID-19 restrictions. Now, as the policy falls, the administration turns to accelerating its efforts to provide the best advice for millions making their own personal safety decisions in the still-dangerous pandemic. It’s both a public health imperative and an important shift in emphasis for Biden’s political future. “There is an opportunity now, instead of saying this is a disappointing ruling, they could say this is a good time to have a conversation about how we move forward in this pandemic about risk calculation,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “With COVID-19, I think we’re at a point with immunity from prior infections, vaccines, home tests and treatments that we can start to manage this the way we manage other infectious diseases,” he said. Biden himself went all-in on flexibility Tuesday when asked if Americans should mask up on planes. “That’s up to them,” Biden declared during a visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. But his own White House nonetheless continues to require face coverings for those traveling with him on Air Force One, citing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. JUST IN: ""That’s up to them,"" Pres. Biden says when asked if travelers should continue to wear masks on airplanes after federal mask mandate overturned. https://t.co/tyfkAeACuk pic.twitter.com/pZ3zIt3G3F The shift toward less formal regulation was actually previewed in a 100-page plan released by the White House coronavirus response team in February. Back then, administration officials had hoped that children under 5 would be eligible for vaccination by now — a move that would have eased the concern of millions of parents and provided the umbrella of protection to nearly everyone in the U.S. who wanted it. Monday’s court order lifting the mask mandate came at a crossroads in the nation’s pandemic response, just shy of a year to the day from when all American adults were eligible for vaccination against COVID-19. The ruling sent government agencies and the White House scrambling to comply, but that didn’t stop momentary confusion among travelers as airlines and airports dropped their mask requirements — in some cases mid-flight. A flight attendant sang a surprise song for passengers at the end of a flight – telling them they could throw masks away, because the mandate ended while they were in the air. pic.twitter.com/ZXeHttHZdf The administration stressed that Americans should still comply with CDC recommendations to wear face coverings, even in the absence of the mandate. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said as much just an hour before his “up to them” comment. “The CDC continues to advise and recommend masks on airplanes. We’re abiding by the CDC recommendations, the president is, and we would advise all Americans to do that,” she said. On Tuesday, Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said officials believe that the federal mask order was “a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given CDC to protect the public health.” He said it was “an important authority the Department will continue to work to preserve.” But he said the department would only appeal the ruling if the CDC determined that the mask mandate was still necessary for public health. As of Tuesday evening, the agency hadn’t made a determination, officials said. Psaki on Tuesday indicated that while the administration was disappointed with the ruling, it didn’t rank with Congress’ inability to reach a compromise on additional COVID funding to purchase booster shots and antiviral treatments. “Those are our biggest concerns,” she said. Face-covering requirements, which have proven to lower the risks of infection, have grown increasingly political in the U.S. over the last year, particularly as cases and severe outcomes have fallen. The lingering mandate for public transit and air travel served as a daily reminder for many people that the pandemic they badly wanted to be over was still affecting their lives, even if vaccinations and antiviral treatments had dramatically lowered their risk. For others who are still fearful of the virus, each roll-back of pandemic restrictions has sparked fresh disquiet — and in some cases criticism of the Biden administration. “There are still a lot of people in this country who still want to have masks in place — either they have immunocompromised relatives, they have kids under 5, whatever it may be,” said Psaki. Monday’s court ruling hastened an outcome that was likely coming in weeks anyway. Many administration officials believed that last week’s 15-day extension of the mask order to May 3 would be the last. The public health agency had asked for the additional time to monitor whether a recent rise in infections would result in increased hospitalizations or deaths. So far it hasn’t. The court’s order caught the administration by surprise and left it struggling to grasp its impact — both on the requirement’s end and on CDC’s authorities going forward. “CDC scientists had asked for 15 days to make a more data-driven durable decision,” Dr. Aashish Jha, the new White House COVID-19 coordinator, tweeted on Tuesday. “We should have given it to them.” 24 hours ago, a federal judge vacated @CDCgov mask mandate on airplanesThis was deeply disappointingCDC scientists had asked for 15 days to make a more data-driven durable decisionWe should have given it to themBut I'll continue to follow CDC guidance & mask up on planes The uptick in cases and a recent spate of positive cases in Biden’s orbit — including second gentleman Doug Emhoff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — was a potent reminder that the virus isn’t going away. Biden, 79, was never identified as a “close contact” under CDC guidelines, the White House said, and officials emphasized that he is strongly protected against the virus by being vaccinated and twice-boosted. Controlling the virus that has killed 986,000 Americans has been a priority for Biden since taking office. The U.S. now averages about 35,000 confirmed cases per day, down from a high of more than 806,000 during January’s omicron surge, but up slightly from lows of about 26,000 a month ago. Those figures are surely an undercount since many people don’t report the results of at-home tests to public health authorities. ___ Associated Press writers Chris Megerian in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Michael Balsamo in Washington contributed to this report.

8,How Much Does One-Way Masking Protect You From COVID On A Plane?,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost After a federal judge in Florida struck down the mask mandate on planes and other forms of public transportation on Monday, most major airlines — including American, Delta, United, Southwest, Alaska, Spirit and JetBlue — swiftly announced that masks were no longer required on domestic flights and certain international flights. While some passengers are thrilled that they no longer need to wear masks, many others are concerned about the safety of using mass transportation among a bunch of maskless strangers. But infectious diseases specialists say one-way masking is still worth it. “We like to think of situations as being safe or unsafe, but the question of masking effectiveness falls onto a gradient,” said Dr. Andrew Handel, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital. “One-way masking is less effective than two-way masking, but is more effective than not wearing a mask at all.” One-way masking is very protective ― especially when a high-quality mask like an N95, KN95 or KF94 is worn, since they can better filter viral particles out of the air you breathe. Though cloth masks and surgical masks do little to protect us against the coronavirus’ extremely contagious omicron variant, studies have shown that a good, well-fitting mask significantly decreases how much virus a person is exposed to, which in turn lowers the chances they’ll get infected. “With omicron, better masks such as surgical or higher are preferred,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. After all, this is what doctors treating COVID patients have been doing in intensive care units across the country. Adalja routinely one-way masks (mostly with an N95, but occasionally with a surgical mask) when treating patients with tuberculosis or COVID in the hospital. “It is very safe and the norm,” Adalja said, adding that the same applies to the general population. Airplanes also have great air filtering systems that remove the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 from the air. This makes flying safer than many other crowded indoor activities where masks haven’t been required, according to Adalja. Many experts advise people to continue to wearing high-quality masks while in crowded settings like airports, planes or trains ― especially people who are at risk or immunocompromised. “I would recommend an N95, KN95, FFP2, KFN94 or double masks (surgical plus cloth) on public transportation if patrons want less exposure, per the physical science studies,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of California, San Francisco. If you choose to one-way mask, you’ll want the mask to fit snug to your face so there aren’t gaps around your nose, cheeks or chin. The more gaps there are, the more opportunities a virus has to sneak in. While the majority of young kids are not at risk of severe disease from COVID ― especially if they’ve already had COVID or have been vaccinated ― you still want to protect them. Flying around other unmasked passengers may feel unnerving, especially for parents with kids who don’t yet qualify for the shots. Each parent will have to consider their child’s health when determining whether they should mask while traveling. “For high-risk children who can wear a mask, one-way masking works,” Adalja said. Experts also recommend turning on the air vent above your seat to keep filtered air flowing around you. If your child is at risk or unvaccinated, Handel recommends minimizing the amount of time your family spends hanging around the airport unmasked. “Airplanes have better air circulation than we give them credit for, which reduces the risk of contracting COVID,” he said. “But we should keep in mind the other steps [needed] for traveling, like sitting in the airport or in a crowded location, where we can also contract COVID.” Additionally, making sure that family members are vaccinated will help keep young kids safer from getting infected. Being extra cautious with those young kids, by having them and any co-travelers wear a mask, will make them less likely to get COVID, Handel said. Experts say that people who have immunity are already well protected from serious illness. Even if your antibody levels wane four to six months after vaccination, in most cases, the immune system will still be able to fight the virus and keep people safe from severe illness, hospitalization and death. “I think for healthy people who are vaccinated or have prior infection, that they can consider themselves heavily protected against what matters most: severe disease,” Adalja said. That protection increases when people, including those who have risk factors for severe COVID, also wear a high-quality mask. Anyone who’s been vaccinated and is wearing a high-quality mask in an indoor setting can generally feel safe, Adalja said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

9,India Stalls Updated COVID-19 Toll Showing Millions More Deaths: Report,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost The World Health Organization currently says on its website that 6.2 million people worldwide have died of COVID-19. But more than a year of research aimed at calculating the true death toll has led the public health authority to more than double that estimate, according to The New York Times. The WHO reportedly puts the real number at around 15 million people, but it has yet to release those figures. India’s objections to the way those new numbers were calculated has delayed the release for months, the Times reported Saturday, citing more than 10 people familiar with the data. The WHO’s new estimate tells a far deadlier story about how the pandemic affected India, which experienced a massive wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths last spring. At least 4 million Indians died of COVID-19, the WHO reportedly believes, far outstripping the country’s official count of 520,000 deaths. The new numbers would make India the nation with the most COVID-19 deaths. Researchers combined reported deaths with household surveys, updated local information and statistical models, the Times said. Their results were supposed to be released in January, providing key information on understanding the pandemic, so that authorities may try to prevent the next one. The WHO told the Times it expects to release the figures this month. Many countries, including the United States, have had difficulty accurately tallying the number of COVID-19 dead due to insufficient testing, political factors and other reasons.

0,"For People With Anxiety Or Insecurities, It's Hard To Lose The Mask",coronavirus," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Priyam Mahajan, a 20-year-old who lives in India, has struggled with social anxiety disorder most of her life. In public, that plays out as a difficulty in making eye contact with strangers. Her face often tenses up in conversations or she’ll bite her lip, which only makes her more self-conscious around others. “When half my face is covered it helps me almost not be perceived fully,” she told HuffPost. “I can relax and be anonymous.” Now that states in India have started to lift mask mandates, Mahajan said she’s trying to push through her anxiety and let go of the mask. “I have noticed I really start missing the mask when I get into a pickle or a situation where my social anxiety piques,” she said. “For instance, the bus was really chaotic and crowded this morning and I wished I had my mask on so that no one could see me get anxious.” Like many women have noted during the pandemic, facial coverings have also given Mahajan a break from the leers and requests to “smile more” from men. “I feel safer with the mask,” she said. “I feel like I’m going to always keep my mask on hand for anxiety-inducing situations.” Seth, a 27-year-old health care worker in Massachusetts who has anxiety and autism, has also found comfort in masking. No one could look at his face and misinterpret what he was feeling. (Studies suggest that many neurotypical people find it challenging to read and interpret the facial expressions and body movements of autistic people.) “My face often doesn’t move in a way that suggests my mood,” said Seth, who like a few others in this story asked to use his first name only to protect his privacy. “With a mask, that’s not as big of an issue because there’s already an expectation with people at work that they will not be able to read my face as well and it diverts their attention elsewhere,” he told HuffPost. “It’s also kept my acne hidden and stopped me from picking at it.” As mask mandates have lifted throughout the U.S. in the last few months, Seth has felt grateful to work in a field where masks are still very much in use. “The mask feels like a security blanket in so many ways,” he said. Seth and Mahajan are not the only ones feeling conflicted and a little uneasy about reentering an increasingly maskless world. There are the obvious health concerns about unmasking ― coronavirus cases are once again on the rise due to the spread of the highly transmissible BA.2 variant. But there’s extra reluctance to give up the masks among people who have social anxiety disorder or who feel self-conscious about their appearance. For more than two years, masks have given them a reprieve from having to engage with others. Social anxiety disorder, a condition that affects an estimated 15 million Americans, is an intense, persistent fear of being watched, judged or scrutinized by others. “Without a mask, someone is more exposed to others seeing physical signs of social anxiety, like flushed skin or sweating,” said Rebecca Leslie, a psychologist in Atlanta. “A mask can make you a bit harder to recognize, particularly from afar,” she told HuffPost. “That provides a sense of protection to someone who is socially anxious or just does not want to run into people.” “I remember taking my mask off in front of a co-worker for the first time, and he said, ‘Oh wow, I’ve got to get used to seeing your face,’ which I obviously took in the worst connotation possible.” Masks have been a blessing to those who have body dysmorphia, a disorder affecting nearly 8 million Americans that causes people to dwell on one or more perceived flaws in their appearance. Leslie specializes in body image issues and said she’s had many clients speak about how liberating covering up has been. “A mask has a way of making people insecure about their looks feel just a bit more invisible,” Leslie said. “And without a mask, there can feel like there is more of a need to wear makeup or cover up perceived imperfections previously covered by a mask.” Brianna Plato, a 22-year-old in Florida who often feels insecure about her looks ― her nose especially ― said she’s certain she aced a job interview because she was masked up. “This was mid-pandemic and I was praying that the hiring manager wouldn’t ask me to take my mask off for the interview,” she told HuffPost. “I felt much more confident in it. I truly believe it’s one of the main reasons I got the job.” Florida was one of the first states to lift mask mandates, and Plato said she thinks going maskless has increased her body dysmorphia. Lately, “mask fishing” has been a concern for the 22-year-old. The term ― “presumably coined by my generation,” Plato joked ― is the idea that someone might be concealing facial flaws under a mask. It first emerged on dating apps and then trended on TikTok. “For instance, I remember taking my mask off in front of a co-worker for the first time, and he said, ‘Oh wow, I’ve got to get used to seeing your face,’ which I obviously took in the worst connotation possible.” Plato said taking photos sans mask can be triggering. “I’ll look at a photo and think, ‘There’s no way I really look like that?’” she said. “I feel as if having to wear a mask for so long and then all of a sudden not having to has worsened my insecurities tenfold."" The mask has also been a powerful protective tool for trans people undergoing hormone therapy or surgical procedures to change their physical characteristics. Social anxiety plays a role in Alexis Vandom’s reluctance to unmask, but most of her negative feelings about unmasking derive from potential threats to her physical well-being and her gender dysphoria. Vandom, 25, is trans, and masks have helped keep her jawline and Adam’s apple hidden. “I’m mostly concerned about the possibility of the wrong person noticing that I am transgender and lashing out at me,” she told HuffPost. “Public hostility toward my demographic is soaring on a national level, and although I am safer now that I live in Washington state instead of central Texas, I would prefer to be able to go about my day in relative anonymity.” Vandom is currently undergoing facial electrolysis and intends to keep her mask on until she gets facial feminization surgery later this year. Once she has healed from her operations, she’ll likely start going out without it. “After that point, I won’t be anywhere near as worried about transphobic people recognizing or confronting me,” she said. David Moscovitch, a psychologist at the University of Waterloo and a leading researcher in the treatment of adult anxiety, has been studying the effect of mask-wearing among those with social anxiety since the start of the pandemic. Masks have allowed people to hide their vulnerabilities, Moscovitch said, but shifting mask protocols during the pandemic have actually increased struggles with social anxiety. “While masks might help socially anxious people to feel safer and avoid the fear of scrutiny and evaluation, this kind of self-concealment is harmful in the long run because these behaviors keep anxiety going by preventing people from learning that their fears are exaggerated,” he said. Social anxiety arises out of the perception that one’s appearance or behavior doesn’t match social norms. Moscovitch’s research shows that shifting norms on mask-wearing ― fluctuating mask mandates, for instance ― heighten the fear of making a mistake and being judged negatively by others. “In regions where the majority of other people are no longer wearing masks, socially anxious people face a difficult decision: drop the mask and the associated self-concealment it provides or keep the mask and risk sticking out and calling attention to themselves by virtue of defying social norms,” he said. They may feel stuck in a lose-lose situation, Moscovitch said, and conclude that it’s easier for them to just avoid people and stay home altogether. That’s been the case for Chris, a 39-year-old from Alberta, Canada, who said he has a general phobia about being looked at or noticed. “The mask really made me feel less obligated to engage in mindless small talk,” he told HuffPost. “I’m still masking, but it’s hard because I live in a highly conservative area where people seem to disapprove of masking.” Chris’ facial covering garners a lot of attention. “It seems like people actively go out of their way to say something to me about it,” he said. “I had to go to the post office a week or so back and the only people I saw with masks were the employees. It felt like every eye in the store was on me and I felt incredibly uncomfortable.” The plethora of delivery services and curbside pickup options has made being a “shut-in incredibly easy.” “Now I can’t even go inside the corner store without anxiety and panic,” he said. Adjusting to the new normal of mask-wearing was a big hurdle for many of us. Readjusting to not wearing one ― when it’s safe to do so ― is going to take some getting used to, too, even for those who never struggled with social anxiety or insecurities about their appearance before this. Experts we spoke to have some advice for getting through it. Think about why you’re so resistant to unmasking. While facing old anxieties about your appearance or new ones, it’s important to acknowledge why you’re leaning so hard into wearing a mask, Moscovitch said. “Be honest with yourself about why you’re still wearing your mask: Is it to avoid contagion or is it because you’re socially anxious and it’s hard to let go of that security blanket?” he said. If you’re not anxious about catching COVID-19 and there are no public health restrictions preventing you from going out without your mask and you believe it’s safe to do so, challenge yourself to experiment with dropping the mask in social situations, Moscovitch said. “See how you feel,” he said. “You may be surprised to discover that dropping the mask enables you to feel more authentic and connected with others, happier and less lonely.” Start slow. Try removing your mask first in comfortable settings or with people who feel safe, said Sheva Rajaee, the director of the Center for Anxiety and OCD. Maybe you start by going maskless in less crowded places like a vaccinated friend’s house, or try showing your full face around people you trust and who you feel will not judge you. “These exposures will allow you to take small, confidence-building steps that can then build to bigger leaps, like going maskless to a party, or wearing bright lipstick to draw attention to the unmasked portion of your face,” Rajaee said. See if you can come up with a self statement to say to yourself to help reduce anxiety when you leave home without a mask, Leslie said. “Remind yourself that you lived your life without a mask before and we’re OK. See if you have data from your past to challenge some fears,” she said. If removing the mask is due to body image concerns, remind yourself you are more than your appearance. If you’re using your mask to cover up what you really look like, try to remind yourself that your worth is tied up in so much more than your looks, Leslie said. “Your body is there so you can live your life. We don’t want life to be focused on striving for this ‘perfect’ physical appearance,” she said. “You are human, humans have wrinkles, pimples and skin with pores. Give yourself permission to be human.” Work on reframing negative thoughts and distortions about yourself, said Monica Vermani, a psychologist and the author of “A Deeper Wellness: Conquering Stress, Mood, Anxiety and Traumas.” “For people with physical insecurities, reframing negative thoughts about their face, their weight gain, and their sense of unattractiveness can be a game-changer,” she said. “Rather than judge and self-scrutinize, have the same compassion for yourself that you have for others.” Reach out for help if you need it. Don’t hesitate to ask for help from your support network or from professionals, Moscovitch said. If you seek professional help, he said, know that cognitive behavioral therapy, also known as CBT, is a proven form of psychological treatment for social anxiety that helps people confront their fears and change their negative perceptions of themselves and others. Remember: Compassion is key. During times of uncertainty and transition, we need to have compassion for other people, and for ourselves. “We need to stay connected to how we are feeling and treat ourselves with kindness,” Vermani said. “And while we can’t know what someone else may be going through or dealing with in their life, we can choose to treat others with respect and kindness.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Strict Coronavirus Shutdowns In China Continue As Infections Rise,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Anti-virus controls that have shut down some of China’s biggest cities and fueled public irritation are spreading as infections rise, hurting a weak economy and prompting warnings of possible global shockwaves. Shanghai is easing rules that confined most of its 25 million people to their homes after complaints they had trouble getting food. But most of its businesses still are closed. Access to Guangzhou, an industrial center of 19 million people near Hong Kong, was suspended this week. Other cities are cutting off access or closing factories and schools. Spring planting by Chinese farmers who feed 1.4 billion people might be disrupted, Nomura economists warned Thursday. That could boost demand for imported wheat and other food, pushing up already high global prices. The closures are an embarrassment to the ruling Communist Party and a setback for official efforts to shore up slumping growth in the world’s second-largest economy. They come during a sensitive year when President Xi Jinping is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as leader. Beijing has promised to reduce the human and economic cost of its “zero-COVID” strategy, but Xi on Wednesday ruled out joining the United States and other governments that are dropping restrictions and trying to live with the virus. “Prevention and control work cannot be relaxed,” Xi said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. “Persistence is victory.” The risk that China might tumble into recession is increasing, Ting Lu, Jing Wang and Harrison Zhang of Nomura warned in a report. “The logistics crunch is worsening,” they said. “The markets should also be concerned about the delayed spring planting of grain in China.” The government reported 29,411 new cases Thursday, all but 3,020 with no symptoms. Shanghai accounted for 95% of that total, or 27,719 cases. All but 2,573 had no symptoms. A health official warned Wednesday that Shanghai didn’t have the virus under control despite its easing restrictions. Some 6.6 million people were allowed to leave their homes in areas that had no new cases for at least a week. But at least 15 million others still are barred from going outdoors. Most people have obeyed despite grumbling about shortages of food, medicine and access to elderly relatives who need help. But videos on the popular Sina Weibo social media service show some trading punches with police. Grape Chen, a data analyst in Shanghai, said she was panicking about getting medicines for her father, who is recovering from a stroke. She called police after getting no response from an official hotline but was told quarantine rules bar officers from helping. “We are willing to cooperate with the country,” Chen said. “But we also hope that our lives can be respected.” The city government of Suzhou, a center for smartphone manufacturing and other high-tech industry west of Shanghai, told its 18 million people to stay home when possible. Taiyuan, a blue-collar city of 4 million in central China, suspended inter-city bus service, according to the official China News Service. Ningde in the southeast barred residents from leaving. A restaurant cook in Taiyuan said his family has been confined to their apartment compound since April 3 after cases were found in neighboring compounds. “Our lives will be seriously affected if the restrictions last long,” said the cook, who would give only his surname, Chen. “My wife and I are earning nothing,” Chen said. “We have three children to support.” All but 13 of China’s 100 biggest cities by economic output are under some form of restrictions, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. “The intensity is increasing,” Gavekal said in a report this week. The volume of cargo handled by the Shanghai port, the world’s busiest, has fallen 40%, according to an estimate by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Automakers have suspended production due to disruption in deliveries of supplies. Restrictions on areas that produce the world’s smartphones, consumer electronics and other goods are prompting forecasters to cut expectations for this year’s economic growth to as low as 5%, down sharply from last year’s 8.1% expansion. The ruling party’s target is 5.5%. Growth slid to 4% over a year earlier in the final quarter of 2021 after tighter official controls on debt triggered a collapse in home sales and construction, industries that support millions of jobs. Even before the latest shutdowns, the ruling party was promising tax refunds and other help for entrepreneurs who generate wealth and jobs. Premier Li Keqiang, the No. 2 leader and top economic official, called this week for “quicker rollout” of aid for businesses that face a “key juncture for survival,” China News Service reported. Under a strategy dubbed “dynamic clearing,” authorities are trying to use more targeted measures to isolate neighborhoods instead of whole cities with populations bigger than some countries. But some local leaders are imposing more sweeping controls. Shanghai leaders were criticized for trying to minimize economic damage by ordering testing but no shutdown once cases were found last month. A citywide shutdown was ordered with only a few hours’ warning after case numbers soared. That was in contrast to Shenzhen, a tech and finance center of 17.5 million people near Hong Kong that closed the city March 13 after an outbreak and ordered mass testing. It reopened a week later and business returned to normal. Guangzhou has imitated Shenzhen. Most access to the city of 19 million was suspended Monday and mass testing ordered after 27 infections were found. Li Guanyu, a 31-year-old woman in Guangzhou, said residents can leave her apartment compound only once every other day to buy food but stores are well-stocked. “This happened a bit suddenly,” said Li. “Maybe the Shanghai situation is so bad that Guangzhou started mass testing and lockdowns as soon as cases were discovered.” ___ AP researchers Yu Bing in Beijing and Chen Si in Shanghai and video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing contributed."
2,California Postpones COVID Vaccine Mandate For Schools,coronavirus," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California is delaying a coronavirus vaccine mandate for schoolchildren until at least the summer of 2023. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration announced the change on Thursday. California was the first state to announce it would require all schoolchildren to receive the coronavirus vaccine. But the mandate will not take effect until federal regulators give final approval to the vaccine for children. That hasn’t happened yet. California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said school districts would need more time to implement the mandate once federal approval happens. State officials say the mandate will not happen before July 1, 2023. California is one of two states, plus the District of Columbia, that has announced a coronavirus vaccine mandate for K-12 public schools, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. California parents should have an easier time getting their school-aged children excused from the state’s upcoming coronavirus vaccine mandate after a state lawmaker announced Thursday he would stop trying to block personal belief exemptions from the new rules. Gov. Gavin Newsom has said the state will eventually require all California schoolchildren to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. He hasn’t done it yet because while federal regulators have authorized the vaccine for use on children in an emergency, they have not yet given it final approval. Once that happens, Newsom says the state’s vaccine mandate will likely take effect the following semester. State law would allow two exceptions to the coronavirus vaccine: Medical reasons and personal beliefs. A medical reason often requires proof from a doctor. But a personal belief exemption is easier to obtain, requiring a letter from the student or parent stating their objections. State Sen. Richard Pan, a Democrat from Sacramento who is also a pediatrician, authored a bill in the Legislature earlier this year that would have blocked students from using the personal belief exemption to avoid the coronavirus vaccine. Thursday, Pan announced he was holding the bill — meaning it will not become law this year. While nearly 75% of California’s population has been vaccinated, rates for children 17 and under are much lower. Just under 34% of children between the ages of 5-11 have received the vaccine, while just over 66.4% of children ages 12-17 have gotten it, according to state data. “Until children’s access to COVID vaccination is greatly improved, I believe that a state-wide policy to require COVID vaccination in schools is not the immediate priority, although it is an appropriate safety policy for many school districts in communities with good vaccine access,” Pan said in a news release. Pan did not say he pulled the bill because of a lack of support. A poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, found 64% of registered voters support coronavirus vaccine requirements for schools — including 55% of voters who are the parents of school-aged children. The poll was published in February based on a sampling of 8,937 California registered voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. This is the second vaccine-related bill to fail in the California Legislature this year before it even got to a vote. Last month, Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks withdrew a bill that would have forced all California businesses to require coronavirus vaccines for their employees — a decision she attributed to “a new and welcome chapter in this pandemic, with the virus receding for the moment.” Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have declined significantly following a winter surge of the omicron variant. State officials have removed most virus restrictions, no longer requiring masks in schools or other public places. “Definitely a lot of parents are excited that Sen. Pan is pulling this bill. It’s one less thing that they have to worry about,” said Jonathan Zachreson, the parent of three high-school children who founded the advocacy group Reopen California Schools. “The fact is kids ages 5-11 have had access to vaccines for quite some time and their low vaccination rates, I think, is evident of how parents feel about the vaccine.” Other vaccine-related bills are still alive in the California Legislature, including one that would let schoolchildren 12 and older receive the coronavirus vaccine without their parents’ permission. Currently, California requires parental permission for vaccines unless they are specifically to prevent a sexually transmitted disease."
3,FDA Authorizes First Breathalyzer Test To Detect COVID-19,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first breathalyzer test to detect COVID-19. On Thursday, the FDA announced that it was issuing an emergency use authorization for the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer, which detects coronavirus infections through breath samples. The test can provide results in under three minutes. So far, widely available COVID-19 tests are administered by swabbing inside people’s nostrils with a Q-tip and then testing the sample, with results taking anywhere from a few minutes for a rapid test to days for a PCR test. “Today’s authorization is yet another example of the rapid innovation occurring with diagnostic tests for COVID-19,” Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a release from the agency. He noted that this innovation could help with the current pandemic and “better position the U.S. for the next public health emergency.” In a study of over 2,000 people, the test was found to have 91.2% sensitivity (the rate of COVID-positive samples correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the rate of negative samples correctly identified). Clinical trials started in 2020, but the device was also tested specifically on the omicron variant, the FDA said. Health care providers can use the test, which is about the size of carry-on luggage, on patients in doctor’s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, according to the FDA. As the highly contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant of the coronavirus has been spreading in the U.S., cases nationwide have begun to tick back up. Case levels are still currently far lower than they were during the major winter spike. Vaccination remains the best method of protection against hospitalization and death from the virus.

4,Prince Albert Tests Positive For COVID A Second Time,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Prince Albert has tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time, his office said in a statement on Wednesday. “He is asymptomatic and his state of health is not a cause of any concern,” the Prince’s palace said in a statement shared with HuffPost. “He continues to work remotely and remains in permanent contact with the members of his cabinet, his government, as well as with his close collaborators,” the statement added. “This period of isolation will be adapted to the health measures in force.” The prince, who’s the leader of Monaco, was recently around other royals, as he attended the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip last month in London alongside Queen Elizabeth; Prince Charles; Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William; and Kate Middleton, among others. The queen, Charles and Camilla all tested positive for COVID-19 in February; it was the second time the Prince of Wales tested positive. Charles and Albert previously tested positive for COVID-19 around the same time in March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. Albert even held the unfortunate title of being the first head of state to test positive (though he was the second royal, after Karl von Habsburg, the archduke of Austria). The prince later denied that he gave Charles the coronavirus after the two attended the same event together on March 10, 2020. “We greeted each other from afar, each of us on opposite ends of the table,” Albert said in an interview with the French radio station RTL. “I was already there on the other side of the table, so we greeted each other from afar. ... So I don’t think I can be accused of having contaminated him,” Albert said, laughing. Charles was pictured doing a “namaste” greeting instead of shaking hands with people at that point in the pandemic.

5,UN: Ukraine War Threatens To Devastate Many Poor Nations,coronavirus," UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia’s war on Ukraine threatens to devastate the economies of many developing countries that are now facing even higher food and energy costs and increasingly difficult financial conditions, a U.N. task force warned Wednesday. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres released the report saying that the war is “supercharging” a crisis in food, energy and finance in poorer countries that were already struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and a lack of access to adequate funding for economic recovery. “We are now facing a perfect storm that threatens to devastate the economies of many developing countries,” Guterres said at a news conference. “As many as 1.7 billion people ― one-third of whom are already living in poverty ― are now highly exposed to disruptions in food, energy and finance systems that are triggering increases in poverty and hunger.” Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the U.N. agency promoting trade and development who coordinated the task force, said those people live in 107 countries that have “severe exposure” to at least one dimension of the crisis ― rising food prices, increasing energy prices and tightening financial conditions. In these countries, the report says, people struggle to afford healthy diets, imports are essential to meet food and energy needs, and “debt burdens and tightening resources limit government’s ability to cope with the vagaries of global financial conditions.” The report says 69 of the countries, with a population of 1.2 billion people, face a “perfect storm” and are severely or significantly exposed to all three crises. They include 25 countries in Africa, 25 in Asia and the Pacific, and 19 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, prices were already on the rise, “but the war has made a bad situation worse,” Guterres said. Thirty-six countries rely on Russia and Ukraine for more than half their wheat imports, including some of the world’s poorest countries, he said, and wheat and corn prices have risen 30% just since the start of the year. Russia is also the world’s top natural gas exporter and second-largest oil exporter, and Russia and neighboring Belarus export about 20% of the world’s fertilizers. Guterres said oil prices have increased more than 60% over the past year, natural gas prices have jumped 50% in recent months, and fertilizer prices have doubled. The task force said the world is “on the brink of a global debt crisis.” Grynspan, who heads the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, pointed to Sri Lanka’s default on a debt payment Tuesday and said other countries are asking for help. Guterres said the world can act to tackle the “three-dimensional crisis” and “cushion the blow.” The task force calls on countries to ensure a steady flow of food and fertilizer through open markets, lift export restrictions, and direct surpluses and reserves to those in need. Guterres said this would help keep a lid on food prices and calm volatility in food markets. On energy, the task force urges governments to refrain from hoarding, immediately release strategic petroleum stockpiles and additional reserves, and reduce the use of wheat for biofuels. Guterres urged countries to use the crisis as an opportunity to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. On finance, the task force issued “an urgent call for prompt and swift action from the international community” to help developing countries avoid another decade of lost economic development, “a generalized debt crisis, and social and political instability.” The task force says international financial institutions should provide emergency concessional financing to countries experiencing social and economic distress. It calls on the International Monetary Fund to increase limits for rapid financial assistance, suspend interest rate surcharges for two years, and explore the possibility of providing more liquidity “through special drawing rights or special measures targeted at the vulnerable and most affected countries.” Guterres said the upcoming spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank on April 18-24 are “a crucial moment” for decisions on many of these issues. He said it is crucial that their members understand the need to use money that is available to alleviate the suffering of people around the world. The U.N. chief said political will is key, and announced that he has asked six leaders ― the presidents of Senegal and Indonesia and the prime ministers of Germany, Barbados, Denmark and Bangladesh ― to mobilize political leaders to ensure that developing countries in crisis get the help they need."
6,CDC Extends Travel Mask Requirement To May 3 As Covid Cases Rise,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it is extending the nationwide mask requirement for airplanes and public transit for 15 days as it monitors an uptick in COVID-19 cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was extending the order, which was set to expire on April 18, until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant that is now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S. “In order to assess the potential impact the rise of cases has on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths, and health care system capacity, the CDC order will remain in place at this time,” the agency said in a statement. When the Transportation Security Administration, which enforces the rule for planes, buses, trains and transit hubs, extended the requirement last month, it said the CDC had been hoping to roll out a more flexible masking strategy that would have replaced the nationwide requirement. The mask mandate is the most visible vestige of government restrictions to control the pandemic, and possibly the most controversial. A surge of abusive and sometimes violent incidents on airplanes has been attributed mostly to disputes over mask-wearing. Separately, the Biden administration also extended for 90 days a public health emergency that has been in effect since early 2020. That allows temporary continuation of a range of public health measures that do have broad support, from more generous Medicaid coverage to flexibility around telehealth. The mask requirement for travelers was the target of months of lobbying from the airlines, who sought to kill it. The carriers argued that effective air filters on modern planes make transmission of the virus during a flight highly unlikely. Republicans in Congress also fought to kill the mandate. Critics have seized on the fact that states have rolled back rules requiring masks in restaurants, stores and other indoor settings, and yet COVID-19 cases have fallen sharply since the omicron variant peaked in mid-January. “It is very difficult to understand why masks are still required on airplanes, but not needed in crowded bars and restaurants; in packed sports arenas; in schools full of children; or at large indoor political gatherings,” Nicholas Calio, the CEO of industry trade group Airlines for America, said Wednesday in a letter to the heads of the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. “Simply put, an extension of the mask mandate does not make sense.” There has been a slight increase in cases in recent weeks, with daily confirmed cases nationwide rising from about 25,000 per day to more than 30,000. More than 85% of those cases are the highly contagious BA.2 strain. Those figures could be an undercount since many people now test positive on at-home tests that are not reported to public health agencies. Severe illnesses and deaths tend to lag infections by several weeks. The CDC is awaiting indications of whether the increase in cases correlates to a rise in adverse outcomes before announcing a less restrictive mask policy for travel. A poll in mid-March by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans are evenly divided over keeping the mask rule for transportation. The poll found that 51% wanted the mandate to expire and 48% said it should remain in place – in effect, a tie, given the poll’s margin of error. Democrats overwhelmingly supported the rule, and Republicans were even more united in opposing it. Vaccinated people and those with chronic health conditions favored keeping the rule, but by smaller margins. Airlines imposed their own mask mandates in 2020, when the Trump administration declined to take action. Unions representing flight attendants, which once backed mask rules, now decline to take a position because their members are divided over the issue. It is unclear whether eliminating the rule would make people more or less likely to travel on planes or subways. Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said that some people might start flying if they don’t have to wear a mask, and others might stop flying if other passengers are unmasked. He called both groups “fringe,” and he predicted that many people will continue to wear masks even if the rule is dropped. As for the broader public health emergency just extended by the Department of Health and Human Services, the administration has promised to give states 60 days’ notice before ending it. Winding down the emergency declaration could force an estimated 15 million Medicaid recipients to find new sources of coverage, require congressional action to preserve broad telehealth access for Medicare enrollees, and scramble special COVID-19 rules and payment policies for hospitals, doctors and insurers. There are also questions about how emergency use approvals for COVID-19 treatments will be handled. ___ David Koenig reported from Dallas.

8,Health Experts Warn COVID Cases May Go Undercounted As Testing Stalls,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Health experts around the globe are sounding fresh alarms over the coronavirus pandemic, even though official counts of infections and deaths continue a downward trend. The World Health Organization announced that over 496 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 6 million deaths had been reported globally as of Sunday. While the numbers look staggering, the U.N. agency said recorded cases and deaths were continuing an overall decline in all regions. Still, the WHO has warned that many cases may be uncounted as countries relax safety measures and reduce mass testing. Dr. Ashish Jha, the new White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, said Tuesday that the accessibility of at-home COVID tests may also contribute to undercounting, as people may not report their results to health authorities. He said the Biden administration has other tools to stay on top of the pandemic. “We’ve had undercounting throughout the whole pandemic, right? And that has always been an issue,” Jha told the “Today” show on NBC. “We have community-based surveys that we’re doing of infections. Obviously we’re looking at hospitalizations. Those are still at very, very low levels,” he added. “So I do feel like we have a pretty good grip of the overall picture.” .@SavannahGuthrie spoke with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. @ashishkjha about the rising COVID cases and mask mandates. pic.twitter.com/OZX62EaN3o Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who was formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, identified another reason why scaling back public testing could prove risky. “If you don’t test, then you don’t know what variants you have,” Mokdad told The New York Times. In its latest report, released on Sunday, the WHO said it’s tracking several omicron subvariants, including BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the XE variant, a combination of the original omicron strain and BA.2. BA.2 and the relaxation of public health measures has been driving an uptick in COVID cases in the U.S., following a similar trend in Europe. “Obviously I never like to see infections rising,” Jha told “Today’s” Savannah Guthrie. “I think we’ve got to be careful, but I don’t think this is a moment where we have to be excessively concerned.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has advised Americans to weigh their own individual COVID risks. “This is not going to be eradicated and it’s not going to be eliminated,” Fauci warned on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Dr. Anthony Fauci calls on Congress to pass additional COVID-19 funding so the U.S. can have resources prepared for another possible surge. “And right now if we don't get that support, we're not going to be ready for it,"" Fauci tells @jonkarl. https://t.co/0PR7AEcl1y pic.twitter.com/3lk43fyZ6I Fauci also emphasized the importance of Congress approving funding for additional testing, medication and vaccination, including a fourth booster shot.

2,At-Home Rapid COVID Tests May Expire Sooner Than You Think,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost If you’ve been stockpiling COVID-19 test kits in your cabinet, or recently received your free tests from the government, you might want to take note of their use-by dates, as most kits expire within a year. But even if your kit’s expiration date is approaching, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s time to trash it. Most of the expiration dates initially listed on the packaging labels were a prudent estimate based on preliminary stability tests. Over the past couple of years, additional testing has been conducted to determine the true shelf life of the various at-home tests, and, as a result, many test manufacturers have updated their products’ expiration dates. That said, you’ll still want to be mindful of how long your kit is good for. Using a kit that’s well past its expiration date could lead to inaccurate results that could give you a false sense of security. “Then you could make decisions based on something that’s no good,” said Cedric Yansouni, a scientist at the Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. The expiration dates vary from brand to brand, but generally range from six months to 15 months from the time they’re manufactured. Abbott’s BinaxNOW kits along with Ellume’s COVID home tests have a 15-month timeline; the orange iHealth kits are good for nine months. These expiration dates are based on stability tests the manufacturers conducted during development to estimate the kits’ shelf lives. But the expiration dates initially listed on the kits’ packaging labels are most likely conservative. “Typically, when you first market a new product, you’re going to be putting out a best-before date or expiry date that you know, for sure, will cover the period during which the product will give you reliable results,” Yansouni said. Eventually, certain rapid test ingredients ― like the solution in the droppers ― start to go bad. The whole idea behind the expiration dates is to ensure these components still work well so the tests provide accurate results, which helps people make informed decisions about their health. “The worst thing that can happen is being falsely reassured or falsely alarmed by a test result that was based on a reagent that is no longer valid,” Yansouni said. Keep in mind that the rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 are relatively new and have only been around for a couple of years. Though the initial stability tests helped manufacturers bring the test to markets quickly, determining the tests’ true shelf life takes time, as manufacturers must evaluate how the tests hold up over weeks, months, and maybe even years. Over the past two years, test manufacturers and government agencies have continued to test the kits’ durability and have updated various test kits’ expiration dates based on their newer findings. The BinaxNOW kit, for example, was originally marketed with a 12-month shelf life that has since been extended to 15 months. Similarly, the iHealth kits started with a six-month expiration date that was recently increased to nine months. For both of these kits, you can add three months to the expiration date listed on the box. Ellume currently has a 15-month shelf life, and a 21-month shelf life is currently under review, according to an Ellume spokesperson. To see if your test kit’s expiration date has been recently updated, visit the Food and Drug Administration’s page on diagnostic tests. Scroll down to the table of tests and enter “OTC” in the search bar. Then, find the test you are looking for, click on the + symbol to the left of the kit name, and look for a letter granting EUA revisions. You can also call the test kit manufacturer, such as Abbott Diagnostics or Ellume Limited, and ask if they’ve updated the expiration date of your specific kit. Yansouni expects that, eventually, the at-home kits could have a shelf life of up to 24 months, as that’s pretty typical of rapid diagnostic antigen tests used for other health conditions. Yes, but with some considerations. Sheldon Campbell, a lab testing expert at Yale Medicine and professor of pathology at Yale School of Medicine, said if a test was only a week or so past its expiration date, he’d probably use it. That’s “with the caveat that if it was negative and I really was afraid that I had COVID, then I’d get retested. And if it was positive, then I’d probably call that a positive,” Campbell said, adding that he’d discard them shortly after their expiration date. If the test result is important to you, you probably want to be confident in the result and use a kit that hasn’t expired. If you use a kit well past its most recently updated expiration date, you run the risk of getting an inaccurate result. (False negatives are more common, but false positives do happen.) “The only thing worse than no result, is a result that’s lying to you,” Campbell said. “Don’t use one that’s six months outdated.” If you get your kits from a local pharmacy, try to find kits with a later expiration date so you can hold onto your kit for a bit longer. Even if you’re within the expiration date, the kits are only valid if they’ve been stored adequately — a detail that’s often overlooked. The kits can quickly go bad if they end up in a very cold or very warm environment. (You want to store it between about 40 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit.) “Even in a car on a sunny day for a couple of hours, you could ruin your whole box of tests,” Yansouni said. And there’s not really a way for you to tell if an at-home test is no good. Campbell recommended being intentional about when you order your kits, as you don’t want them sitting on a mail truck in the dead of winter when they could freeze and thaw out or in the peak summer months when they could bake in the heat. Once you receive a test kit, make sure the package is sealed and hasn’t been previously opened and has a moisture-absorbing bag of crystals (silicon) ― humidity is a test killer. Check the expiration date, and if your kit’s date has passed, visit the FDA’s website to see if the date has been extended. If it hasn’t, your test result will not be reliable. “You’re better off using something else,” Yansouni said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

4,"Two Acquitted In Whitmer Kidnapping Plot, Jury Hung On Two More",coronavirus," GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — Two of four men were acquitted Friday in a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, motivated by fury at the Democrat’s tough COVID-19 restrictions early in the pandemic. The jury’s verdicts against Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were read in the federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in the case presided over by U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker. Jurors said they couldn’t agree on verdicts again Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. Prosecutors described Fox as a ringleader of an anti-government group. Fox, Croft and Harris faced additional charges. The two most serious charges, kidnapping conspiracy and conspiracy to use explosives, both carry potential life sentences. Defense attorneys portrayed their clients as credulous weekend warriors prone to big, wild talk, who were often stoned. They said FBI undercover agents and informants tricked and cajoled the men into agreeing to a conspiracy. To counter that entrapment claim, prosecutors entered evidence that the men discussed abducting Whitmer before the FBI sting began. They went way beyond talk, including scouting Whitmer’s summer home and testing explosives, prosecutors told jurors. Croft is from Delaware while the others are from Michigan. Earlier Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker acknowledged the struggle of deliberations. Decisions to convict or acquit must be unanimous. “I know it’s tough. We all know it’s tough,” Jonker told the jury. There were  10 charges in the case: one against Brandon Caserta, two against Adam Fox, three against Barry Croft Jr. and four against Daniel Harris. The men all faced the main charge of a kidnapping conspiracy; the other counts are related to explosives and a firearm. “It’s important to reach unanimity if you can. ... If you just can’t see it, then that’s what we need to hear eventually as your final answer,” Jonker said. Deliberations resumed earlier Friday with a court employee handing over a large plastic bag containing pennies, known as exhibit 291. The pennies were requested before jurors went home Thursday. Pennies taped to a commercial-grade firework were intended to act like shrapnel, investigators said. According to evidence, a homemade explosive was detonated during training in September 2020, about a month before the men were arrested. In his closing argument on April 1, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said Croft wanted to test the explosive as a possible weapon to use against Whitmer’s security team. He quoted him as saying the pennies would be so hot they could go “right through your skin.” The trial now has covered 20 days since March 8, including jury selection, evidence, final arguments and jury deliberations. Prosecutors offered testimony from undercover agents, a crucial informant and two men who pleaded guilty to the plot. Jurors also read and heard secretly recorded conversations, violent social media posts and chat messages. Prosecutors said the group was steeped in anti-government extremism and angry over Whitmer’s COVID-19 restrictions. Defense lawyers, however, said any scheme was the creation of government agents who were embedded in the group and manipulated the men. Croft is from Bear, Delaware, while the others are from Michigan. Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the plot, though she referred to “surprises” during her term that seemed like “something out of fiction” when she filed for reelection on March 17. She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. ___ Find AP’s full coverage of the Whitmer kidnap plot trial at: https://apnews.com/hub/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial ___ White reported from Detroit.

5,Biden's Federal Employee Vaccine Mandate Upheld In Appeals Court,coronavirus," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — President Joe Biden’s requirement that all federal employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 was upheld Thursday by a federal appeals court. In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court and ordered dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the mandate. The ruling, a rare win for the administration at the New Orleans-based appellate court, said that the federal judge didn’t have jurisdiction in the case and those challenging the requirement could have pursued administrative remedies under Civil Service law. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas by then-President Donald Trump, had issued a nationwide injunction against the requirement in January. When the case was argued at the 5th Circuit last month, administration lawyers had noted that district judges in a dozen jurisdictions had rejected a challenge to the vaccine requirement for federal workers before Brown ruled. The administration argued that the Constitution gives the president, as the head of the federal workforce, the same authority as the CEO of a private corporation to require that employees be vaccinated. Lawyers for those challenging the mandate had pointed to a recent Supreme Court opinion that the government cannot force private employers to require employee vaccinations. Twelve of 17 active judges at the 5th Circuit were nominated to the court by Republicans, including six Trump appointees. Judges Carl Stewart and James Dennis, both nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton, were in the majority. Judge Rhesa Barksdale, a senior judge nominated by President George H.W. Bush, dissented, saying the relief the challengers sought does not fall under the Civil Service Reform Act cited by the administration. The case marked ideological divides at the appeals court even before Thursday’s ruling. A different panel had refused in February to block Brown’s ruling pending the appeal. That panel’s vote was 2-1. There were no reasons given by the majority — Judge Jerry Smith, a President Ronald Reagan nominee, and Don Willett, a Trump nominee. But there was a lengthy dissent by Judge Stephen Higginson, a nominee of President Barack Obama, who said a single district judge “lacking public health expertise and made unaccountable through life tenure,” should not be able to block the president from ordering the same type of COVID-19 safety measures many private sector CEOs have ordered.

7,Nancy Pelosi Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has tested positive for COVID-19, her chief of staff announced Thursday, adding that she is currently asymptomatic. “The Speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided,” tweeted Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill. Pelosi, 82, will quarantine and follow CDC guidelines, Hammill added. Reporters were awaiting a news conference with Pelosi at the U.S. Capitol when they received word of her positive test just before 11 a.m. Pelosi on Wednesday had attended a signing with President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), among others, at the White House. A day earlier, she attended a similar signing attended by Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama. The majority of those pictured attending both packed events were not wearing masks, with the White House lifting a mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals on March 1. News of Pelosi’s positive test follows a number of other confirmed cases among high-profile White House officials in recent days. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday both tested positive for the virus. Garland and Raimondo had attended a dinner Saturday in Washington that has been linked to several other positive cases, including Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). Harris’ communications director, Jamal Simmons, also tested positive on Wednesday. Simmons had been in close contact with Harris, who planned to continue her public schedule while following CDC guidance for those who have been in close contact with a positive individual, the White House said.

8,Sen. Ted Cruz Went After Mr. T And Twitter Users Pitied The Fool,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Mr. T trended on Twitter Wednesday as people praised him for receiving a second COVID-19 vaccine booster and saying he’ll continue to mask up and socially distance “because the virus ain’t over, Fool!” I just received my 2nd Moderna booster vaccine, and I feel good! I am still going to wear my mask and keep my distance because the virus ain’t over, Fool! Grrr Not everyone appeared to be happy, though. “Bizarre,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote in response to the actor on the 1980s TV series “The A-Team,” whose real name is Laurence Tureaud. Cruz attempted to spin Trueaud’s tweet into an attack on Hollywood elites. Bizarre. 535 Members of Congress can attend the State of the Union without wearing masks, but it’s still not good enough for Hollywood. https://t.co/Q2czqdtjx5 But as the omicron BA.2 variant sparks another wave of coronavirus cases, many critics pointed out a flaw in Cruz’s comment: Are you saying some people (most) don’t have the “freedom” to get vaccinated or wear a mask, without you criticizing them? Why do you care if people are still wearing masks?  Like why?! Bizarre that you've got problems with someone making their own medical choices. And? I thought you were pro choice on masks! I still wear mine! Fled Cruz trying to start a fight with Mr. T? I’d love to see how this plays out! It’s called personal freedom. You should try it some day. Really, you as a representative of the United States, want to shame an individual or several individuals about their choices? We have sunk that far as a country? What happened to @MrT 's, body Mr. T's choice? Why should you care how anybody else wants to protect their own health? Bit of a government overreach don't you think? Why would you take it upon yourself to criticize someone for their personal decision to err on the side of safety? Do you know this person on a personal level?What kind of elected official are you? 🤡 But I thought you guys were all about freedom of choice and personal responsibility? Mr. T is making a personal choice. Surely you aren’t against people making personal choices. It’s a personal choice? Remember freedom? I thought you said it should be peoples choice? I dare you to say it to his face. What happened to freedom of choice? So, people can't CHOOSE to mask? Sounds like a mandate... And? I thought you were pro choice on masks! I still wear mine! Are you seriously going after Mr T now? You are about personal liberties. Let people choose what they wish. So it's not about everyone's freedom then? What do you care if someone wants to wear a mask We need a lot more people like @MrT who care about health and safety. Because the cases in many areas have jumped up 50% in the past 10 days. Not if you have elderly parents, unvaccinated children, or an immune compromised family member. Many of us do. Taking on @MrT, Ted?

9,What Your COVID Immunity May Be Like With A 4th Shot,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost A fourth COVID-19 shot has been authorized for people over the age of 50 along with those under 50 who are immunocompromised. The authorization comes as BA.2, a subvariant of omicron, spreads across the globe and escalates in parts of the United States, sparking concerns about how long immunity lasts after a booster. The latest evidence suggests antibody levels, which protect us from infection, wane about four months after a booster shot. T cells, the part of our immune system that protects us against severe illness, see a slight dip at the four-month mark but remain robust. This waning does not mean we’re no longer protected; real-world data shows that the vast majority of people who have received three doses are incredibly well protected from hospitalization (a 90% risk reduction) several months after their latest dose. “In three to four months, it will start to drop, but you’ll still be in pretty good shape,” said Otto Yang, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Here’s how quickly antibody levels decline, and what that means for your next booster: The data on antibody levels is limited, and not very well understood, but it appears that antibody levels wane, on average, about four to six months after a booster shot. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests vaccine effectiveness starts to wane about four months after a booster dose (which is, presumably, due to declining antibody levels). Among people who had received three doses during the delta wave, vaccine effectiveness against urgent care and emergency room visits was 97% within two months of vaccination; that dropped to 89% after four months. During the omicron wave, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in people who had three doses was 91% within two months after their latest dose and 78% after four months. A paper from the United Kingdom published in The Lancet last July found that antibody levels after two doses waned at the two-to-three-month mark, though antibody levels were still pretty high at that point with the Pfizer vaccine (higher than with the AstraZeneca shots). A report published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January 2022 found that while antibody levels declined six months after a Moderna booster, the remaining antibodies were still able to successfully fend off omicron. At this point, scientists don’t clearly know if there’s a specific antibody level that would indicate someone is well protected against infection — though it’s clear that higher levels of antibodies generally equal greater protection against infection. What we do know is that even when waning occurs, most people who have had booster shots continue to be safe from severe illness, hospitalization and death. Research shows that the pace at which antibody levels decline is somewhat influenced by age, gender (antibodies decline more rapidly in men), and immunosuppressive health conditions. But Yang, who studies our immune response against COVID-19, said he’s seen 100-year-olds with long-lasting antibody levels — so it’s not always so black and white. Protection against COVID-19 doesn’t depend only on antibodies. Where antibodies protect us from infection, the T cell response protects us against serious illness and death. And according to Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist with University of California, San Francisco, it looks like T cell immunity is going to be long-lasting, even against variants. Several studies have found that T cell responses remained nearly as effective against omicron, at six months after vaccination, as they were against earlier variants, Gandhi said. Yang, who studies T cell responses, noted that T cells may start to wane after a few months — but this does not mean they’re gone. “About three to four months after the third shot, after the first booster, the benefit of the vaccine preventing serious illness starts to drop, but doesn’t drop precipitously,” Yang said. If an antibody test showed that a person has no detectable antibodies then that means there are no antibodies circulating in their blood. It’s a bit more complicated when it comes to testing for T cells. T cells have a great memory, so even if a generally healthy person has low or undetectable T cells, they can reemerge, multiply very quickly and jump into action. This is most likely why real-world data shows the vaccine still protects most people from severe illness and death. The timing of the booster is where it gets tricky, as doctors have different takes. Yang recommended getting the second booster, i.e., a fourth dose, as soon as you’re eligible. Though we’re in a bit of a lull, COVID-19 is still circulating and you don’t want to have low immunity if exposed, especially if you’re at risk, he said. Doing so could also help prevent future waves. “If you’ve tolerated three doses of the vaccine already without any serious problems, you’re going to almost certainly tolerate the fourth dose — there’s so little downside, it’s worth getting it,” Yang said. Something else to consider, according to Yang: We need even higher levels of antibodies to fight these new variants, since they’re structurally different than the original strain that the vaccines target. “This is probably one of the reasons why boosters have been recommended so quickly,” he said. Gandhi, on the other hand, recommends timing your boosters to future waves (which is what she’s personally advising her parents, who are older and at-risk, to do). “You want your antibodies to be plump and high, especially if you’re vulnerable, around the time of typical surges,” Gandhi said. Officials believe COVID-19 may end up as a seasonal illness. However, seasonality varies from region to region — whereas the Northeast typically sees early fall and winter waves, Southern areas like Florida tend to experience summer surges when the hot, sticky, humid air sends people indoors. When in doubt, talk to your doctor. Most people who have had three shots are still going to be well protected from severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. But for the elderly, immunocompromised, and people with health conditions that put them at higher risk, it’s worth hearing your doctor’s take on how the benefits of getting a fourth dose now stack up to the risks of putting it off a bit longer.

3,Worried About New COVID Variants? Here's What To Expect.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Whenever a new COVID-19 variant is identified, fear and panic quickly sets in. It makes sense: We’ve been living through two-plus years of a brutal, scary pandemic. Before the data rolls in, many news headlines immediately jump to a worst-case scenario, speculating about whether the new coronavirus variant will be more pathogenic or drastically evade our vaccines. We’re constantly on high alert. The unfortunate truth is that, when it comes to COVID, there will always be new variants. Right now, we’re experiencing an uptick in BA.2. Experts discovered this week another possible strain, the XE variant, which is a combination of the original omicron variant and BA.2. And in a few months, we’ll likely be looking at an even newer one headed our way. We should expect this, and prepare for it. A new variant doesn’t have to mean there will be a doomsday situation. We have some really effective treatments now. We have mitigation strategies that we know work, like masking. There is a decent level of immunity in the population — from the vaccines and widespread infection — that it would take a lot for a new variant to offset every bit of the progress we’ve made in the past two years. That’s not to say we shouldn’t be cautious, but more that we should use what we’ve learned and created over the last two years to our advantage (and so should the people in charge of creating public health strategies). Here’s what to look at and consider whenever a new variant emerges: As long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, it will evolve and mutate into new variants. We now know that there are numerous animals that can contract the coronavirus. Throw in the fact that many people have never been immunized or exposed to COVID and that vaccinated people can spread COVID, and it seems pretty unlikely that COVID will be eradicated, at least anytime soon. The World Health Organization released a new plan last week suggesting that we exit the emergency phase of the pandemic and prepare for three possible scenarios of how the virus might evolve next. Scenario one: COVID continues to circulate and evolve, but the severity of illness will decline as immunity increases. The virus will likely become more of a seasonal illness (like the flu) and we may need to booster at-risk individuals on a seasonal basis. Scenario two: In the best-case scenario, future variants are much milder and eliminate the need for boosters — though we may intermittently get sick, we remain protected from severe disease. Scenario three: A more severe, more transmissible variant comes along. We already have a ton of immunity in the population, which will likely blunt the impact of the virus, but a widespread booster campaign, likely with updated vaccines, would be initiated to increase everyone’s immunity to that variant. When Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist with University of California, San Francisco, hears about a new variant, she first looks at the hospitalization rate in the region that it’s spreading in to see if and how it’s increasing. In areas of high vaccination, cases are no longer a completely accurate indicator of how severe a wave will be — as immunity has increased, hospitalizations have significantly decoupled from cases, Gandhi said. Keep in mind that at-home COVID test results are often not recorded by health departments, which makes it tough to determine what the true case count ― and therefore rate of hospitalization ― is in a given community. The vast majority of breakthrough infections do not lead to hospitalization, and infectious disease experts expect our immunity to keep protecting us from severe illness, even with other variants. For those who are at-risk, increasing case numbers may indicate it’s time for a booster or a high-quality mask. For those who aren’t high-risk, wearing a mask in public spaces and around someone you know is immunocompromised is an easy way to reduce transmission ― even if mandates aren’t in effect, you still have control over prevention. Benjamin Neuman, a professor of biology and chief virologist at Texas A&M University, says when it comes to variants, the severity of COVID mostly has to do with what’s going on inside the person, rather than the variant itself. Look at omicron. “In many countries with high vaccination rates, or high previous incidence of infection, omicron was relatively mild, most likely because there was enough immunity from vaccination or surviving COVID,” Neuman said. In Hong Kong, however, vaccination rates have been low and strict public health restrictions have been effective, which means there is less natural immunity in the population. As a result, omicron has been very severe. We saw a similar phenomenon during the delta wave — areas with high vaccination rates had low hospitalizations, and places with low vaccination rates saw a surge in hospitalizations. Long story short: It’s crucial to consider the immunity of the region experiencing an uptick in a new variant — both from vaccination and natural infection — to determine whether a variant is truly more pathogenic. Another thing to consider is that all of the variants we’ve seen so far — despite the fact that they’ve mutated and become more transmissible — are overall still pretty similar to one another. “Scientists like to track the variants because it shows how the virus is changing, but the most distant BA.2 variant is still around 99.7% identical to the original virus from 2019,” Neuman said. Polio, for example, has three main variants, all of which are around 80% identical to one another. “We can still do a reasonable job of vaccinating against all three variants with a single vaccine,” Neuman said, adding that the biggest difference between most SARS-CoV-2 variants, in practical terms, is often the name. It would take a variant with a lot of new mutations to drastically alter the current landscape. Gandhi said a red flag would be raised for her if suddenly there was an increase in younger people and vaccinated people being hospitalized for COVID. She would also be concerned if the symptoms changed. “Right now, it’s quite a predictable course and we know how to treat COVID in the hospital,” Gandhi said. But if COVID started impacting various organ systems differently, that would suggest a new variant picked up some concerning traits. According to Neuman, the next generation of variants are likely to come from the omicron and BA.2, since that’s what’s circulating. Even if the third scenario mapped by the WHO unfolds, the situation would not be be unassailable, Neuman said. “It is likely that some combination of more doses and omicron-like vaccines will be needed to keep people protected, at least in the short term,” Neuman said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

4,Biden Directs Federal Agencies To Support People Suffering From Long Covid,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Confronting the pandemic’s lasting shadow, President Joe Biden has ordered a new national research push on long COVID, while also directing federal agencies to support patients dealing with the mysterious and debilitating condition. Biden assigned the Department of Health and Human Services Tuesday to coordinate an urgent new initiative across federal agencies, building on research already under way at the National Institutes of Health. He also directed federal agencies to support patients and doctors by providing science-based best practices for treating long COVID, maintaining access to insurance coverage, and protecting the rights of workers coping with the uncertainties of the malaise. Of particular concern are effects on mental health. Long COVID is the catch-all term for a hydra-headed condition  whose symptoms can include brain fog, recurring shortness of breath, pain and fatigue. Rough estimates are that it affects as many as 1 in 3 people who recover from COVID-19, although the severity and duration of symptoms vary. Despite intense investigation, the causes of long COVID are not well understood and treatment largely focuses on helping patients cope with their symptoms as they try to rebalance daily routines. The White House also acknowledged that long COVID appears to be a disability, meaning that patients could be entitled to the protection of federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on health conditions and call for accommodations to allow people to lead productive lives. “The administration recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new members of the disability community and has had a tremendous impact on people with disabilities,” said a White House overview. Some independent experts praised the administration for its comprehensive plan but noted the lack of a timeline for results. “This is a very important move on the part of the Biden administration to acknowledge that long COVID is real, that it is a significant threat, and that much more needs to be done,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic. “The emphasis on treatment for long COVID, and recognizing that this could be a source of ongoing disability, are long overdue.” A prominent advocate for COVID patients sensed a breakthrough. “This is the first effort that truly comports with the needs of people who are suffering,’’ said Diana Berrent, founder of Survivor Corps, a support group that connects patients with government and private researchers. Advocates have been clamoring “for the government to create a command center for long COVID,” she added. “Up until now, that hasn’t existed.’’ “I see this as a global, comprehensive approach to an extremely thorny issue that has previously received a scattershot approach,” Berrent said. Medical research thus far has led to theories about what causes long COVID, but no single root. One theory revolves around lingering infection or virus remnants that may trigger inflammation in the body. Another possibility involves autoimmune system responses that mistakenly attack normal cells. Researchers are also investigating the role of tiny clots. The White House said Biden’s order will expand and build on a $1 billion research study already underway at NIH, called the RECOVER Initiative. One goal is to speed signing up 40,000 people with and without long COVID into the study. Around that effort, Health and Human Services will coordinate a government-wide research plan on long COVID. HHS will also deliver a report to the nation on long COVID later this year. “Millions of Americans may be struggling with lingering health effects,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “COVID is having effects long after the actual virus has escaped us.” Biden’s order puts a major focus on treatment. An HHS unit called the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will investigate best practices and get useful guidance to doctors, hospitals and patients. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which already has 18 facilities running long COVID programs, will serve as an incubator of ideas and strategies. The administration is seeking $20 million from Congress for “centers of excellence” to develop templates for care. Dr. Fernando Carnavali of Mount Sinai’s Center for Post-COVID Care in New York, said he understands complaints that the government hasn’t made enough progress on long COVID. “For our culture today, which needs answers yesterday, it’s just hard,’’ Carnavali said. “In chronic disease, in general it’s not how it works. We have other examples, from HIV, answers did not come right away.” Finally, the administration said its plan will provide direct support for patients by safeguarding access to insurance coverage and extending the umbrella of civil rights protections to people with long COVID. In keeping with Biden’s focus on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health care, part of the emphasis will be on minority communities that have borne a high toll from COVID-19. Federal health programs, which can serve as a model for private insurance, will look for ways to make sure that treatments for long COVID are covered and paid for. “The administration is working to make long COVID care as accessible as possible,” said a White House overview of Biden’s plan. ___ AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner contributed to this report.

6,CDC Says It Will Revamp Agency Following Pandemic Criticism,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that it will undergo a monthlong review and evaluation of its agency following criticism of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, in an agency-wide email obtained by The New York Times and The Washington Post, said the CDC has hired an outside senior federal health official to conduct the review of the agency’s “structure, systems, and processes.” “The lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the feedback I have received inside and outside the agency over the past year, indicate that it is time to take a step back and strategically position CDC to support the future of public health,” she said, according to the Times. Jim Macrae, who serves as associate administrator for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration, will conduct the review. He will begin on April 11. Three senior CDC officials will assist Macrae by collecting feedback on the agency’s structure and offer suggestions on what could be strategically changed, Walensky said. The goal of the process is to upgrade and modernize the agency’s “core capabilities.” This includes expanding its workforce, data modernization, laboratory capacity, health equity, and its response to disease outbreaks and preparedness, according to the Post. The CDC has for the past year worked to speed up data reporting and scientific processes amid its pandemic response. But this review will, among other things, work to institutionalize and formalize these processes, the agency told HuffPost in an email Tuesday. “These efforts will strengthen and transform CDC to better support the future of public health, and modernize and optimize the agency to deliver science and programmatic activities to the American people,” a spokesperson said. The agency has been hit with a barrage of pandemic criticism even before Walensky took over in early 2021. Critics have assailed the agency for such things as failing to immediately recommend face masks, being late to recognize that the virus is airborne, telling people who are fully vaccinated they can stop wearing masks indoors and then telling them they have to wear masks indoors. It has also been criticized for advising people who test positive for the virus but are asymptomatic that they can leave isolation after just five days, which was half of the previous recommendation. Walensky has acknowledged the various hurdles that have been flung at the agency. “Never in its 75 year history has CDC had to make decisions so quickly, based on often limited, real-time, and evolving science,” Walensky said of the agency’s pandemic handling in a statement Monday.

8,COVID-19 Temporarily Stops Daniel Craig's Return To Broadway,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — Could it be the curse of the Scottish play? Daniel Craig’s return to Broadway in a new version of “Macbeth” has been temporarily halted after the actor contracted COVID-19. Wednesday’s matinee and evening performances were canceled when the James Bond actor tested positive. In a tweet late Saturday night, the show said all performances were canceled through Thursday “due to the detection of a limited number of positive covid test results within the company.” Craig stars in a revival of William Shakespeare’s tragedy, with Ruth Negga making her Broadway debut playing Lady Macbeth. “Macbeth” is playing the Longacre Theatre, with an opening set for April 28. Tony Award-winner Sam Gold is directing. According to folklore, “Macbeth” was cursed from the beginning, when a coven of witches objected to Shakespeare using real incantations and put a curse on the play. Other productions have been plagued with accidents. Craig was last on Broadway in a 2013 revival of Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal” opposite his wife, Rachel Weisz, and directed by Mike Nichols. Craig also starred opposite Hugh Jackman in 2009′s “A Steady Rain.” Gold directed Craig in a 2016 off-Broadway production of “Othello” alongside David Oyelowo. Other high-profile shows on Broadway have had to cancel shows due to their lead actor’s contracting the virus, including both “The Music Man” leads, Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster."

1,Got COVID? Here Are All The Treatments Available Right Now.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Over the past two years, many new COVID-19 therapies have been designed, developed and rigorously tested. We now have a handful of safe and effective treatments — from monoclonal antibodies to antivirals — that can help people with COVID-19 avoid severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. But when it comes to COVID-19, things change fast, and it can be hard to keep up with what treatments are available and recommended. While certain therapies might work well against the dominant variants circulating today — which is looking more and more like the BA.2 subvariant of omicron — that could all change when the next variant comes along. On top of that, there are some nuances as to which treatments make sense for whom. Most of the therapies out there are intended for high-risk patients and some aren’t recommended for pregnant people or those taking certain medications like blood thinners or organ transplant drugs. “It’s important to talk to your doctor and they can review your list of medications and see which therapy is the right one for you,” said Thomas Lew, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University. Here’s a guide to the COVID-19 treatments currently available: What it is: Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced antibodies that help block a virus from invading our cells; in the case where the virus has already invaded our cells, monoclonal antibodies kickstart the immune system’s fight against the virus. They’re administered via infusion. Where we’re at with it: Monoclonal antibodies are targeted to a very specific virus, so they work best when they are used against the variant they are designed to treat. As the coronavirus mutates, the efficacy of our monoclonal antibodies tends to take a hit — in fact, a lot of the monoclonal antibodies we used earlier in the pandemic are no longer effective. “The landscape of monoclonal antibodies is always changing as the virus changes,” Lew said. For example, sotrovimab worked well against the original omicron (BA.1), but isn’t as effective against BA.2, so is being shelved in areas predominantly battling BA.2. Thankfully, another monoclonal antibody called bebtelovimab still appears to work great against BA.2, Lew said. Who qualifies: Monoclonal antibodies are typically reserved for high-risk patients who are not hospitalized and do not require oxygen but are at-risk for developing severe disease. This includes people over the age of 65, along with pregnant individuals and those with an underlying medical condition such as obesity, an organ transplant, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease or lung disease. Patients must be older than 12 and weigh at least 88 pounds. Once a person is hospitalized or requires oxygen, they no longer qualify for monoclonal antibodies, according to Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases physician. When to start treatment: Within seven days of symptom onset. Test early, and if you qualify, start treatment immediately — even if you only have mild, cold-like symptoms. How to get it: At an infusion center, hospital or urgent care. If you have a doctor, ask them where you can get tested and access the treatment in your region. You can find nearby locations that offer monoclonal antibodies here. What it is: An oral antiviral pill that blocks viruses from replicating and spreading in the body. Taken two times a day for five days, Paxlovid has been found to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 88%. “This is the most effective treatment currently available and works for all variants,” Roberts said. Where we’re at with it: Supply is tight in certain areas, but Paxlovid is now available at pharmacies, doctors’ offices, hospitals and urgent cares. Who qualifies: Any high-risk patient who tests positive qualifies, even if they don’t have serious symptoms, as long as they are over 12 years of age and weigh at least 88 pounds. Paxlovid has not been tested in pregnant people, and has drug interactions so it’s not recommended for people taking certain heart rhythm medications, blood thinners, or anti-rejection medications used for organ transplant patients. If you take any medications, ask your doctor or a pharmacist if you’re a candidate for Paxlovid. When to start treatment: Within five days of symptom onset. “Similar to Tamiflu for the flu, the earlier that Paxlovid is taken, hypothetically, the better the benefits to stop the virus from replicating,” Roberts said. How to get it: Paxlovid is only available by prescription, so talk to your primary care physician or visit an urgent care, emergency room or health clinic. You can find nearby locations that offer Paxlovid here. What it is: An oral antiviral pill that blocks the virus from replicating in your body. It is taken twice daily over the course of five days. Where we’re at with it: Molnupiravir is an alternative therapy that is given to patients who don’t qualify for Paxlovid or monoclonal antibodies along with people who don’t live near an infusion site. Molnupiravir helps protect people against hospitalization and death, but it is not as effective as Paxlovid. Who qualifies: Patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at risk for developing severe disease. It is not authorized for children younger than 18 because it may impact bone and cartilage growth. It is also not recommended for pregnant people. When to start treatment: Within five days of symptom onset. How to get it: Molnupiravir requires a prescription and can be picked up at a pharmacy. You can find nearby locations that offer molnupiravir here. What it is: An antiviral medication that inhibits viral replication in the body. It is administered via an IV and, depending on the severity of illness, is given for three days or five days. According to Roberts, remdesivir has always been a backbone in treating COVID-19 patients who require oxygen. Evidence has shown that three days of IV-administered remdesivir reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by 87%. Where we’re at with it: Recent research found that high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 are also strong candidates for remdesivir, and since then, the Food and Drug Administration authorized remdesivir for non-hospitalized at-risk people who have mild to moderate disease. Remdesivir is expected to hold up against the BA.2 variant. Who qualifies: High-risk patients who are already hospitalized or require oxygen along with high-risk patients who aren’t hospitalized but have mild to moderate COVID-19. At-risk pediatric patients under 12 can now get remdesivir, too. When to start treatment: Within seven days of symptom onset. How to get it: In the hospital. Expect more doctors’ offices, urgent cares and infusion centers to start offering remdesivir soon. The vast majority of healthy people who contract COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. “The strategy of testing, isolating and doing what’s called supportive care will be enough for those people,” Lew said. If you have a cough, take a cough expectorant (like dextromethorphan) that can loosen up the mucus in your airways. Roberts recommended pain relievers such as acetaminophen for those with a fever. People with congestion should look to nasal sprays or decongestants (like pseudoephedrine). People with asthma should consider using their prescription inhaler to keep their airways open, Roberts added. Gastrointestinal symptoms, like diarrhea, can be alleviated with loperamide. Lew also recommended drinking fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. There are a ton of COVID-19 treatments in development, including new pills, infusions and monoclonal antibodies. Several have shown promise in the early phases of their clinical trials, but it’ll take time to complete the final phases of testing (which happen to take the longest) and eventually reach the FDA’s desk for review. Until then, keep an eye on how future variants impact the efficacy of our current treatments and look out for new therapies that will work against all variants in the months and years to come.

2,"China Sends Military, Thousands Of Health Workers To Shanghai For Mass Covid Testing",coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — China has sent more than 10,000 health workers from across the country to Shanghai, including 2,000 military medical staff, as it struggles to stamp out a rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak in China’s largest city. The city was conducting a mass testing of its 25 million residents Monday as what was supposed to be a two-phase lockdown entered its second week. While many factories and financial firms have been able to keep operating by isolating their employees, concern was growing about the potential economic impact of an extended lockdown in China’s financial capital and a major shipping and manufacturing center. The highly contagious omicron BA.2 form of the virus is testing China’s ability to maintain its zero-COVID approach, which aims to stop outbreaks from spreading by isolating everyone who tests positive, whether they have symptoms or not. Shanghai has converted an exhibition hall and other facilities into massive isolation centers where people with mild or no symptoms are housed in a sea of beds separated by temporary partitions. China on Monday reported more than 13,000 new cases nationwide in the previous 24 hours, of which nearly 12,000 were asymptomatic. About 9,000 of the cases were in Shanghai. The other large outbreak is in northeastern China’s Jilin province, where new cases topped 3,500. The English-language China Daily newspaper said that nearly 15,000 medical workers from neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces left for Shanghai early Monday from their hospitals by bus. More than 2,000 personnel from the army, navy and joint logistics support force arrived on Sunday, a Chinese military newspaper said. At least four other provinces have also dispatched doctors, nurses and other medical workers to Shanghai, the state-owned China Daily said. While most shops and other businesses in Shanghai are shut down, major manufacturers including automakers General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG say their factories still are operating. VW has reduced production because of a disruption in supplies of parts. Businesses that are operating are enforcing “closed loop” strategies that isolate employees from the outside. Thousands of stock traders and other people in financial industries are sleeping in their offices, according to the Daily Economic News newspaper. Three out of five foreign companies with operations in Shanghai say they have cut this year’s sales forecasts, according to a survey conducted last week by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and the American Chamber of Commerce in China. One-third of the 120 companies that responded to the survey said they have delayed investments."

5,BA.2 Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing The Most Right Now,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost The highly contagious omicron subvariant BA.2 is now the dominant coronavirus strain around the world. Health officials have known about it since November, but they’re still learning about how it acts and how sick people infected with it are likely to get. With that in mind, here’s what the newest subvariant means for you and your family, as well as the signs you should keep an eye out for now. “So far what we’re seeing is really similar to the original omicron variant in terms of symptoms and in terms of severity,” said Dr. Erica Johnson, an internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore who chairs the Infectious Disease Board of the American Board of Internal Medicine. So, like the original omicron strain (BA.1), the primary symptoms of a mild BA.2 infection are a cough, fever, fatigue and possible loss of taste or smell. A runny nose, gastrointestinal issues, headache and a skin rash are other common signs and symptoms. Those are pretty similar to what people experience with a cold or other seasonal viruses. Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York, did note that with the original omicron strain, she saw more patients who seemed to present with upper respiratory symptoms (coughing, runny nose and sore throats) than with previous strains, which were more likely to cause lower respiratory symptoms (like a deep cough or shortness of breath). According to Lighter, BA.2 also seems to target the upper respiratory tract more like the original omicron strain did ― but again, a lot of that is just anecdotal at this point. And of course, it is possible to get really sick from BA.2. People should continue to be on the lookout for emergency warning signs, like persistent pain or chest pressure and difficulty breathing. That said, the real-world evidence that’s available so far suggests BA.2, like BA.1, tends to cause less severe illness. Some of that has to do with vaccination, which significantly decreases the odds of getting really sick. (About 65% of the total U.S. population is now fully vaccinated.) So health officials are cautiously optimistic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, has predicted that while the new omicron subvariant may cause a jump in cases here in the U.S., hospitalizations aren’t likely to soar. He pointed to the U.K., which recently experienced a surge in cases, but not a surge in severe illness. When doctors use the term “mild” to describe illness, they are basically saying it wasn’t serious enough that the infected person required hospitalization. So you could be experiencing “mild” symptoms of BA.2 that render you incapable of doing much of anything for days or weeks. You could feel pretty terrible, really. There’s also a chance that even a mild case of COVID-19 can lead to long COVID. As Carl Lambert Jr., a Chicago-based family physician, previously told HuffPost, “The big question is whether or not you’re able to recuperate at home.” If you can — even if you feel really crummy — you’ve still got what most doctors would consider a “mild” case. While health officials are hopeful we’re not on the cusp of a surge of serious illness, it is still important to take a COVID-19 test if you have any symptoms. That is true even if you are already vaccinated and boosted, and even if you recently recovered from COVID-19. It is unlikely that you would get BA.1 and BA.2 in short succession (experts tend to think you’re well protected for at least 90 days), but reinfection can happen. “If you have symptoms, you should test,” Lighter urged. “If you’re going to have an intimate dinner with someone who is significantly immune compromised, it’s a good idea to test before if it’s prevalent in your region. It’s all about gauging the risk.” Again, one of the reasons why experts are hopeful that BA.2 won’t cause a huge spike in hospitalizations and deaths — even as most places around the country have dropped mask mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions — is because so many people are now vaccinated. It is important to stay on top of recommendations, because they have been changing. This week, for example, the Food and Drug Administration authorized a second booster for adults 50 and older. Some doctors and researchers believe kids age 5 to 11 might need a booster soon, too. So make sure you work with your provider, get up to date on your shots, and pay attention to community transmission levels. “As long as people follow the current guidance and remain up to date from where they are right now, that’s the best thing they can do,” Johnson said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

7,China Launches Its Most Extensive COVID-19 Lockdown In 2 Years,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — China began its most extensive lockdown in two years Monday to conduct mass testing and control a growing outbreak in Shanghai as questions are raised about the economic toll of the nation’s “zero-COVID” strategy. China’s financial capital and largest city with 26 million people, Shanghai had managed its smaller, past outbreaks with limited lockdowns of housing compounds and workplaces where the virus was spreading. But the citywide lockdown that will be conducted in two phases will be China’s most extensive since the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late 2019, first confined its 11 million people to their homes for 76 days in early 2020. Millions more have been kept in lockdown since then. Shanghai’s Pudong financial district and nearby areas will be locked down from Monday to Friday as mass testing gets underway, the local government said. In the second phase of the lockdown, the vast downtown area west of the Huangpu River that divides the city will start its own five-day lockdown Friday. Residents will be required to stay home and deliveries will be left at checkpoints to ensure there is no contact with the outside world. Offices and all businesses not considered essential will be closed and public transport suspended. Already, many communities within Shanghai have been locked down for the past week, with their housing compounds blocked off with blue and yellow plastic barriers and residents required to submit to multiple tests for COVID-19. Shanghai’s Disneyland theme park is among the businesses that closed earlier. Automaker Tesla is also suspending production at its Shanghai plant, according to media reports. Panic-buying was reported on Sunday, with supermarket shelves cleared of food, beverages and household items. Additional barriers were being erected in neighborhoods Monday, with workers in hazmat suits staffing checkpoints. In-person observations of the April 5 Tomb Sweeping Festival have been canceled and memorials will instead be held online. Some workers, including traders at the city’s stock market, were preparing to stay within a COVID-19 “bubble” for the duration of the lockdown. Li Jiamin, 31, who works in the finance industry, said she had packed several days of clothing and supplies, and her company was sorting out sleeping and eating arrangements. “The overall impact is still great,” Li told The Associated Press, pointing especially to losses suffered by workers in the informal sector who have no such support. Huang Qi, 35, who works at a local university, said he had undergone a lockdown at home before and prepared for the new round by stocking up. “I think if the closure continues like this, our school workers will not be affected much, but what about those who work in the real economy? How can their business be maintained?” Huang said. “I still hope that our society can find a better balance between ensuring normal life and epidemic prevention and control,” Huang added. Shanghai detected another 3,500 cases of infection on Sunday, though all but 50 were people who tested positive for the coronavirus but were not showing symptoms of COVID-19. While people who are asymptomatic can still infect others, China categorizes such cases separately from “confirmed cases” — those in people who are sick — leading to much lower totals in daily reports. Nationwide, 1,219 new confirmed cases of domestic infection were detected on Sunday, more than 1,000 of them in the northeastern province of Jilin, along with 4,996 asymptomatic cases, the National Health Commission reported on Monday. China has reported more than 56,000 confirmed cases nationwide this month, with the surge in Jilin accounting for most of them. Jilin province is enforcing travel bans and partial lockdowns in several cities, including Changchun, one of the centers of the Chinese auto industry. Although the province has seen more than 1,000 new confirmed cases per day, prevention and control measures taken there do not appear to have been as extreme as in other places. As has become customary, Jilin has been building pre-fabricated temporary wards to house COVID-19 patients and those under observation as suspected cases. The city of Suzhou, about an hour from Shanghai, as well as Changsha in the country’s center and Shenyang in the northeast are also erecting such structures capable of housing more than 6,000 people. Shanghai itself has converted two gymnasiums, an exhibition hall and other facilities to house potential infected patients. China has called its long-standing “zero-tolerance” approach the most economical and effective prevention strategy against COVID-19. The new measures being enforced in Shanghai aim to “curb the virus spread, protect people’s life and health, and achieve the dynamic zero-COVID target as soon as possible,” the city’s COVID-19 prevention and control office stated in an announcement Sunday evening. That requires lockdowns and mass testing, with close contacts often being quarantined at home or in a central government facility. The strategy focuses on eradicating community transmission of the virus as quickly as possible. While officials, including Communist Party leader Xi Jinping have encouraged more targeted measures, local officials tend to take a more extreme approach, concerned with being fired or otherwise punished over accusations of failing to prevent outbreaks. Most recently, Hunan province, which has seen relatively few cases, ordered punishments against 19 officials for “failure to vigorously consolidate anti-pandemic policies,” state broadcaster CCTV reported Monday. With China’s economic growth already slowing, the extreme measures are seen as worsening difficulties hitting employment, consumption and even global supply chains. With a 21-day curfew in place for all foreigners arriving from abroad, travel between China and other countries has fallen dramatically. On Friday, the International Air Transport Association announced it was moving its annual general meeting from Shanghai to Doha, citing “continuing COVID-19 related restrictions on travel to China.” “It is deeply disappointing that we are not able to meet in Shanghai as planned,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said in a news release. Still, Shanghai’s announcement of the dates when the two lockdowns would be lifted appeared to show a further refinement in China’s approach. Previous citywide lockdowns had been open-ended. Although China’s vaccination rate is around 87%, it is considerably lower among older people who are more likely to become seriously ill if they contract the virus. In Hong Kong, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the government was still considering next steps in what has been criticized as a halting response to a recent fifth wave of COVID-19 infections that has led to tens of thousands of cases and more than 7,000 deaths. Lam said no decision has been made on whether or when to test all 7.4 million residents of the southern Chinese semi-autonomous region. “I don’t have a timetable yet. It’s not easy to predetermine a timetable, in the same way that I don’t know how quickly the cases will come down,” Lam told reporters at a daily briefing. ___ Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed to this story from Shanghai, China."

9,What It’s Like To Be A Stripper In Florida During COVID,coronavirus," March 25, 2022 TAMPA, Fla. — “I was just dancing and I leaned over, and all of a sudden I feel a lick,” said Nikki with a disgusted look on her face as she wiped her butt cheek with alcohol. Nikki is a stripper at the Penthouse Club in Tampa, Florida, and that September night, the club was packed with football fans celebrating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ victory against the Dallas Cowboys, despite the state being, at the time, in the midst of its worst wave of COVID yet. When Nikki worked, she always made sure to clean the pole carefully before performing and sanitized her hands constantly, but there was nothing she could do to prevent the occasional unwanted contact from clients. Working in the service industry during a pandemic is scary enough, but intimacy, feigned or not, is a key part of the job for strippers. “This is our 9-to-5,” Marley, another stripper at Penthouse, told me. “It’s not that I necessarily feel safe or comfortable allowing people to be in range. This is how we make a living.” Tampa is famous for its strip clubs, with residents often liking to brag that it’s the strip club capital of the world (however, the claim has been proven to be false). Though all strip clubs and other nonessential establishments closed in March 2020 for a three-month shutdown, the strip club industry has since benefited from the state’s lax COVID rules. (Throughout this piece, HuffPost used stage names to protect strippers’ privacy.) In May 2021, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) issued an executive order invalidating all existing local COVID restrictions. He’s even credited the lack of restrictions as a crucial part of the recovery of the tourism industry. “While other states were closed, VISIT FLORIDA invited travelers from all over the country to experience the magic and freedom of a Florida vacation,” boasted the state’s tourism body in October. But that freedom may have come at a cost. In late October, Florida finally emerged from its deadliest wave of COVID so far, during which it logged more infections, hospitalizations and deaths over the summer than at any point since the pandemic began. In August, it reached 25,000 average daily cases and 445 average daily deaths, giving the state the country’s highest death rate during the nationwide spike driven by the delta variant. More than 50,000 people in Florida have died from the virus in total. Despite these disturbing statistics, DeSantis issued an executive order in July banning mask mandates in schools and threatened to fine cities and counties for imposing vaccine mandates. In a press conference in September, DeSantis said people’s decision to get vaccinated “doesn’t impact me or anyone else,” though the state’s inadequate vaccination rates, at 58.2%, in conjunction with the contagious delta variant, have been blamed for the deadly surge. As other states’ strip clubs stayed shut, strippers flocked to the Sunshine State to be able to keep working. “We had lots of entertainers move temporarily to Florida because that was the only place they could continue to make money,” said Caroline Kirkendoll, the president of Penthouse Global Licensing, which licenses the Penthouse brand to strip clubs around the world. “There was almost a surplus of employees.” Penthouse dancer Johanna had flown in from New Orleans just a few days before I spoke to her. She was accustomed to wearing masks in New Orleans, and she said it was “a bit weird to not wear masks” inside the club. “I’ve got mine but then I realized no one was wearing it,” she said. Stephanie, another dancer, told me she didn’t wear masks because “I always felt like I’d be judged for believing COVID was a real thing.” “It felt like it would make me less money for wearing a mask,” she said. As long as the vast majority of patrons and colleagues weren’t wearing masks, strippers who might have preferred to wear them felt pressured to go maskless. Joe Redner, “Tampa’s Strip Club King” and the self-proclaimed “father of the nude lap dance,” founded Mons Venus, the city’s most iconic strip club, almost 40 years ago. He felt like his hands were tied as a business owner. Unless the government itself imposes mask policies or vaccine mandates, he believes that his clients and dancers would flock to other strip clubs if he tried to make either mandatory. “It needs to be a level playing field,” he said. Now in his 80s, Redner has battled the city council’s attempts to regulate the strip club industry, taken his case on growing his own weed to the Florida Supreme Court and run for mayor. But he told me there’s one thing he’s not proud of: not firing any of his workers for refusing to get vaccinated. “I don’t feel safe in my own club,” he told me. “I don’t understand why it doesn’t bother people here. Don’t they read the news?” In the strip club industry, dancers are independent workers who work for tips. While Mons Venus’ dancers come and go as they please, some clubs, like Penthouse, charge strippers a “house fee” to be able to perform. Kirkendoll said Penthouse had tried to incentivize dancers to get vaccinated by offering to waive house fees for two weeks. But most of the strippers I spoke to didn’t see the point in getting vaccinated. Some felt like they were young and healthy and therefore didn’t need it. “I don’t get the flu shot so I won’t get the COVID shot,” said Luna, a Penthouse stripper. “The second I get sick, I juice, I go to the gym.” Others felt like the vaccine wasn’t proven to be safe enough. “Until it’s something we have solid proof on, I’m not doing it,” said Penthouse dancer Marley. “It’s not that I want to harm anyone, but if anyone feels they’re at risk or have underlying issues, then you should probably not be here.” Despite the state’s lack of measures and the strip club industry’s generally freewheeling culture, a few strippers stood out for insisting on protecting themselves the best they could. Mons Venus stripper Bella is a cancer survivor. At the beginning of the pandemic, she wore not only a mask but also goggles. Now that she’s vaccinated, she still wears a mask while performing. “It sometimes feels awkward,” she said. “People laugh at me for wearing a mask, especially the younger kids who see things as a joke and say, ‘I’m not going to throw money at you because you have that mask on.’” But with two young children at home and a 98-year-old grandmother to think about, she feels it’s worth forgoing a little income: “Just for money? Money can’t buy happiness.” Nyx, a stripper at Déjà Vu, another Tampa club, also dances with a mask on and is fully vaccinated. She never takes her mask off, even when patrons ask her to. When they get in her face, she tries to turn the other way. And when she takes them back to a private booth for a lap dance, she makes them sanitize their hands. “With anything, you have to weigh out the risks and benefits,” she explained. “As for my livelihood, this is crucial for me.” Love, another dancer at Déjà Vu, had stopped dancing and moved to webcam work until she got vaccinated. She’s now returned to the stage, opting for Déjà Vu because the spacious venue seemed better ventilated than others. “It’s still scary,” she said. “I’m going to get the booster.” Marcos Figueroa, the general manager at Déjà Vu, said he’s trying everything he can to keep the club safe for everyone. “We don’t want to get a bad rap, we already got one because of the business we’re in,” he said. The club has even made its own bottles of alcohol spray, called “Cooty Killer.” “We want to show that we are really trying to look out for everyone.” Despite the risks posed by the pandemic, clients seemed eager to return to the city’s strip clubs. Figueroa says the club is making at least as much money, if not more, than it was prior the statewide shutdown that began in March 2020: “They have nowhere to go, they have no vices, and they know we provide a quality show.” Story Editor: Erin E.

1,IRS Says It Caught COVID-19 Relief Scammers Stealing A Total Of Nearly $2 Billion,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The IRS said it caught scammers who stole more than $1.8 billion from federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to help small businesses and workers affected by the pandemic. The massive amount of theft was uncovered over two years by IRS criminal investigations into more than 660 tax and money-laundering cases involving stimulus funds doled out as loans, credits and payments, the IRS said Wednesday. The total amount stolen from the federal government’s $2 trillion in pandemic aid may be many times higher. Back in December, the U.S. Secret Service estimated that at least $100 billion had been stolen from COVID-19 relief programs, mostly from unemployment fraud. That figure did not include cases like those uncovered by the IRS and prosecuted by the Justice Department. “Unfortunately, even during times of crisis, criminals pop their heads out to look for ways to take advantage of those in their most vulnerable state,” Jim Lee, chief of IRS criminal investigations, said in a statement. The IRS said it has had a 100% conviction rate for scammers who have been prosecuted, with prison sentences averaging 42 months. The fraud involved money appropriated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES, signed into law two years ago in response to the pandemic. The measure authorized more than $2 trillion in aid. Many of those the IRS caught scamming submitted fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications that cited fake businesses and employees. Some were accused of using the taxpayer money for lavish spending sprees, purchasing luxuries like Lamborghinis, Rolex watches, designer handbags and houses. After coming under suspicion, others attempted to fake their own death or flee the country. The Justice Department’s criminal division last month reported recovering more than $75 million in cash plundered from PPP funds, as well as real estate and luxury items purchased with fraudulent proceeds. The valuables were seized in cases involving more than 150 defendants in 95 criminal cases. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Howard Stern Gives 'Wacko Party' Trump Fans A Brutal Election Reality Check,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost The Republican Party has morphed into something completely different since former President Donald Trump took control, radio icon Howard Stern said. “The whole Republican Party’s gone bonkers,” Stern said Wednesday on his SiriusXM radio show, according to The Hill. Stern also described the GOP as the “wacko party.” “There’s so many wackos. I miss the old Republican Party. It used to be nice to have a two-party system,” he said. Stern then tore into the “wackos” for resisting masks and refusing to get vaccinated during the global coronavirus pandemic. “I hate to say it, but only 65 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, and I can’t help but think the wackos are winning,” he said. Stern also gave Republicans who believe Trump’s “big lie” about the 2020 election a reality check. Trump has claimed the election, which he lost, was rigged. Stern agreed, just not in the way the former president thinks. The rigging, according to Stern, is the Electoral College system, which allows someone to lose the popular vote as Trump did in 2016 and still become president. “The stupidity of the way we have our voting set up. The system was rigged — Trump’s right. It was rigged in his favor,” he said. “It was absolutely absurd that this guy got to be the president of the United States.” Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

4,Will 5- To 11-Year-Olds Need COVID Boosters?,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost It has been roughly five months since the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was approved for children ages 5 to 11, and for kids in that age group, two shots are all that is recommended right now. But in January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said older kids (age 12 and up) should get a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine if it has been five months since their second shot. So could boosters be coming for younger kids, too? Especially those who were vaccinated early on? Here’s what we know so far: “It is very likely that kids 5-11 will need a booster,” said Dr. Paul Spearman, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (which is conducting multiple clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines). Spearman pointed to new data showing the Pfizer vaccine was not nearly as effective in preventing infection among vaccinated 5- to-11-year-olds during the recent omicron surge (although it did continue to protect against severe illness) — data that certainly raises questions about whether a booster would increase protection. “Pfizer is studying booster doses in this age group, so we have to stay tuned to know how well the additional dose boosts vaccine responses,” Spearman said. “The answer may also depend upon what variants arise, but in general it is likely that a booster will be recommended at some point for this age group.” Dr. Dane Snyder, section chief of primary care pediatrics at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, hedged a bit more, saying it’s probably too soon to know whether younger children will require COVID-19 boosters — or when. Fewer young children are being followed in the research right now compared to adults and adolescents, and they weren’t eligible for the vaccine until last fall. All of that makes it more challenging to draw broad conclusions, Snyder said. Still, he too said the recent data on COVID-19 vaccines among young kids with regard to the omicron variant raises real questions about whether a booster would help. “While the primary vaccines have been effective in this group, the effectiveness may be lower than what we have seen in older children and adolescents who received a larger dose,” Snyder said. “That may indicate that a booster will be beneficial, but more information is still needed to make a recommendation one way or another.” The CDC already recommends that children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get a third COVID-19 vaccine dose 28 days after their second shot. That includes (but isn’t limited to) children with cancer or those who have had organ transplants. It is important to keep in mind that an additional dose and a booster are not the same thing from a clinical perspective. A booster is given to an otherwise healthy person who has completed their vaccine series, but who is believed to have had the expected immune response after their initial shots. For children with weakened immune systems, the additional dose is considered part of their primary COVID-19 vaccine series. All three doses they receive are smaller than those given to adolescents and adults. There’s a reason the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in children have rolled out by age: Physiologically speaking, kids aren’t simply smaller adults, and younger kids aren’t just miniature adolescents. A 5-year-old is different from a 15-year-old not just because the teenager likely weighs more and is significantly taller; they have different heart rates and breathing rates. Their hormones behave differently. Their immune systems function in distinct ways. That is why younger children receive a smaller dose than older children and adults. And it explains why public health officials and health care providers won’t start recommending boosters for 5- to 11-year-olds simply because they’re now recommended for adolescents and teens. “We know that boosters in older adolescents do what we hoped they would do ― the booster does improve vaccine effectiveness,” said Snyder. “And we know that two vaccines does reduce the risk of infection and severe illness in the 5- to 11-year group, even in the midst of the omicron variant. But each age group needs its own research and information about boosters.” While clinical trials are underway to determine whether boosters will eventually be recommended for 5- to 11-year-olds, pediatric health experts’ primary focus is getting more children their initial two shots. Uptake has been slower than health officials hoped for. Some 33% of 5- to 11-year-olds in the United States have received one dose of the vaccine at this point; 27% have received both. Parents and caregivers should speak with their child’s pediatrician or another trusted health expert if they have any concerns. But they should also understand that millions of children have now safely rolled up their sleeves. “I think parents should first be aware that these vaccines are extremely safe, and even those rare vaccine-related events like myocarditis are much less common in younger children,” Spearman said. “They are also quite effective, and although omicron lowered overall efficacy rates, we have to remember that the most important measure of protection is against severe disease, hospitalization and death. Current vaccines do very well in this important measure.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

6,Hillary Clinton Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Hillary Clinton has tested positive for COVID-19, she announced Tuesday on Twitter. The former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate said she has “mild cold symptoms but is otherwise “feeling fine,” adding she’s grateful for the protection from the COVID-19 vaccine. Well, I've tested positive for COVID. I've got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine. I'm more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already! Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has tested negative and has no symptoms, she added. The diagnosis for Hillary Clinton, 74, is the latest in a flurry of cases among high-profile politicians and other Washington figures. Her announcement comes just over a week after former President Barack Obama, whom she vied against for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, announced he’d tested positive for the virus. He also reported mild symptoms and said this should serve as “a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down.” Earlier on Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she, too, had tested positive for COVID-19, as had second gentleman Doug Emhoff last week. New cases and hospitalizations are down across the country after a winter surge in the omicron variant, but the U.S. is expected to soon surpass 1 million deaths from the virus. Only 65% of the population has been fully vaccinated, and a mere 29% have received a booster dose despite urging by public health officials.

7,White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that she is positive again for COVID-19 and will not accompany President Joe Biden to Europe for meetings on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden tested negative on Tuesday, she said. Psaki tweeted that she took a laboratory test for COVID-19 in preparation for the trip, which gets underway on Wednesday, and was later notified of a positive result. She said she had two “socially distanced meetings” with Biden on Monday and that he is not considered a “close contact” under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said she shared the news “out of an abundance of transparency.” Today, in preparation for travel to Europe, I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the President’s trip to Europe. I had two socially-distanced meetings with the President yesterday, and he is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an abundance of transparency. The President tested negative today via PCR test. Psaki tweeted and released a statement a short time before she was scheduled to step into the White House press room for her daily briefing, accompanied by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who was joining her to discuss the trip. After a brief delay, Chris Meagher, a deputy press secretary, introduced Sullivan to a waiting White House press corps and he proceeded with the briefing. Psaki said she will follow CDC guidance and no longer accompany Biden on his stops in Belgium, for a series of meetings with European leaders on Russia’s war in Ukraine, and in Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine and has taken in millions of Ukrainians fleeing warfare. Psaki said she has only experienced mild symptoms and credited being vaccinated against COVID-19. She said under White House COVID-19 protocols, she will work from home and plan to return to work at the end of a five-day isolation period and a negative test. This is the second time that COVID-19 has forced Psaki to bow out of accompanying Biden abroad. She sat out last fall’s trip to Rome and Glasgow, Scotland, after disclosing she had tested positive.

9,Long COVID Survivors Share How Their Lives Have Changed 2 Years Later,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost It’s been exactly two years since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, and yet many of those first infected with the virus continue to wonder if they’ll ever feel normal again. There have been an estimated 23.5 million cases of so-called long COVID in the U.S. since the pandemic began, with recent studies finding that up to 30% of those with COVID-19 will develop symptoms that last four weeks or more. These long COVID symptoms vary widely, with the virus today known to not just cause respiratory symptoms but also have effects on multiple organ systems, such as the kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal tract, heart and brain. Why some people may develop long-term symptoms while others may stay asymptomatic or recover quickly is not entirely clear. It also remains unknown whether any issues ― such as neurological damage that’s believed to be triggered by an overactive immune response ― will resolve with time or lead to a more persistent or chronic disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. “I really wonder if some of these things are going to be with me for the rest of my life,” said Stephanie Joyner, 54, who has been battling the effects of her COVID infection since early 2020. Joyner was one of four long COVID survivors who spoke with HuffPost in October 2020 about her ongoing battle. Here are some of their stories, two years after infection. Lat was hospitalized for 17 days in March 2020 ― six of those days were on a ventilator. Today he mostly feels back to his old self, though with a “greater appreciation for life.” Lat considers himself “very lucky,” twice over. He not only survived being hospitalized with COVID-19, an experience that left him on a ventilator and barely able to walk, but he has also overcome a yearlong battle with long COVID with few lasting health effects from it. “I consider myself very lucky when I read the accounts of people struggling with long COVID. I don’t have brain fog or fatigue or many of the other issues that are affecting so many,” he said. “The one thing I would say that I still have is my heart rate gets very high during exercise, higher than I think it used to pre-COVID, but that has been slowly and steadily improving.” “I didn't really think I could come this close to death as I did a few years ago.” The former lawyer, now a legal writer, had been able to run for miles with no problems before infection. Now he still cannot run as long and as fast as he could before. Though his heart rate has improved ― with a cardiologist last May scrapping plans to put him on beta blockers to help lower it after seeing improvement ― he says his lungs have not completely recovered. He still uses an inhaler prescribed for him after his COVID infection, but instead of using the “maintenance” one every day, he now only uses a “rescue” one before exercising. “I don’t know if they’ll ever be exactly the way they were before,” he said of his lungs, “but again, I feel very lucky that I can exercise again, not pre-COVID, but I can go about my day and work and I don’t have any problems.” Mentally, he no longer worries about getting sick as he did before. He is fully vaccinated and got a booster shot in November. In February he said a test found that his antibodies “were literally off the charts,” giving him confidence that he’d be able to fight off illness if infected again. The entire experience has also “given me a sense of the fragility of life,” he said. “Being a relatively young, relatively healthy person, I didn’t really think I could come this close to death as I did a few years ago, so I think it’s just given me a greater appreciation for life. My thoughts are with all the people who are still struggling with the effects of long COVID. Hopefully the pandemic will be behind us at some point, but I suspect there will be millions of people who will have aftereffects for years.” The former Maryland high school science teacher continues to endure long COVID health issues but sees progress in her recovery. She is currently working abroad, where she feels safer from re-infection. It’s been a whirlwind two years for Joyner. The high school science teacher and cross-country coach has gone from fearing she was on her COVID deathbed to getting laid off from teaching biology in Maryland and then to abruptly moving to Dubai last August as part of a two-year teaching contract. “Getting sacked ended up being the right thing at the right time,” she said of her last-minute decision to “pull the ripcord” and fulfill a longtime goal of teaching overseas. “I considered seeking new employment in Maryland and was like, but I won’t be safe, and I know I’ll be safer in another country.” Joyner said she continues to endure a number of health issues from long COVID, including a more fragile immune system and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been documented in other COVID survivors. But she’s found a haven in teaching in the United Arab Emirates, she said. The country only recently began to roll back some of its mask requirements, and nearly 100% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., the full vaccination rate is 66%. “In Maryland, just a few days ago, they said no more masks in schools. That, to me, is terrifying. I know the day will come, but I prefer our gradual rollout,” she said of the UAE’s handling of the pandemic, which she said has given her peace of mind. Joyner also says she feels safer due to the inaccessibility of guns in the country. She didn’t realize it until leaving, but the shooter lockdown drills she endured as a teacher in the U.S. also gave her PTSD. It was like “being away from an abusive relationship,” she said. “We had to redefine almost every aspect of our lives,” she said of those living with long COVID. “And for me, a big part of that was literally moving halfway around the world in order to feel safe.” Joyner’s long COVID symptoms today ― some of which she’s had since the start of her illness ― include neuropathy in her hands, disrupted sleep, body temperature fluctuations and photosensitivity. There have also been changes to her digestive tract, so she’s no longer able to eat dairy, processed sugar or gluten. Her eyeglass prescription changed as well, something she said her optometrist in Maryland said occurred in all of his patients who had COVID. She’s also lost a lot of stamina and needs to use an inhaler before going on runs. “I had to mourn the person I was before COVID, and I had to accept the fact that I may never be at that place again physically. That doesn’t mean I’m not going to keep trying. I have to keep trying. That’s actually the key to my sanity: to keep trying.” She’s also said she’s no longer taking anyone’s crap. “Surviving COVID, it was like I finally got permission to put myself first, for the first time in my life.” “I’m a better advocate for myself than I’ve ever been in my life. Surviving COVID, it was like I finally got permission to put myself first, for the first time in my life,” she said of her attitude today. As for the future, Joyner said she has “a hunch” that a lot of her “long-COVID souvenirs” are going to stay with her for the rest of her life. But if that’s the case, “that’s OK because I’ve made other gains.” “We all had those times during our illness where we weren’t sure if we were going to make it,” she said while fighting back tears. “And you know what? Even with neuropathy in these hands and temperature dysregulation and all this other wacko shit I deal with, I’m still here, damn it, and I’m living in another country, and I’m seeing all kinds of cool shit, and I drive on the highway and I see camels,” she said, laughing. “It’s been a great experience,” she said of her move to Dubai. “There have been challenges, of course, but that’s life and I’m living it.” The mother of two has continued to experience an irregular heartbeat and fatigue, as well as issues with her thyroid and autoimmune system. She continues to undergo testing. Long’s recovery from long COVID continues to hold a lot of mysteries. Doctors had been unable to find anything wrong with the former runner when we spoke with her in 2020, despite her routinely experiencing extreme exhaustion, heart palpitations and an inability to exercise. Curiously, the moment she started to feel better last summer was when she said doctors started to find issues. “There really wasn’t any reason to it that I could make sense of,” she said of her feeling of improvement, which misaligned with her medical tests. Her annual physical in July 2020 ― four months after contracting COVID-19 ― determined that her heart and lungs were actually healthier than they were a year prior. In contrast, she said a physical in July 2021 uncovered red flags. She had an irregular heartbeat, called sinus arrhythmia, in which the heart beats either too fast or too slow. She also had developed hyperthyroidism, which can accelerate metabolism and cause irregular heartbeat and weight loss, according to the Mayo Clinic. It was also suspected that she had developed the autoimmune disease Hashimoto’s, which studies suggest can be triggered by COVID-19. With her doctor’s referral she went to the Mayo Clinic’s cardiology department in Arizona for further testing. Last December, those tests concluded that she had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system, the part that regulates heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and body temperature, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. It can cause headaches, fatigue, brain fog, insomnia and difficulty thinking or concentrating, and, like Hashimoto’s, experts believe it can be triggered by COVID-19. Long said she feels POTS effects mostly in her heart, which jumps to about 50 beats per minute (bpm) when she stands. “I’m able to take longer walks than I could in October 2020, but I’m not really able to exercise at all aside from walking and yoga,” she said. “Any sort of jumping makes my heart rate spike, and my walking heart rate is still pretty high for me [120-130 bpm], especially considering I used to run half marathons and now I’m walking at a 2.5 mile per hour pace.” Today, she said, she continues to have memory issues and now headaches every morning upon waking ― something that started in January. She has a daily “buzzing” sensation throughout her body, which she likened to being plugged into an electric guitar amplifier. Then there are weekly body tremors, a sensation that recently increased from once every month or so. A video she posted on Twitter earlier this month shows one of her hands quivering during one such episode. Among other symptoms, I now shake like this (bear with the poor quality, both the hand making the video and the hand being videoed were shaking). pic.twitter.com/XPZa3VmpJp “My hands are where it is the most noticeable when it happens. Sometimes it’s my arms as well,” she said. She said she has a brain MRI scheduled in April with the Mayo Clinic and will also meet with an endocrinologist about her thyroid. As for her two young sons, who she suspects caught the virus around the time she did, the oldest, Gage, 10, continues to have heart palpitations and occasional breathing issues, including a lingering cough. “For the last six months, he’s been doing breathing treatments like they do for kids with asthma, but it’s hit or miss if they help him day to day.” “I now know firsthand that in an instant life can change in so many ways, so I make an effort to practice gratitude every single day for where I am right now.” Long said she has largely adapted to long COVID’s effects on her and her family, but she remains hopeful that this won’t be permanent. “The dysfunction that happens on a regular basis has been happening for a while, so I’ve kind of adjusted my life around it. I’m still hopeful that doctors will figure this out and maybe someday I will enjoy pieces of my ‘old life’ again, but I’m not defined by it either way. I’ve done the best I can to make an enjoyable life in the current state I’m in, and I have good days and bad days ― mentally, physically and emotionally.” She said she keeps her focus on all the things she can do rather than what she can’t. There are times when it can be hard, but ultimately she gives thanks. “I now know firsthand that in an instant life can change in so many ways, so I make an effort to practice gratitude every single day for where I am right now,” she said. Reporter’s note: Jillian Reed, who was interviewed back in 2020 as part of our first long-COVID story, declined to be interviewed again as she continues her recovery.

0,Is There Any Way To Reduce Your Risk Of Long COVID If You Get Sick?,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Over the past two years, it’s become more and more difficult to dodge COVID-19, especially as the virus has mutated to become more contagious. We know that high-quality masks help and vaccination drastically reduces our odds of contracting the coronavirus and developing serious illness. But given the nature of extremely contagious respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, infectious disease specialists say that most of us will, at some point, get infected. And as the reality of living with endemic COVID sets in, many of us have grown increasingly concerned about getting long COVID if and when that infection occurs. Because doctors are still researching what causes long COVID in the first place, we don’t have any treatments specifically designed to prevent long COVID. As of now, the best way to prevent a lingering case of COVID — aside from not getting COVID in the first place — is to get vaccinated and start treatment as soon as possible if you do get sick. “Vaccination and possibly early use of oral antiviral drugs are the most tangible and science-based means to prevent long COVID,” said Richard Becker, an internal medicine physician at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine who is running the UC Health long COVID clinic. Because COVID is a relatively new disease that’s been around for only a couple of years, scientists don’t yet have a solid understanding of what causes long COVID or how to prevent it. Researchers who study long COVID generally agree that the lingering health effects people experience after their infection are caused by inflammation throughout the body. Others suspect that people with long-haul symptoms still have small amounts of virus in their bodies that may trigger all sorts of health issues, including fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, tremors and chest or joint pain. We also know that a lot of long COVID patients started out really sick with COVID. “Just by the nature of being really sick, a lot of patients will have lingering symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath,” said Jean Paul Higuero-Sevilla, a critical care physician at Yale Medicine who works in the facility’s Post-COVID-19 Recovery Program. We’re in the early stages of understanding long COVID, and as of now there isn’t a treatment specifically designed to prevent it. “Figuring out the path of physiology is going to be key to understanding, No. 1, what can be done perhaps to prevent long COVID, and, No. 2, to get us some leads on how to effectively treat long COVID, which currently we don’t really have,” said Sally Hodder, an infectious disease physician and the director of the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute at West Virginia University. The single most effective way to reduce your risk of long COVID is to avoid getting COVID in the first place. But as infectious disease specialists have told us, that is becoming harder to do as COVID becomes endemic. Remember: Endemic doesn’t mean the virus no longer causes harm, it just means that the harm it does cause is more manageable on a population level. As long as COVID is around, the risk of long COVID isn’t zero. The best tool to reduce your risk of developing long COVID is to get vaccinated. A study published in January found that vaccination marginally reduced a person’s chances of experiencing long-haul COVID-19. Another report from the United Kingdom found that two doses of a COVID vaccine was associated with a 41% decrease in the odds of reporting long COVID symptoms. Vaccination reduces your chance of getting COVID in the first place, and, based on this research, also appears to lessen the risk of long COVID, Hodder said. But keep in mind that few studies have been done on this so far. So, though this data is promising, more research is needed, Hodder added. There also have been reports of vaccinated people getting long COVID following a breakthrough case. If you’re at risk for developing severe disease, you’ll want to start treatment as soon as your first symptoms appear. Evidence has shown that the sicker a person gets with COVID, the higher their risk of it turning into a long COVID case. Quickly starting the treatments that help keep the infection from worsening may ultimately help reduce your risk of experiencing long-haul symptoms, according to Higuero-Sevilla. “If you get COVID, especially patients that have co-morbidities, they should talk to their doctor about whether they qualify for monoclonal antibodies or antivirals,” said Higuero-Sevilla, who advises his high-risk patients — including those with diabetes, obesity, heart disease and lung disease — to call him as soon as they schedule a test. The oral antivirals available to treat COVID should be started within five days of symptom onset. The monoclonal antibody infusion is designed to start within seven days. These medications arrest viral replication and reduce the amount of virus in your body. “Early diagnosis and treatment with oral antiviral medication or possibly polyclonal antibody may be particularly important for preventing long COVID. This may be the case even for infections producing mild or mild-to-moderate symptoms,” Becker said. Knowing that inflammation seems to be at the root of long COVID, you may wonder if over-the-counter anti-inflammatories can help with long-haul symptoms. According to Higuero-Sevilla, there really isn’t any data to suggest that this medication can cut one’s risk of long COVID. We also don’t know if prednisone or dexamethasone — two steroids used to lower inflammation in COVID patients — could affect one’s risk of long COVID, Becker added. Doctors recommend resting and staying hydrating if you do catch COVID. But whether these interventions will cut your risk of developing long COVID is unknown. That research is ongoing, Hodder said, and if you’d like to participate in studies on long COVID, you can by applying through the National Institutes of Health. Researchers are currently looking for a range of participants — people who’ve had COVID and didn’t get long COVID, people who developed long COVID and people who haven’t been infected — to get a better grasp on what causes long COVID so we can learn how to prevent it. “It’s going to take a while before we know more about it,” Higuero-Sevilla said. “We don’t have the answers yet.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,"The Pandemic Opened Up My World. As We 'Get Back To Normal,' I Fear I'll Disappear Again.",coronavirus," Guest Writer During the height of the pandemic, I went to a live concert with my husband. It was the first concert I had been to in over six years. We sat on our couch, a beer in his hand and a bowl of ice cream in mine, as the band’s music blasted through our smart TV. I lowered the thumping of the bass with the remote. I looked away when the pulsing lights flashed over the stage. There were no moving crowds to make me feel dizzy. My limited energy supply wasn’t drained by a commute to and from the venue. We were alone, but I still felt connected to something more universal ― a thread that bound me to others. This is what the pandemic gifted me. I realize this is not an ideal format to experience a live concert, but for me, it is the closest I can get, having joined the ranks of the invisibly disabled during my 40th year. One cold night, my right heel slipped on black ice and I was flipped into the air, my head landing on the crumbling concrete of our driveway. I was diagnosed with a concussion and told I would be better within two to three weeks. Fast forward six years, and I’m still dealing with the persistent symptoms of post-concussive syndrome. What this means is that my brain can’t process bright lights or multiple layers of noise. It means that my head spins when riding in a car or walking on a busy street. It means that I am unable to concentrate on a task for longer than an hour. Really, what this means is that I can barely leave my home without tailspinning into dizziness and migraines and neuro-fatigue that can last anywhere from hours to days. By the time COVID-19 had forced us all to shelter in place, I had already been living within the walls of my home for four years. But the pandemic made me feel like I was no longer stuck in my house; instead, I was wrapped within a collective grief. And I hate to confess this — knowing the suffering and loss this virus has caused for so many people — but my world opened when everyone else’s shut down. “More types of activities than ever imagined — cooking courses, church, conferences, yoga classes, support groups — allowed me to meet people within the quiet of my home, without the inevitable migraine or the fast depletion of my energy levels. For the first time in years, my social calendar was packed.” Telehealth appointments meant I no longer had to struggle with the florescent lights and background music in waiting rooms. For the first time since my accident, thanks to a streamed performance from the St. Louis Ballet, my daughter and I engaged in our previous tradition of seeing “The Nutcracker.” It became the norm to form small “pods” or groups, making social gatherings more accessible. Restaurants moved their tables outside, making noise levels more tolerable. I could easily attend birthday parties because they had been moved online. More types of activities than ever imagined — cooking courses, church, conferences, yoga classes, support groups — allowed me to meet people within the quiet of my home, without the inevitable migraine or the fast depletion of my energy levels. For the first time in years, my social calendar was packed. Colin Killick, the executive director of the Disability Policy Consortium, has said, “People with disabilities found that accommodations they were denied for decades suddenly became universally available during the pandemic.” I can only speak to living with my kind of invisible disability, but these adaptations have been life-altering, providing a sense of belonging when for so many years I felt nothing but isolation and abandonment. And there are so many of us. About 10% to 20% of concussed individuals will have symptoms that leave them suffering for months to years ― perhaps forever. More broadly, it has been estimated that up to 10% of Americans have a disability that is not easily detectable, many neurological in nature, like mine. Think: migraine, myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, fibromyalgia. Symptoms vary from person to person, but these neurological conditions often cause debilitating pain, headaches, fatigue, dizziness and cognitive impairments, to name a few. Let’s also not forget the newest group to join the invisibly disabled: those with long COVID. The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation notes that 10% to 30% of Americans who had COVID may have long COVID, with many suffering from invisible symptoms like “brain fog,” fatigue, and muscle and joint pain. Many have and will become stuck at home, unable to work — and, like many of us, find themselves cut off from the world. I know that the privileged population who had the luxury of being able to stay home (like me) or work from behind a computer are tired of blue light-emitting screens, Zoom-ed out, ready to eat in restaurants and get on with their lives. People are returning to work, buying tickets to social events, laughing at parties. But as the world returns to normal, I flash back to the first year after my concussion, when I lived in almost total seclusion within the dark walls of my bedroom. With shaken neurochemicals and existing only in isolation, my mind and health deteriorated. It has been reported that social isolation and loneliness are so dangerous that they have similar health effects to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. But the impacts go even further. After almost a year of separation, I got to the point where I no longer felt alive, my brain a gelatinous blob in a body that could still beat its heart. My thoughts became ravaged with suicidal ideation while I stared at the ceiling. I am not alone in this. According to a commentary published in the Journal of Health Science & Education, “rates of suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion are alarmingly high in chronic invisible illness communities.” Risk factors for suicide, such as sense of isolation, hopelessness, job loss, and loss of relationships, are widespread for those living with hidden disabilities. Twenty percent of people with myalgic encephalomyelitis die by suicide. For people diagnosed with fibromyalgia, 33% report suicidal ideation, and “1,200 chronic Lyme disease patients die by suicide in the United States annually.” A meta-analysis completed at Harvard found that concussion increased the risk of suicide twofold. Similarly, a group of Canadian researchers found that the suicide rate was three times the population norm for those with concussions, with 5.7 years being the mean time between a mild concussion and suicide. And for those suffering with long COVID, commentary in QJM has already raised red flags, noting that “inflammatory damage to the brain in individuals with post-COVID syndrome increase suicidal ideation and behavior in this patient population.” Most of us have now experienced first-hand the impacts of sheltering in place and lockdowns and the effects it has on our mental health. Like most of the population, I do not want to go back to these lockdowns. But the pandemic has shown us that more is possible, that we have the capabilities to adapt and bring ourselves together in new and innovative ways. For myself, I do not want to lose this. It’s critical to consider the vast populace who want to participate and contribute to our society but can’t due to something outside their control. After all, most of us will weave in and out of disability throughout our lifetimes, whether from an injury or an illness or the inescapable process of aging. “The pandemic has shown us that more is possible, that we have the capabilities to adapt and bring ourselves together in new and innovative ways.” In the long run, keeping the pandemic’s accommodations in place will benefit all of us. They mean getting an online appointment with a veterinarian when Cujo keeps ripping apart shoes but you can’t make it to the clinic. They mean joining a school board meeting remotely when work goes late. Maybe they can bring about the end of waiting in lines. I can’t help but think of Ed Roberts, who pioneered curb cuts — also known as the dropped curb — to assist wheelchair users, only to discover that it benefitted others as well, like people pushing strollers or riding bicycles or those with a cane. At the very least, keeping the accommodations we adopted during the pandemic will require that choices continue to exist with the aid of technology. I need my daughter’s piano lessons to still be conducted online because it is hard for me to drive there. I want live events to be streamed for those who can’t attend in person. I want health insurance to continue to cover telehealth appointments. I want remote work to still be available for those who need it. And I want us to think bigger, like having public areas such as airports and conference venues to include quiet and low-light places to rest. I want us to universally adopt a system like the sunflower lanyards in the U.K. or the National Disability ID in the United States, which allow people to discreetly signify that they may need support due to an invisible condition. The unfortunate consequence of having an invisible disability is that we often become invisible. COVID-19 has brought options that I never thought would be possible. The pandemic didn’t bring my former life back, but it has curtailed my loneliness and allowed me to belong again. And society benefits when the millions of people with invisible disabilities have a seat at the table. The livestreamed concert my husband and I watched eventually ended, the band gave its final encore, the stage lights went out. Most concerts are now for those who can attend in-person, but like many in the invisibly disabled community, I need the stage lights to stay on at home too.

2,Anthony Fauci Warns Of Possible Uptick In COVID Cases,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Just as COVID-19 restrictions are being relaxed across the nation as hospitalizations and deaths from the disease plummet, Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning that cases could soon be on the rise — again. Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, is concerned about current case increases in Europe, which usually predict a rise in the U.S. a short time later. “We’re still, as a country, going in the right direction with regard to the downward trajectory of cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” the infectious disease expert said on “PBS NewsHour” Thursday. (See the full interview in the video above.) But the “caveat about that is that we generally follow the European Union, but particularly the U.K., by ... usually three or so weeks” — and cases are currently on the uptick there, he noted. Relaxed COVID-19 restrictions in the U.K., combined with the increased transmissibility of the new BA.2 subvariant of the original omicron variant, are now pushing up the number of cases, Fauci warned. “I would not be surprised ... if in the next few weeks we do see an uptick in cases” in the U.S., he added. But the “really important issue” is if that will trigger a hike in severe disease that would lead to more hospitalizations and deaths, said Fauci. “We will have to ... wait and see,” he added, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is prepared to “pivot back” to old COVID-19 restrictions in the event of a surge. “But that is really unpredictable right now,” he added.

3,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Makes Her Most Ignorant Vaccine Claim Yet,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) again tried to attack vaccines, but the detail at the center of her argument was completely wrong. The conspiracy theorist and right-wing lawmaker, who last month was a key speaker at a white nationalist event, tried to blast coronavirus booster shots by comparing COVID-19 vaccines to other inoculations. “I have never seen the CDC coming out, saying, ’Oh you’ve got to get your second polio shot, you gotta get your third, you gotta get your fourth,” she said. The CDC has, in fact, said exactly that. The agency’s website explains that polio vaccination is a four-dose regimen and details when each shot should be given. Greene: I have never seen the CDC coming out and saying you’ve got to get your second Polio shot, you gotta get your third.. pic.twitter.com/KqXjvZpBFt “I think the question we all should ask is, ‘When does it stop and when are enough vaccines enough?’” she said. “But we don’t have that question.” Greene was stripped of her House committee assignments last year due to her history of violent rhetoric as well as antisemitic conspiracy theories. Since then, she has suggested a “national divorce,” said the Second Amendment could be a defense against Democrats and used racial slurs. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has punished Republicans who’ve spoken out against Trump, has taken no action against Greene. In fact, he has said she would regain her committee assignments if Republicans retake the House in this year’s midterm elections, and vowed to kick several Democrats out of their committees in retaliation.

4,Moderna Seeks FDA Authorization For A 2nd Booster Dose Of Its Coronavirus Vaccine,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Drugmaker Moderna asked the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to authorize a fourth shot of its COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for all adults. The request is broader than rival pharmaceutical company Pfizer’s request earlier this week for the regulator to approve a booster shot for all seniors. In a press release, the company said its request for approval for all adults was made “to provide flexibility” to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and medical providers to determine the “appropriate use” of a second booster dose of the mRNA vaccine, “including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities.” U.S. officials have been laying the groundwork to deliver additional booster doses to shore up the vaccines’ protection against serious disease and death from COVID-19. The White House has been sounding the alarm that it needs Congress to “urgently” approve more funding for the federal government to secure more doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, either for additional booster shots or variant-specific immunizations. U.S. health officials currently recommend a primary series of two doses of the Moderna vaccine and a booster dose months later. Moderna said its request for an additional dose was based on “recently published data generated in the United States and Israel following the emergence of Omicron.” On Tuesday, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech asked U.S. regulators to authorize an additional booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccine for seniors, saying data from Israel suggests older adults would benefit."

1,Omicron BA.2 Strain's Rise In Europe Has Clues For U.S.,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost As European nations continue to ease pandemic restrictions, COVID-19 cases are rising again due to the spread of a new coronavirus subvariant called omicron BA.2. That suggests the U.S. may soon face a surge. COVID-19 cases in the U.K. increased 48% the week of March 6 compared with the week before, while hospitalizations rose by 17%, according to CNN. Over the past seven days, 492,103 people tested positive, U.K. government data shows. Despite the increases, preliminary research shows BA.2 does not present a higher risk of hospitalization than the original omicron strain known as BA.1, the U.K. Health Security Agency said. U.S. public health experts are paying close attention. “If we’ve learned anything in this pandemic, it is that the trends in Europe precede our own,” Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told NBC News. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, attributed the rise in U.K. cases to three factors: the prevalence of BA.2, the relaxation of COVID-19 safety measures and waning immunity from vaccinations or past infections. “Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we’ve really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here,” Fauci told CNN. “So, that’s the reason why we’re watching this very carefully.” The U.K. has removed almost all public health precautions to limit the spread of the virus. An exception is Scotland, where mask rules in stores and public transport will stay in place until April because of the surge in cases. First Minister @NicolaSturgeon has confirmed the legal requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and most indoor public settings will continue until at least Monday 4 April. pic.twitter.com/7Y3odNUAQl Britain’s Heathrow Airport announced it would remove mask mandates for passengers starting today. Effective from Wednesday 16 March, we'll remove the requirement for wearing face coverings at the airport. We still strongly encourage both colleagues & passengers to wear them, particularly when they come into close contact with others, but this will no longer be mandatory. 1/2 “While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we’ve made in COVID-secure measures — some of which aren’t always visible — combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while traveling,” Heathrow’s chief operating officer Emma Gilthorpe told the BBC. Still, the so-called stealth omicron now dominates cases in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. According to the Office of National Statistics in the U.K., the BA.2 variant accounted for more than half of the cases sequenced during the week ended Feb. 27. COVID-19 cases linked to the BA.2 variant increased across the U.K. in the week ending March 5. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands also have seen jumps, according to data published by John Hopkins University. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new subvariant accounts for nearly a quarter of new cases, according to CBS. CDC wastewater surveillance data showed increased COVID-19 levels from March 1 to March 10, according to Bloomberg, although the agency’s COVID-19 data tracker shows that cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue their downward trend. “These bumps may simply reflect minor increase from very low levels to still-low levels,” Amy Kirby, head of the CDC’s wastewater monitoring program, told NBC News in a statement. Kirby cautioned that some parts of the country could see a further rise in cases due to the relaxation of COVID-19 measures. Dr. Deborah Dowell, chief medical officer of the CDC’s COVID-19 response, said BA.2 so far does not appear to be driving a big increase in U.S. cases. “Although BA.2 does seem to be growing as a proportion of sub-lineages in the United States, it’s not nearly as quickly as we’ve seen in some other countries,” Dowell told a webinar hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America over the weekend, according to CBS News. “The doubling time in the United States actually seems to be slowing down.” This latest stage of the pandemic is highlighting the difference between countries’ COVID strategies. China is still pursuing a “zero tolerance” approach, locking down cities as it battles its biggest outbreak since early 2020. European nations and the U.S. never set a goal of zero COVID, instead relying on vaccines and public health guidance. Congress last week passed a $1.5 trillion spending bill that did not grant the administration’s request for additional pandemic funding. In response, the White House told reporters Tuesday that the omission would leave the nation in a tough spot and would not allow the administration to offer booster shots for free to the entire population if that becomes recommended, according to CNN. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that a fourth shot would be “necessary” to prevent further infection. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Second gentleman Doug Emhoff has tested positive for COVID-19, the White House announced Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris tested negative, but is curtailing her schedule as a result of her husband’s positive test. Harris spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Harris would not participate in a planned Equal Pay Day event on Tuesday evening at the White House with President Joe Biden “out of an abundance of caution.” “The Vice President tested negative for COVID-19 today and will continue to test,” she said. Biden and Harris appeared together Tuesday afternoon and mingled with lawmakers at an event marking the signing of a $1.5 trillion government funding measure. Before Emhoff’s diagnosis was public, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden had tested negative for COVID-19 on Sunday. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Pfizer Expected To Seek Approval For Additional Booster Shot For Seniors,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Drugmaker Pfizer is expected to request authorization this week for an additional COVID-19 booster dose for seniors, according to a person familiar with the matter. It would add a fourth dose to the regimen, which currently consists of a primary series of two shots, followed months later by a booster dose, in an effort to provide maximum protection to the over-65 population that has been hit hardest by the pandemic. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control must approve the request. The person who spoke about the upcoming Pfizer authorization request spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak on the record. “We’re continuing to collect and assess all available data and we’re in continuous, open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a COVID-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves,” said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts. Speaking to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said, “Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a fourth booster right now. The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It’s not that good against infections, but doesn’t last very long. But we are just submitting those data to the FDA and then we will see what the experts also will say outside Pfizer.”"
4,I Was A COVID Doctor. Here's The One Thing I Refuse To Do As We 'Get Back To Normal.',coronavirus," Guest Writer I clocked out from my final COVID shift last week. For the past two years, I have done it all when it comes to the patients in our COVID inbox: screening for who gets tests when tests were rationed, triaging who should stay home when care was rationed, prioritizing who gets vaccines when vaccines were rationed, and deciding who gets treatments when treatments were rationed. Decisions made by those in power have affected every aspect of the health care we could offer, and the resultant toll on health care workers has been immeasurable. Health care workers are not OK. As the transition back to “normal” begins, our clinics — echoing the rest of the nation — are moving toward a new stage of the pandemic. A stage where the role of the COVID-19 care provider is dissolved and absorbed into the umbrella of primary care, where a collective problem gets shoved onto the individual, and where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our nation’s foremost health protection agency, places the burden of risk calculation onto millions of immunocompromised people by advising them to “talk to their health care provider” about masking and what measures they should take to stay safe. The CDC is essentially washing its hands of any policy-level responsibility to support or protect those who are most vulnerable. Never mind the millions of uninsured people who don’t have primary care providers. Never mind the fact that talking to your provider first requires overcoming the barriers of a visit and a copay. In other words, in place of guidelines, it’s “talk to your health care provider.” So we have moved on to the “live with it” part of the pandemic, even though more than 1,000 Americans a day are still in the “die with it” part of the pandemic. And with this push toward individual responsibility, we shift the burden onto individual clinics and onto already overstretched primary care clinicians who face the daunting task of trying to get antivirals to patients with COVID within the first five days of symptoms. It’s a task that can be achieved in well-staffed, patient-centered, functional health care systems. Ask your doctor whether we have one of those. “The reach of the powerful continues to do harm, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his recent mask tantrum in front of high school students, in which he accused them of COVID theatrics.” For two years, I have watched in horror as the people in charge of this country have presided over close to 1 million dead from COVID and counting, as charlatans and grifters occupy the halls of power. Never have I regretted so profoundly that I was not a person with influence, with a perch, pulpit, podium and power, like the morally barren have in abundance. I have wanted to amplify the voices of those who are most vulnerable because countless decisions have disregarded their lives — those who are the least powerful, the most at risk and the least represented. Over the last two years, the mediocrity displayed at the top of our political hierarchy has been a shock to the system. Rep. Matt Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor in the early days of the pandemic. It’s an image emblazoned in my memory. His mocking of a respiratory virus that would go on to kill millions worldwide set the tone for Donald Trump’s endless lies about everything from face masks to hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. These lies were then given a platform and amplified in an endless cycle by the likes of Tucker Carlson, the grotesque frozen fish heir masquerading as a journalist and others. The reach of the powerful continues to do harm, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his recent mask tantrum in front of high school students, in which he accused them of COVID theatrics. Casey DeSantis, his wife, was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent treatment during the pandemic. Cancer patients have increased risks of poor outcomes if they catch COVID, and having family members with cancer myself, I know all too well the bullets you have to dodge to keep them safe. Thus, I have watched in horror as Ron DeSantis has paraded around maskless with his adoring, sycophantic crowds, a more polished mirror image of Trump, nudging children at podiums to parrot anti-mask talking points. I have worried about Casey DeSantis every time I see Ron DeSantis at another presser, putting more lies out into the world about vaccines and masks ― making the world less safe for her and people like her. We have a saying in my culture: “Bhanela, pan ganela nahi,” which means “educated, but lacking sense.” Perhaps that applies in this case. But more than likely it is a choice, a choice to do whatever it takes to aggregate power — a thirst for power so acute, you are willing to make the world more dangerous for everyone, including your own wife. These thoughts were swirling in my mind as I reflected on the past two years with another doctor who had to fight to get basic safety protections for her and her colleagues during that first year of the pandemic. The feeling of powerlessness, the lack of agency and the sense that she was too small to change anything had transformed her deeply. The clear sense of her disposability and the overwhelming vulnerability of her position was a shock that made her turn inward and pivot to feeling that she could only care for “me and mine” and let everything else go. Her emotions were raw as we spoke, as if she were still reeling, startled at how powerless she was made to feel. I, too, felt like I had to take care of me and mine. But for me as an immunocompromised person, for better or for worse, my “mine” felt like it had expanded to 7 million people, a likely undercount of the total number of immunocompromised people in the United States. My “mine” had been told in a thousand ways, big and small, that we were disposable. The more I think about it, the more I feel like my “mine” has expanded to people over the age of 65, 1 out of 100 of whom have succumbed to COVID. Being older shouldn’t make you disposable, regardless of whether a windbag out of Texas advocated for seniors to sacrifice their lives for the economy, knowing full well his position and wealth would insulate him from any such sacrifice. My “mine” has expanded to all people of color, whose disproportionate death rates have made it clear who benefits from the policies in our country ― and whose lives matter in our society. My “mine” has expanded to kids, who have lost so much over the past two years but have gained so many alleged local well-wishers willing to be out in front when it came to unmasking them. Unsurprisingly, these supporters were nowhere to be found this past weekend at the rally against school closures in Oakland, California. These kids’ lives matter as long as they are political pawns for antimasking initiatives, but their mattering is conditional on who they love and what their gender identities are. As an immunocompromised doctor on my clinic’s COVID team for the past two years, I want everyone — especially our most vulnerable — to live and thrive through whatever this next period looks like. Everyone, especially the most at risk, deserves to have access to the antiviral Paxlovid as soon as they test positive for COVID. People who are severely immunocompromised should have access to Evusheld, the pre-exposure prophylaxis shot of monoclonal antibodies that can protect them from getting COVID in the first place. This should be available and accessible to all 7 million-plus immunocompromised Americans, and this should have been available before this push for “back to normal” was made. Instead, there is only enough for 850,000 people to be protected, and even that is not being distributed due to systemic dysfunction. “Clinicians don’t have the luxury of staying in our lane anymore after politicians have rammed their way into ours.” I have wanted a megaphone to drown out the voices of those who are educated but lack sense, educated but lack humanity, educated but lack decency, who didn’t seem to mind if their policies landed me in a body bag. So I am taking this moment, here and now, to say loud and clear that while there are many things I will be doing as we “get back to normal” ― including continuing to advocate for vaccine equity, pushing for access to therapeutics for everyone, pushing to prioritize the immunocompromised and most vulnerable in this effort to reopen ― there is one thing I refuse to do: stay in my own lane. Clinicians don’t have the luxury of staying in our lane anymore after politicians have rammed their way into ours. Politicians have inserted themselves into our clinic rooms, violating that sacred space between clinician and patient, and we must act and react accordingly. When COVID policies reflect a disregard for the lives of those most vulnerable of all ages, we must speak out and demand different policies. Just as we have to speak out when policies are put in place that threaten the lives of our LGBTQ+ youth ― kids whose lives are being upended by so-called leaders in states such as Texas, Idaho and Florida. Just as we have to speak out when forced birthers continue to threaten the lives of people and their bodily autonomy. We must continue to advocate for those who will be gravely affected by these policies and laws. We must push back when decisions are being made that undermine the health of our communities ― decisions that directly hurt our patients. Politicians and their policies shoved their way into our lane when we were forced to protect ourselves with trash bags, reusing limp N95 masks that we stored in brown paper lunch bags labeled with our names on them, shift after shift. Their actions and lack of actions have led us to nearly 1 million dead. These past two years have shown clinicians that staying in our narrow lane of old is no longer an option. If we care about the health and well being of all people, then in our lane, no lives are disposable. Dipti S. Barot is a primary care doctor and freelance writer in the San Francisco Bay Area.

5,Got Brain Fog Because Of Long COVID? Here's Why And How To Cope.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost If you’ve ever been jet-lagged or pulled an all-nighter before going straight into work or school, you probably know the feeling. Maybe you had a harder time focusing that day, were more irritable and forgetful than usual, or just felt mentally off. Brain fog, a term used to describe feelings of mental fuzziness, affects everyone differently. And while there are many health conditions known to cause brain fog, COVID-19 seems to have a unique and serious impact on some people’s ability to think clearly. Scientists are just beginning to understand how COVID affects the brain, but growing evidence shows that even mild to moderate coronavirus infections can cause brain damage and trigger problems with memory, concentration and executive functioning. In most cases, this brain fog resolves naturally within a matter of weeks, but some people develop chronic brain fog that persists for months, and maybe even years. Because COVID is still relatively new, we don’t yet know how long that brain fog is capable of lasting. Here’s what we know about COVID-related brain fog, and how to cope with it: There are many health conditions and infections known to cause brain fog. Sepsis causes inflammatory changes in the brain that affects cognitive function and attention, and brain fog is a telltale symptom of Lyme disease and cancer that’s being treated with chemotherapy (you may have heard of “chemo brain”). Even some people who contract influenza develop brain fog — something that’s been dubbed “flu brain.” There’s something unique about the brain fog that comes with COVID, according to James Giordano, a professor of neurology and biochemistry at Georgetown University Medical Center. With most of these other conditions, brain fog typically resolves when the infection clears or the treatment stops. COVID, however, seems to cause a much more intense and sometimes long-lasting, widespread inflammatory effect — and the brain fog can persist for weeks or months on end. The brain fog people experience with long COVID is most likely a result of direct and indirect inflammatory effects on the brain, Giordano said. We now know that COVID can, in some cases, trigger a massive inflammatory response that can cause a lot of tissue damage throughout the body. Evidence also suggests the coronavirus can directly infect cells in and around the brain, creating an inflammatory response in the brain itself. Plus, even when the infection clears, the inflammatory responses in and around the brain can persist and cause issues with cognition, behavior and functioning. There’s also a theory that the virus may continue to exist at very low levels in some patients and cause ongoing symptoms. Earlier in the pandemic, researchers suspected that long COVID was mostly a consequence of severe infections, but a study published in the journal Nature this month found that even mild to moderate cases of COVID can damage the brain and cause cognitive decline. “Now we are really seeing inflammatory changes in the brain, and those inflammatory changes disrupt the functional architecture of the way brain nodes and networks are operating to control certain aspects of cognition and behavior,” Giordano said. A COVID diagnosis does not mean you will definitely go on to experience brain fog. Many people will clear the infection and bounce back immediately. Some will gradually improve over time. In others, however, the brain fog persists — and occasionally, it can become chronic and debilitating. “That’s one of the really fascinating things about this virus: Each body that it goes into, it can affect so differently,” said Dr. Mill Etienne, an associate professor of neurology and medicine at New York Medical College. This makes it very hard to predict who will develop brain fog. Age seems to play a role, as older people are more at risk for experiencing cognitive issues after COVID, according to Giordano. But even some young, otherwise healthy people diagnosed with COVID have found themselves struggling with brain fog. “You don’t have to have a severe case of COVID in order to have this long COVID syndrome,” Etienne said. Giordano said the specific symptoms of brain fog also vary from person to person. Some people experience fatigue after the slightest level of physical or mental exertion. “It’s not just that they feel tired; they literally feel like they can’t do this anymore — in other words, they have to stop doing anything and just kind of rest,” Giordano said. Brain fog can also cause short-term memory problems and issues with multitasking. Certain people may find it more difficult to concentrate or stick with a task, and others will experience coordination problems or become emotionally labile. Sensory changes — like, most notably, sense of smell and taste — also fall under the umbrella of brain fog. Etienne, who routinely treats long COVID patients who have brain fog, said he has seen high-functioning adults suddenly struggle with multitasking and concentration. In severe cases, the brain fog can cost them their livelihoods, he added. “It’s not just that they feel tired; they literally feel like they can’t do this anymore — in other words, they have to stop doing anything and just kind of rest.” Most of the time, the brain fog will clear up naturally over time, Etienne said. But there are people who were infected early on in the coronavirus pandemic who continue, two years later, to experience brain fog. If you’ve been battling brain fog after COVID, try to acknowledge that you have it and recognize its impact on your daily functioning and quality of life, Giordano advised. Consult with a physician and be specific about what brain fog feels like to you. Doing so will help your doctor develop a tailored treatment plan that will help mitigate the specific effects you are experiencing. In certain instances, medications and anti-inflammatory drugs may be recommended. Though it can be difficult for people experiencing more moderate to severe cognitive symptoms, try to stay physically active and keep your brain active with recuperative mental tasks called cognitive crunches (think: playing games or making notes, lists and reminders). “If you don’t use it, you tend to lose it,” Giordano said. Some infectious disease experts recommend following an anti-inflammatory diet. Avoid fried foods, food high in saturated fat, and added sugars that cause inflammation. The Mediterranean diet, for example, is rich in antioxidants, which are known to mitigate inflammatory effects in the brain and body, Giordano said. Lastly, get adequate rest and stay hydrated. “People usually take those things for granted,” Giordano said, “but in this particular case, it’s rather important because both rest and hydration can be very recuperative to brain metabolism.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

6,"Moderna President Says 4th Vaccine Dose Beneficial, But Not Necessary For All",coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Moderna’s president said Monday that a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine will likely not be necessary for the general public, but encouraged it for older people and the immunocompromised — and said that an extra booster will “provide a benefit to anyone who gets it.” Stephen Hoge, who heads the vaccine-maker, told Business Insider that the company was “strongly” recommending and encouraging a fourth COVID shot for adults over the age of 50 or with compromised immune systems. But he hesitated to call a fourth dose “necessary.” “For those who are immune-compromised, those who are older adults, over the age of 50 or at least 65, we want to strongly recommend and encourage [a fourth shot], the same way we do with flu vaccines,” Hoge told the publication. “Is it necessary? I think that’s a strong word. I think it will provide a benefit to anyone who gets it.” Fourth doses of COVID-19 vaccines are already authorized for some people with compromised immune systems. A day earlier, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, had said a fourth dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine was “necessary” to prevent future coronavirus infections as the omicron variant continues to spread and after Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data found that booster shots lose a great amount of their effectiveness after four months. “The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good, for hospitalizations and deaths. It’s not that good against infections [and] doesn’t last very long,” Bourla said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “But we are just submitting those data to the FDA, and then we will see what the experts also will say outside Pfizer.” The Pfizer CEO added that his company was working on a vaccine that would provide immunity for at least a year, likening it to an annual flu shot, and added that the world will have “to learn how to live with [COVID-19] … as we are living with many — so many other viruses.” Moderna’s CEO, Hoge, told Business Insider that he personally planned to get a coronavirus booster every year, since he doesn’t want to lose his sense of smell and because “long COVID sounds nasty.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
7,We're Not Prepared For The Next Pandemic Phase: Dealing With Long COVID,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost It’s been a year and a half since Rebekah Hogan got COVID working as a nurse, and she has since seen more specialists to provide some relief from long COVID than she can count. She sees her primary care doctor every four weeks, largely to get the documentation she needs to apply for continued disability benefits. She’s seen pulmonologists, cardiologists, neurologists, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, psychiatrists and neuropsychiatrists. Hogan’s long COVID symptoms run the gamut, from severe nerve pain to exhaustion. Her brain fog is so severe, she jots down why she is making phone calls before she dials so she doesn’t forget. She no longer drives. “I’ve done all the tests, I’ve gone to all the doctors. Nothing gets better,” Hogan said. “Nothing comes of it,” she continued. “Nothing comes of anything.” Hogan is one of countless individuals. It has been two years since the first COVID long haulers began alerting the rest of world to their condition, and many still feel stranded. They worry that now that post-omicron, there are millions more people who are going to start facing what they’ve faced — and we’re no better prepared than we were two years prior. “People are beyond frustrated. They’ve been left behind. If COVID has been our greatest battle, these are the people who’ve been left on the battlefield,” said Diana Berrent, founder of Survivor Corps, a support group for COVID survivors that Berrent says has more than 200,000 members. “It’s finally getting more attention, but that’s not going to heal anyone. That’s not going to get anyone back to work,” she said. “We’re pretending the pandemic is over, but it’s not.” “It’s finally getting more attention, but that’s not going to heal anyone. That’s not going to get anyone back to work. We’re pretending the pandemic is over, but it’s not.” Among the many challenges facing long COVID patients and researchers is simply that two years into the pandemic, we don’t even have a clear consensus on what defines long COVID. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization have different timeframes for when it starts and how long it lasts. (The CDC says some patients have symptoms that last weeks or months after their initial infection; the WHO says the symptoms must last at least two months to be considered long COVID.) We don’t even have a clear-cut answer on what to call it: There’s long COVID, post COVID and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or PASC. More frustrating still, experts still do not fully understand what causes some people to develop long-term symptoms while others recover. “It’s important to know where we are and where we are going. We still don’t know the mechanisms of the disease. We don’t have an official definition,” said Dr. Fermando Carnavali, an internal medicine physician who works with long haulers at the Mt. Sinai Center for Post-COVID Care. “Uncertainties are everywhere. Despite everything that we have tried, we don’t have a laboratory test that can identify conditions and etiologies of post-COVID.” And the range of long COVID symptoms reported by patients is huge. Fatigue and “brain fog” sit atop the list, but patients also struggle with everything from heart palpitations to debilitating nerve damage. Some people do not regain their ability to taste or smell for months; others with parosmia find everything they eat tastes like sewage. There’s also emerging evidence that the neurological impact of long COVID is more serious than experts initially realized, leading to Alzheimer’s-like damage to the brain. Yet among medical professionals like Carnavali, there is a quiet sense of optimism that some forward progress has been made. He said that his institution and others are “heavily invested” in tackling questions about what causes long COVID and how to treat it, as well as how to better support patients in the here and now. “We’re absolutely better prepared now, mainly because the medical community has a general consensus on the main screening symptoms long haulers suffer from,” explained Dr. Marjan Islam, co-director of the COVID-19 Recovery (CORE) Clinic at Montefiore Health System in New York. Islam pointed to research linking long COVID with myalgic encephalitis ― or chronic fatigue syndrome ― which causes extreme, lasting fatigue and at the very least has a clear overlap with many of the symptoms long COVID patients experience. Understanding long COVID through the lens of chronic fatigue gives health care providers a set of shared therapies to try, Islam said, and can also help organize research. At the same time, he acknowledges the disparities in care patients are able to access, especially if they’re nowhere near one of the many post-COVID centers that have cropped up in hospitals and research facilities around the country. He believes seminars and other types of professional education could help instill best practices on how to treat patients grappling with chronic fatigue symptoms. “The health care system still does not have enough experience with long COVID where there are enough physicians available who understand the disease and know the treatment and management principles,” Islam said. Patients with long COVID not only have to fight to get the medical care they need; many have spent months fighting for disability benefits, which can be particularly challenging because many of the symptoms of long COVID are difficult to “prove.” Long haulers report being denied because insurance carriers say their symptoms are insufficiently serious, even with doctors’ notes detailing their condition. “The health care system still does not have enough experience with long COVID where there are enough physicians available who understand the disease and know the treatment and management principles.” Despite the optimism of some researchers, many people with long COVID feel like they’re no better off now than they were at the start of the pandemic. Given how challenging it can be for patients to access any kind of meaningful help, Kate Porter, 37, thinks of herself as one of the lucky ones. She tested positive for COVID at the start of the pandemic, as did her daughter who also struggled with long COVID for months. Her symptoms have been wide-ranging. As she puts it: There have been “so many weird things going on in my body.” Extreme fatigue sits near the top of the list. At points during her experience, Porter has been so wiped out by simply doing some basic chores around the house she’d end the day utterly unable to move. Now, she feels like she’s 85-90% back to where she was before COVID hit, which she attributes in part to a medication she is taking that is traditionally prescribed to HIV patients. Some doctors are prescribing off-label regimens for patients that are not without controversy. In the absence of effective treatments along with challenges getting into post-COVID care centers, some people with long COVID are turning to unproven therapies and interventions in the hope of getting some kind of relief. They’re also accepting that they may never get back to who they once were or how they once felt. “I don’t know that ever be 100% back to to my pre-pandemic normal, but I’m at least functional. I’m able to work again,” Porter said. While she is heartened by the fact that more people are talking about long COVID, as well as the existence of long COVID care centers, she worries too many people are falling through the cracks. “This is affecting so many people. It’s ruining the lives of so many people,” she said. At the height of the omicron surge, the United States was seeing more than 800,000 cases a day ― likely an underestimate, given how many people were testing at home. Porter often wonders many of those people will be dealing with symptoms months down the line. Where will they get help, especially when it has been so difficult to come by already? At the two-year point in the pandemic, there is an obvious tension between where many experts think we’re headed in terms of being able to better support those with long COVID, and what patients feel. “They’re used to lengthy studies and protocols,” Porter said. “But from a patient perspective, a lot of us can’t afford to wait for that timeline. That’s where this disconnect is.” Doctors like Carnavali acknowledge the tension, and said a lot of the work his team at Mt. Sinai does now is to try and adjust expectations. They make it very clear to their patients that they are now living with chronic illness, and they tell them that very directly. The goal is not to make them feel hopeless; it is to validate what they have gone through, and acknowledge that the road ahead is long and uncertain. “I have seen a couple of patients when I say that, they look at me with complete surprise,” Carnavali said. “These are people who have been suffering for two years. I think that part of the surprise comes from the fact that we have approached this with the hope that we can do a couple things and you’ll feel better, or it will go away, but what we know now is that it does not necessarily go away.” It’s becoming increasingly important to reach out to your primary care physician if you have symptoms you cannot explain and that are not going away. And Carnavali emphasized again that the COVID care centers that have cropped up around the country are able to try and address the full range of patients’ mental and physical conditions. For patients seeking answers, they can be an important place to start. Still, many long haulers say they worry the research is moving too slowly, that access to specialists and treatments is still uneven, and that the rest of the world still does not understand that we are in the midst of a mass-debilitating event. “My fear is there’s no fixing it,” Hogan said. “And people are just going to have to learn to live with these symptoms.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

8,A Second Booster Dose? ,coronavirus, Microbio
9,I Gained 70 Pounds During COVID. Here's What Happened On My First Day Back In The Office.,coronavirus," Deputy Editor, HuffPost Personal Given all the things that have changed in the past two years of life under COVID, my body is almost certainly among the least important. But that it has changed is undeniable. When I started to hear people talking about the “COVID 15,” referring to the widespread phenomenon of quarantine weight gain, I thought it was cute because I had already gained more like 40 pounds. Now, two years into a pandemic that drastically changed everything about the way we live, I’m estimating that number is closer to 70. (I haven’t weighed myself to be sure, but my clothing is now four or five sizes larger than when we took our laptops home from the office in March 2020, assuming we’d be back in a few weeks.) Pre-pandemic, I commuted to work every day. I used to walk to my subway stop, climb up and down multiple sets of stairs and then move around an office. Before or after work some days, I used to go to a gym, either the nearby chain I belong to, or the one conveniently located in the building where I worked. I used to go to spin classes in small dark rooms full of people sweating while breathing all over each other. Then I used to walk to another subway station and climb more stairs to get home. When COVID first hit, the gyms shut down. By the time they reopened, the thought of breathing heavily in an enclosed space had become nerve-shattering. I’m someone who actually enjoys working out, and relies on it for mood management, but I was scared to go back except in rare times when the COVID rates would dip long enough for me to hit the elliptical. I got into taking dance classes virtually, something I never would have done without the shield of distance, and clumsily channeled my inner Britney and Beyoncé in my living room (and eventually outdoors, when classes started to meet in the park). Getting out of my comfort zone with dance was a joyful pandemic surprise, and it got me sweating, but it didn’t compare to being an active everyday human. My diet hasn’t changed significantly, but there are many days when I sit at home all day, barely moving from the one spot where I hunch over my laptop until it’s time to walk the two blocks to pick my son up from school. As a result of all that inactivity, my weight has slowly but steadily climbed. I’ve got as much internalized fatphobia as the next gal, but I wasn’t initially too alarmed. My weight has always fluctuated, Oprah-style. I was a fat kid who lost 100 pounds in college, then maintained it ― not so much because I didn’t like my body before, but because I didn’t like the way I was treated in that body. Walking to and from elementary school, people would yell at me out car windows and throw the occasional fountain drink at me. As I got older, strangers felt free to discuss my body, approaching me to to tell me about a diet that worked for their aunt’s cousin’s friend. While visiting a college as a high school senior, a cute guy asked for my phone number, but when he called he wanted to know how much I weighed because, he told me, he “likes a woman he can climb.” Moving through our society in a fat body means constantly being confronted with others’ opinions of it when you’re just trying to exist. One benefit of having a “societally acceptable” body is that sometimes you’re allowed to forget about it. Nobody, not even Cardi B., gets to “fat in peace.” Fat people face discrimination in every aspect of society. Weight discrimination plays a role in hiring, determining wages and firing. (Racism also intersects with fatphobia, with studies showing that fat Black women are discriminated against most in the workplace.) We are more likely to to experience medical bias and misdiagnosis, which can be deadly. I don’t like dating apps, but even if I did, I’m not sure I could stomach opening myself up to a volley of microaggressions alternating with fetishizing messages that turn immediately sexual. “So much has changed ― fundamentally shifted ― during this pandemic and we’re watching to see how the world will resettle on its axis. No one is coming back the same as they were before.” Simply trying to get by as a fat person in a society that hates fat people can be disempowering, painful and, frankly, exhausting. When I first lost weight, I felt like a spy in my new body, witnessing the immediately evident ways in which I was being treated differently, as well as hearing right out loud the things that many people really think about fat people. They didn’t know I was only passing for thin. Inside, I was still on team F.A.T. I still love fat people and fat bodies. More important, I believe fat people deserve to be treated equitably in every aspect of society. We should all be working to stamp out fatphobia and fight size discrimination. But despite these convictions, I was exhausted, and existing in a smaller body was much, much easier. In the two decades since that time, I have gained and lost, struggled with body image, and never have gone so far as to actually call myself thin. With the clarity of hindsight, however, I can see that I always remained within a range to reap the benefits of thinness. And all it took was one global crisis to remind me how hard it can be on the other side. If I mentioned my weight gain around my smaller girlfriends, they’d counter by insisting that they have also gained weight during the pandemic. What they didn’t always understand is that going from a size four to an eight is not the same experience as moving into a marginalized body. Given the extreme level of invasive fatphobia we are all being pummeled with, I don’t doubt that their weight gain was uncomfortable, even painful. But they still retained their essential privilege as thin people. My weight gain changed the way I am likely to be treated by the world. That said, the world was still a largely hypothetical concept. Social distancing protocols kept me operating primarily from my home, or socializing with one deeply loved friend at a time ― people in whose presence I felt accepted no matter what. In the privacy of my apartment, with no one to see me, it was easy to slip into brain-in-a-jar mode. But as restrictions begin to ease (whether wisely or unwisely), the world and its opinions about the way I look are about to come flooding back in. This got real when my company announced our return-to-office date last week. For the first time in years, I was going to sit under fluorescent lights and be perceived. I was going to walk farther than from my bed to my couch in open terrain. I was going to be confronted with a reflection that contrasted with my mental image of myself in the office’s full-length bathroom mirror. While I had noticed my weight gain when working from home, I wasn’t aware of it on a minute-by-minute basis, and I certainly didn’t have to worry about what anyone else thought about it. Not to mention, what was I going to wear? My closets were full of clothes that didn’t fit me anymore and my New York apartment was starting to reach capacity for how many differently sized wardrobes it could hold. Nervous about seeing co-workers who hadn’t seen me since I was much smaller, I perhaps counterintuitively started shopping for something fabulous and distinctive to wear my first day back, ultimately selecting an attention-grabbing pink suit, something that would be totally over-the-top in our casual office. I couldn’t hide out while wearing neon Barbie pink ― feeling like my extra, stylish self was the best way I knew to bolster my confidence and signal to anyone who might have something to say that I am happy with who I am, and deserving of respect at any size. When the day finally came, I did feel self-conscious. But I felt that way about everything associated with remembering how to be a human again. When it was time to hand my ID to the woman at the front desk, I felt fumbly and nervous like I had forgotten how to do basic tasks associated with being in public. Talking to maskless co-workers was surreal. Ultimately, commuting in heels felt weirder than the fact that I’ve gained weight. And compared to my experience 20 years ago, things do seem slightly better, at least in my bubble. Nobody said anything rude or back-handed to me. I’m an adult now and there are fewer bullies to hurl fountain drinks at my head. Everybody raved over my pink power suit, which I wouldn’t even have been able to wear 20 years ago because hardly anybody sold plus-size clothing. By writing this, I know I’m opening myself up to be reminded of just how many people are still out there dying to share their shitty criticism and hot takes on my body, which let me be very clear, I DO NOT WANT. But I know I’m not the only one struggling with returning to the world with a very different body, and I want everyone else navigating this experience to know that they are not alone, and they are not any less valuable than they were before they gained weight. A girlfriend recently told me that every time she sees someone she hasn’t seen since before the pandemic, she finds herself wondering, “Are they thinking about my body?” And they might be, fleetingly, if it’s changed in obvious ways. But so much has changed ― fundamentally shifted ― during this pandemic and we’re watching to see how the world will resettle on its axis. No one is coming back the same as they were before. When we are finally able to climb out of survival mode after this traumatic, globe-changing event, I’m hoping most people will be far more concerned about how to acclimate back into their long-abandoned routines, how to fortify their depleted mental health, how to honor those we have lost by relearning the little things we didn’t know were what added up to make us human. I hope it’s soul stuff we’ll be focused on, not bodies. I do want to get back to a more active lifestyle, because, well, movement feels good. But whether I eventually lose the weight I gained or not (and if I do, I will miss you, massive boobs!), I have to do my best to accept my body where it is every step of the way. Because honestly, what’s the alternative? Stewing in self-hate? Accepting the fucked up messages we’re fed our whole lives and feeling the way they want me to feel about my body? It’s been a long two years. I simply refuse to waste any more time. Emily McCombs is the Deputy Editor of HuffPost Personal.

Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative,” he posted on Twitter. The 60-year-old said his infection is a reminder for those unvaccinated to get the shot, “even as cases go down.” I just tested positive for COVID. I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down. Cases have been falling in the U.S. over the past 30 days, but more than 1,400 deaths due to the virus are still being reported each day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. News of the former president’s positive test result comes almost exactly one year after he and his wife, Michelle, publicly announced that they had gotten the vaccine and encouraged others to follow suit. “It’s our best shot at beating this virus, looking out for one another, and getting back to some of the things we miss,” the former first lady said in a social media post. “Getting vaccinated will save lives—and that life could be yours.” Obama also appeared in a vaccine public service announcement with former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. Former President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the virus in late 2020, before today’s vaccines were available, has separately also said he’s been vaccinated. In December, he confirmed he has gotten a booster shot. President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, have also been vaccinated.

2,"Mask Mandate On Planes, Other Transit Will Be Extended Into April",coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing guidance that will ease the nationwide mask mandate on airplanes, buses and other mass transit next month, according to a U.S. official, but the existing face covering requirement will be extended through April 18. The requirement, which is enforced by the Transportation Security Administration, had been set to expire on March 18, but was extended by a month to allow the public health agency time to develop new, more targeted policies. The requirement extends to planes, buses, trains and transit hubs. According to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the announcement head of time, the CDC is developing a “revised policy framework” for when masks should be required on transit systems based off its newly released “COVID-19 community levels” metric. As of March 3 more than 90% of the U.S. population is in a location with low or medium COVID-19 Community Levels, where public face-masking is no longer recommended in indoor settings. “We have to look not only at the science with regard to transmission in masks but also the epidemiology and the frequency that we may encounter a variant of concern or a variant of interest in our travel corridors,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on March 2, explaining why the agency was delaying removing the requirement for transit but allowed people to gather maskless in movie theaters and sports arenas. News of the extension and policy review was first reported by Reuters."
3,Why Some People Still Haven't Gotten COVID,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost When I tested positive for COVID-19 over the winter holidays, I spent a good bit of time puzzling over how and where I was exposed. I was infected just as omicron was ripping through New York City, so it wasn’t a surprise. But I am also a fairly COVID-cautious health reporter. I wore an N95 in public settings, I’d been working from home, and I was newly boosted. How did I end up with a breakthrough infection and not, say, my husband, who goes into work every day? Why was I the one exposed, and not my unvaccinated preschooler who spends his days in the company of germy 3-year-olds? Of course, health experts have warned since omicron took over as the dominant strain that everyone is likely to get COVID-19 at some point. And a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that used blood tests to check for coronavirus antibodies suggests that there have been many more cases than our official counts suggest. Yet all of the data we have at this point suggests there are still millions of Americans who haven’t been infected. So what gives? How can it be that two years into a pandemic marked by increasingly contagious variants, so many people remain COVID-free? What separates those of us who have tested positive from those who haven’t? Here are a few reasons why some people have never had COVID-19 at this point in the pandemic. Maybe you’re sick of hearing it, maybe not. But doctors, researchers and public health experts have long been harping on the same basic preventive tools for a reason: They work. “There are a few measures that have shown to reduce the spread of infection: getting effectively vaccinated, wearing masks indoors, and maintaining physical distance,” said Dr. Marie-Elizabeth Ramas, a New Hampshire-based family physician. A study published just this week found, for example, that requiring masks in schools may cut infections by nearly 25%. Of course, that data comes at an interesting time, when many of the last states with mask mandates in schools are dropping them. Ramas’ note about getting “effectively vaccinated” is an important one, reflecting that boosters have become an important tool ― although less than half of people who are fully vaccinated have received one at this point. So if you’ve managed to avoid infection so far, there’s a good chance it’s because you’ve been diligent about masking up, avoiding crowds and getting your shots as soon as you were eligible. “You’re talking to someone who has not had COVID despite it ruling my life for the past three years, and seeing tons of patients who have it. ... A lot of it is just self-management in terms of getting vaccinated and boosted [and] making sure that you have adequate PPE and being fastidious with it,” said Dr. Kevin Dieckhaus, chief of infectious diseases at UConn Health in Connecticut. While both Dieckhaus and Ramas agreed that the vast majority of people have been exposed to the coronavirus over the past two years, both noted that there are some people who are seriously immunocompromised and who have largely hunkered down during the pandemic. About 7 million Americans are considered immunocompromised, a category that includes (but is not limited to) people who have had cancer, who have had organ transplants, who are undergoing chemotherapy or who are on immunosuppressive medications. While many of these people have found ways to safely head out in public, for others, isolation has been their only real option. And let’s not forget that the millions of people with weakened immune systems need this level of protection still. As one woman whose husband had a heart-lung transplant recently told me for a story on what it’s like to be immunocompromised in the pandemic: “What I wish people who don’t know an immune-compromised person would know is that COVID is still here and it is still a real threat to our most vulnerable members of society.” Whether or not you had COVID-19 and were simply unaware was a bigger preoccupation for people earlier on in the pandemic, when we were hopeful that a prior infection would provide longer-lasting immunity than it actually does. Still, there is new data suggesting it’s entirely possible that you fall into this category. A recent CDC survey of more than 70,000 blood samples taken during January looked for antibodies generated after COVID-19 infection (not vaccines) and found that about 43% of Americans have been infected with the virus. That’s a much higher rate than national case counts suggest. The survey found that infections among kids were even higher. About 58% of children have had COVID-19 during the pandemic. “This is why getting tested is so important, particularly in school-aged children,” Ramas said. “This will reduce disruption of continuity of learning and unnecessary exposure to teachers and paraprofessionals.” Experts say the odds are very good that most of us have been exposed to the virus by now, but a few factors can make a major difference in whether you get infected or not (on top of whether you’re masked and vaccinated). One is how much virus the person is putting out, as some people shed a lot more than others. Others include how close you were to the infected person and what the ventilation was like. Researchers are trying to determine exactly how often household transmission happens. It’s a difficult number to pin down, in part because people’s home settings vary so widely, as do their behaviors when someone tests positive and is supposed to quarantine. (Are they masking up? Opening windows? Is everyone vaccinated, etc.?) It’s also a challenging thing to measure because the virus itself keeps changing. Omicron is more contagious than delta. The omicron subvariant BA.2, more contagious still. “There are a lot of factors that we probably don’t understand,” said Dieckhaus, who added that he and his team are studying household transmission right now. However, the estimates we do have clearly show that household spread is not inevitable. A CDC report says that during omicron, about 1 in 2 people in a household developed COVID-19 if someone else was infected. Within that group, there were differences. The attack rate was lower in households where the positive person isolated, where people were vaccinated, and where people masked up. While there are clear, well-established mitigation strategies that have helped lower individual risk of contracting COVID-19, “a lot of it comes down to a hefty dose of just good luck,” Dieckhaus admitted. He recalled several conversations over the past few years with patients who could not figure out where or how they were exposed, because they had been careful all along. “There’s a lot of randomness to COVID,” Dieckhaus said. “There are people who seem to have minimal exposure who come down with it, and there are people who have heavy exposure who seem to do OK.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

5,What Are The Chances Your Kid Already Had COVID And You Just Didn't Know It?,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost When I got a breakthrough COVID infection in December at the height of the omicron surge in New York City, I was certain I’d pass it on to my two young kids. One is old enough to be vaccinated; the other isn’t. We live in a small two-bedroom apartment and were stuck together for 10 days. Surprisingly, neither of my kids tested positive. That could have to do with the fact that household transmission is not a given. Recent Centers for Disease Control estimates suggest that during the omicron wave, 1 in 2 household contacts developed COVID-19 — a high risk of infection, but not inevitable. But it also seems possible that my kids didn’t get sick because they’d already built up immunity through prior infection that my husband and I just didn’t know about. I’m especially skeptical that my 3-year-old has truly gotten through the past two years unscathed. He was home with us for a long stretch early in the pandemic but has ultimately returned to day care, and then preschool, where his masking has been, at best, unenthusiastic. So what are the odds that my kids — or your own — had COVID at some point in the pandemic and you just didn’t know? Here’s what the most recent research says. The CDC recently released new estimates that suggest that, as of late January this year, about 140,000,000 Americans have been infected with COVID-19. That’s roughly 43% of the U.S. population. That estimate comes from more than 70,000 blood samples tested in January specifically for antibodies generated after COVID-19 infection. Known as a seroprevalence survey, this research estimates the percentage of people in a population who have antibodies to something infectious — in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Notably, the 140,000,000 estimate the CDC found is about double what verified case counts suggest, which means millions of people in this country have had COVID without knowing it. And the infection rate among kids seems to be even higher. The recent CDC data found that 58% of kids up to age 17 have COVID antibodies. It makes sense. Children were in school during the omicron wave, and that variant is much more contagious than previous ones. Kids also tend to have milder symptoms than adults, so their parents and caregivers simply may not have known they were infected at all. While using antibody tests to get a broad, population-level estimate of how many people have had COVID can be a valuable public health tool, it’s not as useful individually. “[Antibody testing] is primarily done by blood draw, but several kits are available to do by finger stick as well,” Dr. Kelly Fradin, a pediatrician and author of “Parenting in a Pandemic,” told HuffPost. The CDC advises that people reach out to their doctor to ask about whether they need one. “Notably, if your child had COVID months ago, or had a mild case of COVID, the antibodies generated might have come and gone before you do the test. Accordingly, a test is limited in its ability to tell you about prior infection.” And that is one reason why seroprevalence surveys can really only offer estimates, not exact numbers of how many people have had COVID during a certain period of time. Of course, there are different considerations for children who are immunocompromised or who have underlying health conditions. In those instances, health care providers may pay very close attention to signs of possible COVID infection in addition to tracking antibody levels after vaccination. Not only can antibody tests miss prior infections depending on how much time has lapsed, but there are also bigger questions about how long someone is immune to COVID after they are infected with it. Most experts believe you (or your child) are protected from COVID for at least three months — possibly up to six — after an infection, but that’s really a best guess. And recent data from the Netherlands suggests that some people who were infected with the initial omicron variant, BA.1, have been getting infected with the newer omicron variant, BA.2, less than two months after their initial infection. Fradin noted that at some point down the road, as we learn more about COVID’s long-term impact on things like heart health, experts might want to know if kids have been infected so they can, say, screen them before they participate in sports. But that’s just a hypothetical scenario at this point. For now, given the limitations of antibody testing — as well as the fact that no one really knows how much a COVID infection protects kids after they catch the virus — it may not matter much whether my kids have had COVID up to this point. If you wonder how to make certain decisions about your child’s activities over the next few months as omicron continues to recede and mask mandates and other restrictions disappear, talk to your child’s pediatrician. They may not be able to tell you definitively whether your kiddo has had COVID before, but they can help you figure out how to move forward in a way that feels right for your family. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

7,"Florida Ignores CDC, Will Advise Against COVID Vaccine For Kids",coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost The leader of Florida’s health department plans to buck federal guidance and recommend against giving the COVID-19 vaccine to healthy children, a move that ignores overwhelming evidence about the safety and efficacy of the shots. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who has been widely scrutinized for his opposition to vaccines and masks throughout the pandemic, announced the plans Monday at a roundtable arranged by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. “The Florida Department of Health is going to be the first state to officially recommend against the COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children,” Ladapo, whom DeSantis appointed last year, said during the last few minutes of the meeting. It was not immediately clear which age range Ladapo’s new guidance would affect. #BREAKING: Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announces the state is going to be the first to recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy kids. https://t.co/6WyvgYczS2 pic.twitter.com/gSxA2g2YOn Earlier during the roundtable, Ladapo suggested the medical community and other vaccine advocates have been conspiring to mislead Americans and exert control over them. “[There’s] individual rights, individual choice, and truth on one side, and really sort of overarching powers, overarching government, abuse of powers, abuse of data, dishonesty and frankly, a lot of unethical behavior on the other side,” he said. Ladapo is an outlier on this issue. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which employs thousands of scientists, doctors and other medical experts, firmly advocates for children 5 and up to receive the COVID-19 vaccine approved for that age group, citing rigorous studies and a thorough approval process by the Food and Drug Administration. Among both adults and children, side effects or other complications linked to receiving the vaccine are extremely rare, the CDC has found. The most serious of those possible conditions are much more common in people who are actually infected with the virus. So far, more than 8 million kids ages 5 to 11 in the U.S. have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. The FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech series for that age range in October. Ladapo has refused to say whether he is vaccinated against the coronavirus and repeatedly evaded questions about it, saying that’s private medical information. “I personally believe that people can make their decisions for themselves with information, and I think that in some ways they probably make decisions that they’re more comfortable with if elements like coercion or misrepresentation of data or hiding of data are not part of the process,” he said when pressed about his vaccine status last month. Ladapo and his aides also refused to wear face masks when visiting the office of state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was about to begin radiation for breast cancer, last fall. Polsky says she told Ladapo she had a serious medical condition and needed him to wear a mask, but that he refused and would not tell her why.

8,"For Those Who Are Immunocompromised, 'Normal' Isn't Even Close",coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost The day after Thanksgiving 2021, Sherry Alvarez’s 11-year-old son Samuel was diagnosed with leukemia. The months since his cancer diagnosis have been a whirlwind: chemotherapy, nonstop hospital visits and blood draws to track Samuel’s neutrophils — white blood cells that play a crucial role in fighting off infection. Some days, they’re at relatively normal levels, so Samuel can maybe go outside and play or Sherry can comfortably run errands. Other days, they drop precariously low and the whole family pivots into lockdown. Nobody leaves unless it’s an emergency. The risk to Samuel’s immune system is simply too great. Over these past grueling months, Sherry has been comforted by the mask mandates in place in the county where her family lives in Wisconsin. “Every time I hear they’ve extended them, it’s been a huge relief. It’s like, ‘OK. That’s one thing I don’t have to worry about,’” she told HuffPost. “Having a kid with cancer, there are so many things you have to think about and navigate and plan for.” But last week, her local county’s mask mandate ended, and Sherry feels they have entered a new phase in the pandemic. Now, she not only feels a different kind of fear about the potential risks to Samuel’s health, but a gnawing anxiety about the kind of feedback she worries they’ll face as they continue masking up. “Now I have to, as a grown adult, worry that someone’s going to say something rude and nasty to me or to my son,” Sherry said. “I know I shouldn’t care about it, but my emotions are so out of control right now.” Over the past few weeks, there has been a flurry of activity easing mask mandates and other COVID restrictions around the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now no longer calls for routine masking in public indoor settings in areas with low community transmission. School districts have been changing their rule, too. On Monday, New York City — the nation’s largest public school district — made masks optional for K-12 students. The changes are being celebrated by many who believe they’re an appropriate step given the precipitous drop in new COVID cases and hospitalizations. But some doctors and researchers worry health officials are moving too soon, particularly those who work with immunocompromised patients. And among those health experts — as well as those with weakened immune systems and their loved ones — there is a fear that it is too much change, too soon. People’s lives are most certainly being put at risk. “Patients feel that they’re being abandoned or left on their own,” said Dr. Gary Lyman, a cancer doctor and researcher with UW Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who has been studying the impact the pandemic has had on cancer care. “In a sense,” he added, “they feel they’re being forgotten.” Throughout COVID, the estimated 10 million people who are immunocompromised — either because they have certain health conditions or because they are undergoing certain treatments — have been among those at the highest risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19. For that reason, the CDC has called for those 12 and up to receive four shots of the vaccine: three doses that make up their primary series, and a fourth that is considered a booster. Earlier research had shown that only about half of people with weakened immune systems build a sufficient antibody response after two doses. But even with a recommended four-shot regimen, there remain questions about how much immunocompromised individuals are protected from serious complications or hospitalization if they get COVID, which is why universal masking in public settings has been a crucial public health measure. One-way masking does offer some level of protection ― particularly if the wearer has on a high-quality, well-fitted medical grade mask like an N95 ― but just how much protection is not entirely clear. There are so many variables at play, it is impossible to study. What are local caseloads like? How crowded is it? What’s the setting? Universal masking removes so much of that guesswork. “How do we explain to our son that people are yelling at us for wearing masks because we are simply trying to take good care of each other? I am angry, but mostly the anger is because I am so hurt.” That kind of confusion now pervades daily outings for people with weakened immune systems and those who care for them. Jocelyn, a 39-year-old from Florida who who has a toddler and whose husband had a heart-lung transplant that requires he be on daily immune-suppressing medications, expressed a mix of cautious optimism and frustration. (Jocelyn works in a hospital and asked to use only her first name to protect herself professionally.) “We do feel a sense of hope now considering my husband received his fourth vaccine dose recently,” Jocelyn said. But she also feels too many people around her are “ready to move on and pretend COVID isn’t real.” The couple’s toddler is too young to be vaccinated, and they’ve encountered negativity when they’ve masked up outside. Their son loves animals, and they’ve tried to take him to the zoo several times. “But people don’t wear masks and they crowd us, sometimes even heckling us about wearing our KN95s outside,” she said. As people who are immunocompromised try to navigate these social situations — to the extent they even feel safe or comfortable heading out into the world — they’re feeling a growing sense of being alone in their outlook as everybody else seems to move on. “A year or two ago, everybody was feeling this. Everybody was in lockdown. There was a solidarity. But now when you see the world is opening up, you risk feeling more isolation and stress,” said Ranak Trivedi, a clinical health psychologist with Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “That’s both for patients and for caregivers.” Ultimately, immunocompromised people and the doctors who treat them do not expect mask mandates and other COVID restrictions to last forever — and many spent years prior to the pandemic taking extra precautions as they went out in public. Every person interviewed for this story expressed a clear understanding that COVID is here to stay. It is also not as though the CDC’s decision to roll back mask mandates came out of nowhere. The new guidelines about when to mask up in public take into account new variables, including not just new COVID cases but also how many hospital beds are open in a given area. Public health leaders have called them “reasonable and well-timed.” For others, however, it simply feels too soon. Sherry, for example, said she’d like to see vaccination rates increase before mask mandates disappear — particularly among children. (Only about a quarter are fully vaccinated right now.) As her family waits, they do very little outside their home. Samuel recently tried to play outdoors with some neighborhood kids, but they teased him for wearing his mask. Sherry said he takes it all in stride, but watching the world move on without her boy is “heartbreaking.” “It’s really a challenging time and I feel so sorry for these folks. It’s not new. This goes back two years where there’s this sense of, ‘Our needs have not been considered fully,’” Lyman said. “We know that eventually we’ll be out of this. It may even be in the coming months. But we frankly just don’t know when yet.” So during this next stretch, doctors, mental health professionals and immunocompromised patients are imploring others to at least have a bit of grace — or even basic manners — about their situation. It is important to remember that COVID is still a significant and even deadly risk for many, and that for many the new changes are not a source of relief. People who are wearing masks aren’t doing so to make a statement; they may well be trying to keep themselves or a loved one alive. “What I wish people who don’t know an immune compromised person would know is that COVID is still here and it is still a real threat to our most vulnerable members of society,” said Jocelyn, who added that her family’s “faith in humanity” has all but evaporated over the past two years. “How do we explain to our son that we can’t go to the hockey game because no one wears a mask and it isn’t safe for daddy? How do we explain to our son that people are yelling at us for wearing masks because we are simply trying to take good care of each other? I am angry, but mostly the anger is because I am so hurt,” she said. Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost"
9,This Hospital Is On A Mission To Return Items To Families Who Lost Loved Ones To COVID,coronavirus,"  This essay is part of “Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost Italy. It has been translated into English and lightly edited for clarity. “‘We are here, and we will do everything we possibly can to help’ ― that’s what we wanted to say to every person, to help give them some meaning to all the pain and to find somewhere to place all their suffering.” Gabriella Di Girolamo, director of the health care staff at Piacenza Hospital located in northern Italy, recently told HuffPost Italy. During the first wave of the pandemic, when hundreds of infected people were being admitted to the COVID wards every day, the health care facility spearheaded a one-of-a-kind project to collect and store all of the victims’ personal belongings in the hope of one day returning them to their relatives. The pandemic hit the hospital hard from February to June 2020, so much so that the staff was forced to completely reorganize the entire facility. “During the first wave, more than 120 people a day were arriving sick with COVID,” explained Di Girolamo. “Within 20 days we found ourselves with all 750 of our beds occupied.” Because of the lack of space and the fears about contagion, patients were admitted alone, without anyone accompanying them. “We had to manage every aspect of finding somewhere to put them ― and their personal items too,” Di Girolamo said. Initially the hospital opened a “COVID emporium” ― a space where family members could bring pajamas, clean underwear and other essential items to be given to their sick relatives. Then staff began collecting all the patients’ belongings: watches, jewelry, cell phones, a mountain of clothes, as well as dozens and dozens of wedding rings, and as a photo accompanied by a Post-it note with the words, “see you soon.” The staff put everything in one room, which they called the “personal items room.” “In the beginning we only needed a few bags to store the items, but within a few days we had nearly 500 containers, along with many other small bags containing valuables,” Di Girolamo said. “We bought in safes to secure patients’ chains, wallets, earrings, and watches. Then we deposited everything in containers with the Civil Protection service.” When COVID prevention measures were first downgraded in Italy in May 2020, health care workers began to return items to families — and they made a tragic discovery. “In many cases, there was no one who could retrieve them, because entire families had been killed by the virus,” Di Girolamo said. The process of returning the items to families is still happening. “I felt the suffering that people experienced at the moment of separation with my whole being,” Di Girolamo said. “I remember a phone call from a daughter who was looking for several of her mother’s things ― clothing, accessories, jewelry. I carelessly asked her, ‘Your mother took all those things to the hospital?’ And she replied, ‘When she was taken away she didn’t even have time to take them off.’ I felt stupid and insensitive. I realized too late that she was an elderly person who probably took good care of herself and liked wearing the pearl necklace and watch even at home. Another daughter said to me, ‘If you could return even just my mother’s nightgown or her bag of cosmetics, at least I’ll be able to smell her.’ This was the moment I realized that, despite the how difficult it was to return all of the items from both a practical standpoint and an emotional one, we had to move forward with this project. I thought, we owe it to people.” Another episode that particularly touched Di Girolamo involved a boy who had been adopted and came to retrieve the personal items of his adoptive family, who had all died from COVID. “We don’t know anything about the boy’s origins, but it’s easy to imagine that he had already experienced difficult separations in his life,” Di Girolamo said. “Now life had once again confronted him with another abandonment. First his family was taken away, then he was given a new one, and then that family was taken away from him too,” she noted. “To Giovanni, from Pasqualina” and “To Pasqualina, from Giovanni” read the inscriptions on a pair of wedding rings which have become something of a symbol of this “operation” to return objects of sentimental value. “We don’t know whether this married couple died during COVID, or whether they were already deceased and these wedding bands belonged to one of their children, a grandchild or a relative to keep their memory alive,” Di Girolamo said. “We are still looking for a family member who this legacy of love can be returned to.” Contributions to the working group were also made by Anna Nassani, from the hospital’s mortuary staff, Paola Cella, from the medical services department, and Mirella Gubbelini from the continuing care department. “The vast majority of the items have been returned, though we’re aware that some things were probably lost in the confusion early in the crisis, or as patients moved between different wards and hospitals,” Di Girolamo explained. “We want to honor these deaths. It was a defining moment of our civilization,” she added. “Today when I think back to all these moments, I can picture two hands moving apart from each other ― one of a father, child or relative being taken to hospital, and one of the person left behind at home with that feeling of sudden separation. It seemed only right for us to make every possible effort and we did everything we could to meet with the relatives, even if the process took a very long time and it brought back a lot of painful memories for everyone. But it was the right thing to do.” Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we’re looking for here and send us a pitch! "

0,This Doctor Examined The First COVID Victim In Greece. Here's How Her Life Has Changed.,coronavirus," Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost Greece This essay is part of ″Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost Greece. It has been translated into English and lightly edited for clarity. Amaliada is a small town in western Greece with 17,000 inhabitants, mainly farmers who grow potatoes, watermelons, olives and oranges. Theoni Georgopoulou’s practice is located on the first floor of a small building, tucked in the central square of the town. Almost all private clinics in Amaliada are located in this square and almost everyone who lives there know the doctors by their first names. “Everyone calls me Theoni and most of my fellow citizens who got sick during the pandemic came to my office,” says Georgopoulou, the only pulmonary and tuberculosis specialist in Amaliada. Georgopoulou will never forget Feb. 28, 2020, or what played out within the walls of her 165-square-foot office on that day, when a local group from Amaliada returned home from a vacation to Israel. “I got a call on that Friday morning,” she told HuffPost Greece. “A patient I’d been monitoring for years told me he had a fever and that he would like to make an appointment. Due to flu season my practice was busy, so I asked him to come see me in the early afternoon when it would be quieter.” When the patient arrived, Georgopoulou followed typical protocol and ran some tests. “Two days later the wife of this patient came to see me with a cough,” she said. “It was just a cough. Nothing else. No fever, no other symptoms, but it was a very intense cough. Three days later, the day the first case of COVID-19 in Greece was announced, I was seeing the last patient that had gone on that trip.” It turns out those patients were the first in Greece to be diagnosed with COVID-19. Just weeks later, this lung specialist from this small town in western Greece was overwhelmed by tears during a television appearance where she spoke about the death of the nation’s first COVID-19 victim. “I don’t know if it was the most difficult event in my life, but it was definitely the most difficult to cope with,” Georgopoulou said in the interview. “He was my high school math teacher, a friend, an educator, a trade union campaigner for 30-40 years. I knew him from when I was 13 up until 54, which is the age I am now. I owe this man a big thank-you, because even as he was dying, I never stopped learning from him. He taught me things that were both useful for my patients throughout these two years and for me personally.” Antonis Fourlis, HuffPost Greece’s editor-in-chief, spoke with Georgopoulou about the pandemic, what she’s learned, and how it’s changed her. HuffPost Greece: Two years after the outbreak of COVID-19, what is the biggest change you’ve seen? Two years later, everything has changed in our daily lives. Above all, it’s human contact [that’s changed the most]: the hands we do not shake, the hugs we do not receive from the people we love, how we’ve come to avoid our unvaccinated friends. If we were to divide the “before” and “after” periods of the vaccine, the anxiety and noise of the initial months has been replaced by the gift of science. Slowly but surely, we can feel safer and happier in our homes, surrounded by our parents and children. How has the pandemic changed you personally, both as a doctor and a person? I became more tolerant of human fear, but I need to manage my frustration with misinformation about COVID-19. As a doctor, I now schedule telemedicine calls and teleconsultations more often than I’d prefer. And, of course [laughs], I became the “Front-Line Corona Warrior,” as my daughter calls me. That title has replaced pulmonary-tuberculosis specialist, which is written on the sign [on my office]. The pandemic is often described as “a nightmare” ― one we’d like to wake up from. Is there anything positive you’ve seen emerge during the last two years? Knowledge ― we’ve gained more knowledge on a daily basis. And another definite positive is the closer cooperation and solidarity among colleagues, as well as the health professionals who have been called on to help combat the virus. You examined the man who ended up being the first victim of the pandemic in Greece. What did you learn from that experience? You can’t put a price on health, and strengthening health infrastructure across all levels must become a priority in Greece and around the world. Every time a patient with severe COVID symptoms wins the battle, I think of that first tragic incident and reassure myself that, at least for now, we know more about this disease. When I first met you 23 months ago in Amaliada, you told me that you believed we would beat COVID. Did we win? And if so, at what price? Unfortunately, the fight continues. Even though we’re tired and we may want to ignore it, COVID continues to attack. But science has won, thanks to the vaccine and drugs, which were trialed successfully. Many people, however, were lost. Too many were taken. We’ve all changed, and it will take time before we can leave this pandemic behind us.

1,I Work In A Nursing Home. The Horrors I've Seen During COVID Continue To Haunt Me.,coronavirus," Guest Writer This essay is part of “Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost Spain. It has been translated into English and lightly edited for clarity. I live in Madrid and work in a nursing home. I’ve been asked to talk about my experience and the experiences of others working in this sector during the coronavirus pandemic. I can’t sit down and write this without breaking down in tears. All I can say is that it was horrible. Total madness. A situation of complete helplessness. Before the state of emergency was declared in Spain in March 2020, we already had COVID cases in the home where I work, both among the staff and the residents. At first, they told us not to wear masks because we might frighten the residents. When people started dying, it was already too late. There was not enough equipment or PPE for all the staff at that point. We considered ourselves lucky if we could use a surgical mask that lasted two or three days. We were scared to go to work and terrified of bringing the virus home with us to our families ― or of getting sick ourselves. In the end, we all got COVID-19. We were in the first line of fire. But the ones who bore the brunt of the virus were the residents. On April 20, 2020, when I caught it, 63 of the 180 residents at the home had already died. It was total chaos. We were forbidden from referring residents to the hospitals. There were bodies in body bags. We took food on trays to the residents, who were locked in their rooms, and we had no idea if they ate it or not. It was a terrible attack on human dignity. Their families knew nothing ― they received dribs and drabs of the bare minimum of information. We were forbidden from using our phones to allow the residents to speak to their families over video chat. It must have been so hard not knowing if they were OK. I’ve lost my father and mother and sister ― not to COVID ― and I feel lucky to be able to have been there, clutching their hands, as they died. I didn’t have to leave their side. That was awful, of course, but I can’t imagine the suffering of the people whose family members were stuck in a room in a nursing home, or a hospital, without being able to hold their hand and say goodbye. I think that is the worst torture a human being can go through. It’s taken time for me to be able to say this, but I’m glad my sister died a year before the pandemic. I’m glad I was able to be with her. Maybe I’m just oversensitive? In the midst of the pandemic, a neighbor of mine, whose husband was in the nursing home I worked at, asked me to go and see him to let her know how he was. I couldn’t say no, even though I ran the risk of getting into trouble. The man was on the sixth floor and had a fever, and I was going to see him to comfort my neighbor. The managers of the nursing home accused me of going up to the sixth floor to take photos of the dead bodies. It took me months to get up the courage to tell my therapist about it. I was even embarrassed about it. Physically, when I caught COVID, I had a fever, lost my sense of smell and taste, got rashes on my skin, my hair fell out, and I had arrhythmia and tachycardia, which I still get. I got some sense of smell back and occasionally my sense of taste. Mentally, I had to start going to therapy. I have always been a very strong woman. I’ve always refused to acknowledge my vulnerability. I’ve been through so, so much in my personal life. I took care of my sister, who was disabled, and my mother for years. I was ready to face anything but the pain of seeing the old people like that ― seeing them confined to their rooms 24/7. I can’t get over that. I started having sleep disorders and nightmares. I felt like crying all the time and had a terrible feeling of helplessness. The nightmares about these people dragged me down ― they broke me. My whole body went downhill. I went from being a really strong woman who could take on anything to feeling like a rag doll. My doctor automatically referred me to the mental health department. I’ve been in therapy for 14 months. I still have a scar on my soul, which I don’t think will ever go away, but I’ve learned to live with it. Therapy got me out of the hole I was in. I refused twice to take medication because it made me feel groggy, like I was in limbo. It took me a long time to share my experiences, but as soon as I was able to talk about it and get everything off my chest that was pulling me down, I started to get better, although it’s been hard to get back to the person I was before. At least I have regained the strength and will to fight and live, which I had lost at one point. I am very lucky to have my therapist. Going back to the nursing home after those initial months was also hard. Whenever I saw the state of the survivors, I felt sick to my stomach. I just kept repeating to myself, “Come on, Paloma, get on with it, you’ve been through worse.” In the end, you get used to it. I’m just happy to think that my work can change people’s lives. For example, I managed to get my neighbor’s husband walking again after months of hospitalization due to COVID. We do this work because we want to. When you see those faces, you forget everything else. But the managers of this sector shouldn’t take advantage of that. We work in terrible conditions. Caregivers earn 985.34 euros a month by trade union agreement. Since I have a part-time contract, I earn 645 euros. You have to have quality of life, but also quality of death, and during a pandemic, you have neither. We are the residents’ first line of defense. We see the first signs of something not being right. We raise the alarm. We have a lot of responsibility, but the pay and respect we receive are low. We are thought of as the “ass wipers.” Nursing homes need to stop being seen as a business. Now that they have fewer residents, nursing home owners are trying to raise their profitability in other ways. And how do they do that? By cutting back on resources and staff. We experience tremendous physical strain, more than the usual emotional strain, and terrible frustration. But, still, they don’t hire more staff to help us. There may be fewer residents now, but they have greater needs, both physically and emotionally, and they need more love and support. Many have been left disoriented, and that’s difficult to recover from. COVID has brought all these shortcomings to light, but this was already going on before the pandemic. The only consolation we have is that the residents are now all vaccinated and that if the virus gets in again, we’ll hopefully be more prepared and protected. But we can’t ignore the fact that we have all been deeply affected by what we have seen. After such strict isolation, the residents’ faculties have really gone downhill. And most of the workers are in worse shape, too. I’m not the only one who has been in therapy ― not by a long stretch. Almost all health care workers have needed psychological help. And that has to change. The situation won’t be resolved by people going out on their balconies every evening at 8 p.m. to applaud. We don’t seem to have learned anything. As told to Marina Velasco. *Paloma Smith is a pseudonym being used by the author to protect her privacy and from potential reprimands by her employers.

2,This Woman Channeled Her Pandemic Anxiety Into A Campaign For LGBTQ Rights,coronavirus," Video editor, HuffPost Japan This essay is part of “Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost Japan. It has been translated into English and lightly edited for clarity. In December 2021, Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, announced that a “partnership system” that publicly recognizes the relationships of same-sex couples would be adopted in the city during the 2022 fiscal year. Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Japan, so they will not have the same legal standing as opposite-sex marriages, but same-sex couples will be able to benefit from certain services and welfare programs that opposite-sex couples are eligible for under the local governments that adopt this system. Over 150 municipalities and prefectures across Japan have already adopted this system. Soyoka Yamamoto, as the president of an association that wanted to ask the Tokyo government for a partnership system, submitted the request to Koike, accumulated over 10,000 signatures, and submitted a petition to the Metropolitan Assembly. The content of the petition was later recognized by all members of the assembly. Yamamoto was motivated to push for this change primarily by the anxiety she experienced while living with her partner during the COVID-19 pandemic. She spoke with HuffPost Japan about her life over the past two years and her hopes for the future. I have been living with my partner for about 10 years. She is my best friend, companion, comrade and my family. She enriches my life. When we’re together, our troubles are halved and joys are doubled. I am happy every day because I have someone I can love and cherish by my side. During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite spending more of our precious time together shopping, cooking and taking care of our home, it felt even more inconsistent that our relationship is not officially recognized as being that of a family. My anxiety was intense, and it escalated. What if my partner or I got sick? If we were legally recognized as family, we would be able to speak to doctors about each other’s statuses and prognoses and we would be able to visit each other in the hospital. I heard stories from people who could not visit their family members during their final moments as they were dying from COVID. I could not stop crying when I thought of how unbearable it would be if my partner and I couldn’t be together during the most difficult situation of our lives. As I contemplated the possibility that our relationship wouldn’t be recognized ― and we would therefore be unable to be together ― I knew I had to do something about this. At the end of 2020, a few LGBTQ couples who were our friends gathered together and we had a modest Christmas party. It was supposed to be fun, but at some point, we began talking about how we were all feeling anxious about our situations. When someone said they wondered if the Tokyo government could do something for us, I said, “I’m going to find out.” I really felt that I could do something. In preparation for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, an ordinance banning all sorts of discrimination was enacted in 2018. I learned that there were many progressive people when it came to introducing such systems. But there had been little progress in recognizing the rights of same-sex couples. So, I sent a message to a member of the Metropolitan Assembly whom I had known for some time. I told them that I wanted to submit a petition and start an online signature campaign. That’s when the push to ask the Tokyo government for a partnership system began. I was in my teens when I first realized I liked girls. I was mischievous and animated. I was a soccer-loving kid who could befriend anyone. But when I realized I was attracted to girls, I lost confidence. In order to fit in, I told lie after lie ― not just about who I was attracted to but about so many things. I told myself I had to like whatever everyone else liked. The more I tried to fit in, the more lost I felt. I was worried my friends would think I was disgusting if they knew the truth and, sadly, I soon began to think of myself as disgusting. I thought that I had to deny who I really was in order to be liked. In college, I studied abroad in the United States and I was moved because I saw it was a place where all kinds of people could be themselves. There were people from many different backgrounds and with many different identities, including openly gay people. That’s when I finally thought, I can be me. Once I came out, I no longer had to tell or live the lies I had been telling and living, so my life became easier. Now that I was myself, I was able to make close friendships, and life became fun for me. I believe learning to love who I am and being proud of who I am is a big part of why I agreed to lead the campaign for a partnership system. I am really happy that a partnership system will be introduced by the Tokyo government in 2022. Same-sex partners are family, too ― and I want to create a system that fills in the missing pieces that keep our relationships and families from being seen as valid as opposite-sex couples. What I don’t want is the government just issuing certificates. I want same-sex partners to be treated as family members with full access to the services the Tokyo government should be providing to everyone who lives there. Beyond creating formal regulations that prohibit discrimination, I want to create an atmosphere where LGBTQ people no longer have to fear coming out or being open about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Though we are still waiting for legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Japan, we are seeing encouraging movement. In 2015, the Shibuya and Setagaya districts in Tokyo were the first in the country to introduce same-sex partnership systems. Many local governments across the country are listening to the voices of the parties involved and they are doing their best to create partnership systems independently. So what about the rest of Japan? Things have changed quite a lot over the past few years. According to a nationwide survey conducted in 2019, over 60% of Japanese people approve of same-sex marriages. In 2021, a decision in a Sapporo court declared that “it is unconstitutional to not recognize same-sex marriages.” The partnership system is also a kind of “voice” that pushes for same-sex marriages to be recognized. Campaigns that aim to create systems in various local governments, as well as the systems themselves, are connected to the deepening of societal recognition. The more LGBTQ people are seen and heard and embraced, the more persuaded I believe the country will be to finally welcome same-sex marriage in Japan. Most of the reactions I’ve seen regarding the introduction of a partnership system in Tokyo have been, “I want Japan to hurry up and make same-sex marriages a reality.” Similar initiatives are being carried out in different areas across the country. I am hopeful that if we raise our voices, things will change. Still, right now, many LGBTQ people in Japan are irritated. Their civil liberties are not being protected. There is a sense of uneasiness as they live their lives while trying to avoid being hurt by the words and actions of those around them. I am hoping that by starting the campaign for the partnership system in Tokyo, my actions will help so many other LGBTQ people. As I continue to fight, I have been able to come out to those I meet, thereby affirming who I am, and I want to live a happy life. By living my life in a way that embodies the idea that LGBTQ people can be happy, I hope to have a positive influence on society. I am hopeful that my campaign will gain a foothold, be recognized as a good example, and become a source of strength for other places in the world where LGBTQ rights have not improved.

3,I Attended A K-Pop Concert In Seoul During The Pandemic And It Was Surreal,coronavirus,"  This essay is part of “Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost Korea. It has been translated into English and lightly edited for clarity. Two years have passed since COVID-19 brought upheaval to our lives in South Korea. So many people have lost something that, before the pandemic, was a fun and meaningful part of their lives. If you ask me, a huge fan of the K-pop group NCT 127, what I lost to COVID-19, I would immediately say “face-to-face concerts.” Concerts and overseas music tours were canceled, and face-to-face events were replaced by virtual events, so we have only been able to see our favorite K-pop groups on a screen. Fans like me have been longing for in-person performances. In November 2021, our government implemented a process intended to bring some normalcy back via the “With Corona” policy. Face-to-face events and concerts, which had been prohibited up until that point, were now allowed to take place with fewer than 500 fully vaccinated people in attendance. Large-scale performances could be held if they were approved by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. The entertainment industry did not want to miss this opportunity to begin staging live shows again, so many promoters hurriedly began to organize concerts. My prayers for an NCT 127 performance were answered with the news that a three-day concert series was going to take place at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. This venue usually accommodates about 20,000 concertgoers, but due to the COVID protocol, the number of tickets for each show was limited to 5,000. The fans were overjoyed, especially since these concerts were NCT 127’s first in-person performances in Korea since January 2019. As soon as the concerts were announced, many fans said they would be willing to do anything ― even hang from the Sky Dome’s ceiling ― for the chance to see the shows. We all wanted K-pop back, but now that it was returning, fans were stressed out because they knew how much competition there would be to get tickets ― and because no one knew how long it would be before more concerts would take place. I was barely able to purchase a ticket for the first concert. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases skyrocketed to the same level as my excitement, I became really worried that the concerts would be canceled. I decided to stay home from the moment I got my ticket up until the concert because I didn’t want to risk coming into contact with someone who had COVID and lose my chance to see the show. Finally, December 17, 2021 ― the first day of NCT 127’s face-to-face concert series ― arrived. The government’s “vaccine pass” rule applied to any performances with more than 500 attendees, so concert staff had to check for proof of vaccination and negative PCR test results from all audience members as we entered the dome. We were each assigned to a seat with one empty seat between us, and masks were mandatory for the duration of the event. I nervously made my way into the concert hall after my identity and vaccination certificate had been checked. Fans were told to keep in mind the “three major mayos” (a Korean meme that combines the words “mayonnaise” and ”mayo,” from the expression ”hajimayo,” or “don’t”): “Don’t scream. Don’t stand up. Don’t walk around.” I was worried that I might subconsciously start doing any one of these things because I, like most people, was so used to singing and screaming and shouting at concerts. Instead of singing along and screaming, the only sound we were allowed to make was clapping. When the members of NCT 127 finally appeared on stage, I was so happy to see that they really do exist. I immediately had the urge to make my presence known by screaming, so I had to place my hand over my mask to stop myself. When they asked the crowd, “Are you guys ready?” all I could do was vigorously wave my light stick. Although there were about 5,000 ecstatic fans there, the arena was stunningly quiet. Because we couldn’t scream or chant or sing, I gauged the volume of the applause to determine which performances were the most popular with the fans. The moment Johnny began his shirtless dance routine, the clapping went off the charts. I could hear some fans letting out whimpers, as if trying to get out their emotions any way they could. They also hit their thighs or pulled their hair, but there was no yelling. Not being able to yell was a new kind of torture for us.  Even after the thrilling dance numbers, all I could hear were fans clapping. It felt as if I were at a classical music concert, not a K-pop show. At the end of the show, I felt tears in my eyes when Haechan said, “We were all so happy meeting all of you in our dreams. Let’s dream a happier dream next time.” I’m not joking ― I really did practically cry. There had been so many moments when I wasn’t sure whether this face-to-face concert was really going to happen. Of course, the fans weren’t the only ones who missed these events ― performers have also been longing to get back onstage to connect with audiences. Another band member, Mark, said, “If I think about it, preparing for a concert like this and having our fans come to see the performance are such normal things. But not being able to do such normal things has made me realize how precious normalcy is. Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to feel such joy again.” The number of COVID-19 cases reached 7,000 per day during the week of the concert series. On December 18, the second day of the series, the government started implementing stricter quarantine measures, including shortened operating hours for temporary concert venues and a reduced number of attendees for events. Fortunately, NCT 127’s concerts proceeded as planned without any changes because the band had been granted approval from the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. After the series was over, I felt like I had woken up from a short but sweet dream. Next time, I hope I can scream and shout until I lose my voice instead of just clapping until my hands are raw. That will truly be the day when K-pop fans and artists can dream happier dreams. But until then, even if I’m only allowed to clap, I say, “Let’s go, in-person concerts!” Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

4,I Transitioned During COVID. Going Back Into The World Feels Unsafe In A Whole New Way.,coronavirus," Guest Writer This essay is part of “Survive. Thrive. Evolve: How Two Years of the Pandemic Impacted Us Around the World,” a global HuffPost project featuring individuals writing about how their lives were affected after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.The following piece originally appeared on HuffPost U.S. At this point in the pandemic, I’ve spent about 18 months more or less isolated at home, leaving mostly only to get groceries or to pick up takeout meals. Before the pandemic, going to the office, meeting up with friends for dinner and drinks, playing board games in person, visiting family and going to conferences were all normal, but they now threaten exposure to COVID-19. I recognize the immense privilege of being able to isolate in my home with my partner, but my world has nonetheless changed dramatically throughout the course of the pandemic. In the past year and a half, I’ve come to think of the outside world as a threat, as a source of exposure. When case rates fall, however, and as I consider the possibility of reentering the world, the outside world has come to feel unsafe in entirely different ways. Safety, as I’ve come to learn, is a relative concept. About a year ago, a little under six months into the coronavirus pandemic, I started to think of my gender somewhat differently. Without the many ways that we enforce gender roles and performances on each other in day-to-day interactions, I began to understand how much of the way I thought of myself was a product of that social pressure. In the comfort of my home, and with the support of my partner, I began to explore my gender and to experiment with how I present. It started small ― wearing some of my partner’s dresses and seeing how they felt on me, trying out different jewelry or using they/them pronouns around the house and with other members of my family. Home is somewhere I can be comfortable as myself, even when I’m not sure what exactly that even means. More than just that comfort, however, home has also been a place where I am in control. When I am on virtual meetings, I can use my microphone to take control of how and when I am heard. Using my webcam, I can choose how to present myself to my peers even to the extent of using virtual backgrounds and video filters to control how others see me. By changing my display name, I can be sure that the first thing my co-workers see about me is my pronouns. When I am feeling especially dysphoric, I can even turn my camera off. In the evening, the virtual worlds of Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy XIV provide still more control, with every aspect of my online self under my control at the click of a button. As I struggled with real-life decisions, like whether to start laser hair removal or hormone replacement therapy, control over my virtual presentation was effortless and easily reversible. In the world of Eorzea, I can look hot as hell as a level 80 red mage without worrying about whether I “pass” to strangers. It is precisely this control that I do not have when I go to pick up a takeout meal and hear transphobic comments from others waiting for their brunch, when I shop for groceries and wonder if people’s stares are meant for me, when people make incorrect assumptions about my gender or even when I walk our dog around the block and wonder which of our neighbors might view my trans body with disgust or hate. The intense focus placed on transgender identities both at the national and the local level further underscores that stepping out of my door means stepping into a world outside of my control. Elections are won by stoking hatred, even down to transphobic flyers left in our mailboxes. That this appeal to hate works shows me something of how I am viewed by those around us. These fears are not new, of course. Misogyny and transphobia did not start or end with the pandemic. Throughout my career as a researcher in quantum computing, I have experienced firsthand the harassment that can come with a hyper-masculinized culture. Many of my colleagues have experienced far worse on the basis of their gender, orientation, disability, race or from intersections of different forms of oppression, while I benefited from the safety of being perceived as male and by the privilege afforded by my whiteness. In one especially memorable “joke,” a former colleague cross-dressed at a party and encouraged others to sexually harass him, treating gendered harassment as something so trivial as to elicit laughs. I was furious at the misogyny and the transphobia, furious on behalf of so many other colleagues who had been harassed, but the threat to me was at most abstract. I was able to make my protest known, to leave the party and to sleep in my own bed knowing that I was not personally the target. When I revisit that moment now, that same threat feels much more personal, concrete and immediate. During the height of the pandemic, the existential threat posed by COVID pushed many of these concerns out of mind, replacing them with the fear of exposure, concern for our loved ones, of stress and panic as even otherwise mundane health issues take on new dangers and risks, and the grief we feel for the friends and family we’ve lost to COVID. Perhaps it’s no wonder then that in the face of such existential fear, the control and comfort of home have become all the more important. The prospect of reentering the world means leaving that space of relative comfort and control in order to confront threats and fears that I didn’t have before. I’m hardly alone in this, either. For many of us, leaving lockdown means facing the racism, sexism, transphobia and ableism we had found some degree of safety from in our homes. Still, many more of us face all of the same but without the privilege of being able to shelter in a safe home, whether due to homelessness, the demands of being an “essential worker,” domestic violence or any number of other things that may deny the relative safety of shelter. The prospect of spending the majority of my day outside of my house means I can’t avoid using public bathrooms as easily. The thought of traveling again brings with it the fear of being intentionally misgendered, groped or even worse by the Transportation Security Administration. I used to take things like getting dressed or shaving in the morning as mundane, but now there’s an urgency to making sure I look feminine enough not only to avoid dysphoria but also to avoid casual hatred from others. If those of us who can actually do get vaccinated, get our boosters and continue to wear masks and practice social distancing, then maybe that care can also bring with it the hope of seeing friends and family together in person again. It may bring the hope of travel, of eating out, of seeing movies in theaters, of attending concerts and plays, of working in coffeeshops and libraries, of tabletop gaming at actual tables, of tweet-ups with friends, of picnics in the park. Even as uncomfortable as it is for me to consider going back into the world as my authentic self, there’s so much to look forward to enjoying with family, friends and colleagues. It’s easy for being transgender to feel like something awful, threatening or even just awkward, especially given how often we’re made the scapegoat du jour by politicians and celebrities looking to rile people up. It’s easy, but it’s not true — for me, being transgender means having the agency to define my gender in a way that reflects who I actually am. I have an opportunity in front of me not just to reenter the world but to do so as my true and whole self. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

5,Former Child Star Ricky Schroder Has Public Meltdown Over Museum Mask Rule,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Former child star Ricky Schroder, last seen harassing Costco workers who asked him to wear a mask in the store, had another public meltdown over rules intended to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This time, Schroeder flipped out on security guards who asked him to wear a mask before entering the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum in Abilene, Kansas, calling them Nazis and telling them they should only enforce “God’s law.” The video, shared on Instagram by Schroder and on Twitter by Patriot Takes, which monitors right-wing media, showed Schroder berating the guards. “Evil federal government, right?” he asked the guards. “That’s your opinion,” one of the guards replied. “That is my opinion,” Schroder said. “God’s laws are higher than the federal government’s, but you’re going to enforce man’s laws?” After a brief exchange, he told the security guards they “don’t know God,” called them Nazis and stormed out: While traveling with the freedom convoy, maskless Ricky Schroder was denied entry into the Dwight D. Eisenhower museum and called the security guard a “Nazi” for enforcing “evil federal government” mask rules. pic.twitter.com/XTcqwEfijQ Patriot Takes also posted other videos of Schroder. “We’re not gonna live as slaves,” he declared in one clip. Schroder made his name as a child actor in the 1980s sitcom “Silver Spoons.” As an adult, he is best known for his three seasons on “NYPD Blue.” But it’s Schroder’s right-wing politics that caused his name to trend on Twitter on Sunday: “I have just one purpose … and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right-wing wants a fight, they are going to get it … either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won’t be with them anymore.”- Dwight D. Eisenhower https://t.co/hSclqrvQNU White privilege is behaving like an incredulous asshole and then comparing the minor inconvenience you created for yourself to brutal, warmongering, genocidal regimes. 🤡 https://t.co/sv9ScHN9IX I love how he thinks telling the guy his name is Ricky Schroder will help. Also, when did he get a southern accent?! https://t.co/p7kE2djY5w So far Ricky Schroder has done battle with a Costco employee and a guard at the Dwight Eisenhower Museum, in his courageous fight for America’s freedom from mask mandates. And, scene. There are grandmas in #Ukraine making Molotov cocktails to fight off an invading army and Ricky Schroeder wants you to know he won't be a ""slave"" to wearing a mask nobody's asking him to wear anymore. https://t.co/fQ8uV9MRXu Wow, Ricky Schroder is still that entitled little brat he played on Silver Spoons. https://t.co/LUDBeT9Pc9 He called the security guard a Nazi. What a tool. https://t.co/EfyIrwnjC6 Wow. Glad I never had a crush on Ricky Schroder.Comparing a basic health precaution to Nazism?  Eisenhower would block Schroder, too.PS: ""God's Laws?""  Newsflash, has-been: this is NOT a theocracy. You have a right to believe what you want, but NOT try to make it federal law. https://t.co/lzEDKBR7kY This may be Ricky Schroeder's best dramatic role, yet. https://t.co/RnStzIEzrB this type of rhetoric was always eyerollingly dumb but now stands in stark contrast to the actual existential threat being fought by Ukrainians every day https://t.co/SkWA6q7JbF Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
6,Coronavirus Death Toll Surpasses 6 Million As Pandemic Enters Its 3rd Year,coronavirus," BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll from COVID-19 eclipsed 6 million Monday — underscoring that the pandemic, now in its third year, is far from finished. The milestone is the latest tragic reminder of the unrelenting nature of the pandemic even as people are shedding masks, travel is resuming and businesses are reopening around the globe. The last million deaths were recorded over the last four months, according to the tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That’s slightly slower than the previous million, but highlights that many countries are still struggling with the coronavirus. Remote Pacific islands, long protected from the virus by their isolation, are just now grappling with their first outbreaks and deaths, fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant. Hong Kong, which is seeing deaths soar, is testing its entire population of 7.5 million three times this month as it clings to mainland China’s “zero-COVID” strategy. As death rates remain high in Poland, Hungary, Romania and other Eastern European countries, the region has seen more than 1.5 million refugees arrive from war-torn Ukraine, a country with poor vaccination coverage and high rates of cases and deaths. The United States is nearing 1 million reported deaths on its own, the largest official death toll in the world. Despite the enormity of the figure of 6 million deaths — more than the populations of Berlin and Brussels combined, or the entire state of Maryland — experts say the number is likely a vast undercount. With poor recordkeeping and testing in many parts of the world, many deaths have not been attributed to COVID-19, and there are also the excess deaths related to the pandemic but not from actual COVID-19 infections, like people who died from preventable causes but could not receive treatment because hospitals were full. An analysis of excess deaths by a team at The Economist estimates that the number of COVID-19 deaths is between 14 million and 23.5 million. Overall, some 450 million cases of COVID-19 have been recorded. It's too early to declare victory over #COVID19. Many countries are facing high rates of hospitalization & death. With high transmission, the threat of a new, more dangerous variant remains real. We urge all people to exercise caution and all governments to stay the course. pic.twitter.com/hLtKCsp4ER"
7,How To Cope When You’re The Only One Wearing A Mask At Work,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, Work/Life Under the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, more than half of the U.S. population lives in an area now considered to be low or medium risk for COVID, and residents there can go indoors without a mask. Many states have also loosened mask mandates, and a lot of workplaces no longer require employees to wear masks as a result. If you’re still most comfortable with a mask on indoors in an office setting, you may suddenly find yourself to be in the minority. And when you are one of the only people with a face mask during meetings, it can feel socially awkward. That’s why it can help to remember why masks are effective and to have a strategy in place if a colleague does inquire about your mask. Epidemiologists and other COVID experts weighed in on one-way masking benefits, and offered conversation strategies for mask-wearers: If none of your co-workers are wearing masks, you may wonder if there’s a point to you wearing one. But well-constructed, tightly-fitting masks do offer protection, even when others are not wearing them, too. “They do work. Somebody who is wearing a respirator in an office setting is going to get a fair degree of protection from doing that,” said Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Any mask is better than no mask,” said Jose-Luis Jimenez, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and an aerosols scientist.  “To make up for the fact that other people are not masking, you should wear a high-quality mask.” Jimenez described high-quality masks as ones that are breathable, with a good filter that prevents most aerosols from being inhaled, and with a secure fit that has no gaps on your face, such as an N95 mask. “Have the strength of your convictions and realize you may be the smartest person in the room” And keep in mind the public health stakes. “What you are doing is minimizing the chance that you inhale a respiratory disease. That’s the big reason to stay masked,” said Charlotte Baker, an epidemiologist in public health at Virginia Tech. Although cases are declining in the U.S., there is still plenty of COVID out there. Around 1,800 deaths continue to be announced most days. “There is no need to feel embarrassed or apologetic for wearing a mask,” Rupp said. “In most communities in the United States today the level of transmission continues to be substantial. ... It’s headed in the right direction, but there is still a lot of COVID that is being transmitted in our communities.” Rupp said masking should not be seen as a choice between never wearing your mask at work or always having to wear a mask at work. You should be open to changing your mind depending on individual circumstances. “You may feel safe and not wear a mask going into a setting where there is a lot of room and few people and a short duration of time,” Rupp said. “Whereas you might feel very uncomfortable making that same decision in a smaller, crowded setting that you are going to have to be present for an hour.” Rupp cited your community’s virus transmission rates, your building’s indoor ventilation, your colleagues’ vaccination status, and your own health risks as factors to consider before taking off your mask. Here’s the CDC tracker for checking out your county’s transmission rates. Be open to putting a mask back on as we learn more about the latest COVID developments, too. “Six weeks from now, or three months from now as a new variant starts to be described, they may decide, ‘You know it’s time for me to put the mask back on,’” Rupp said. “Social pressure is very real. We can be talked out of anything if enough people dissent to our point of view,” said clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula. She cited social psychologist Solomon Asch’s research on conformity, which found people were more likely to give a wrong answer when they heard other people give that wrong answer out of a motivation to avoid conflict. Your decision to wear a mask is none of your colleague’s business. You don’t owe anyone an explanation of why you are masking indoors, but if sharing one helps you feel less awkward, keep it brief, Durvasula advised. “Make it about yourself and don’t turn it into a polemic on public health and responsibility,“ she suggested. “If a person chooses to wear a mask that is their right, but it can turn difficult if the mask-wearer frames it as virtue.” Whether you are doing so to protect the health of others or for your own personal risk tolerance, Durvasula advised not engaging too much about it in the workplace: “Don’t take the bait.” Baker said if it makes you feel more comfortable, it’s alright to deflect to another topic if it comes up or “just be stern one time, and say, ‘Look I’m going to wear it, I don’t want to hear anything else about it. It has nothing to do with you.’” Pep talks can also help when you feel peer pressure, too. Baker shared what she tells herself when she finds herself to be one of the only maskers in social settings. “I’m immunocompromised, so I tell myself I don’t want to die,” she said. “Two is: ‘I’m doing this for my family.’ I want to see my nieces, I want to see my nephews. I want them to grow up in a healthy world. If I wear my mask, I get to go see them. And I’m also setting a good example. And third is: ‘My mom is senior … and I need to keep myself healthy so I don’t get her sick.’” Baker noted that for people who have become numb to pandemic risks, external motivations like a vacation or a concert you want to be healthy to go to can also help. “Whatever that motivator needs to be for you, figure out what it is. Write it down, so you see it,” she said. Once you know your why, remind yourself of it when you want to waver from your original decision to wear a mask. And if you need an affirmation, take it from Rupp. “Have the strength of your convictions and realize you may be the smartest person in the room,” he said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

8,Why Can't Kids Just Get Bigger Doses Of The COVID Vaccine?,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost New data suggests that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was far less effective during the recent omicron surge in New York at preventing infections among 5- to 11-year-olds, who receive a smaller dose than teens and adults. In mid-December 2021, the vaccine was 68% effective at preventing infection among young kids. By late January, amid the omicron surge, it was only 12% effective at preventing infections among kids ages 5 to 11. Fortunately, the vaccine continued to fulfill its primary function and provide strong protection against hospitalization and death. Still, in light of the emerging evidence, some parents are wondering why 5- to 11-year-olds can’t just get the bigger, seemingly more effective dose. Here’s what vaccine experts have to say. The experts HuffPost spoke to emphasized one fact above all else: Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine remained effective at preventing kids from getting seriously sick, even during the omicron surge. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization dipped to 48% during omicron, but there was major variation in confidence intervals (basically, a measure of how certain researchers are of the data), making it difficult to draw solid conclusions. A lot of that has to do with the fact that overall hospitalizations of children remained pretty low, so there simply wasn’t a lot of data for the researchers to work with. And pediatric specialists say they’re pleased that kids continue to be protected against the most serious outcomes. “I don’t want parents to be discouraged by this data. I’m not discouraged by it,” said Dr. Ruth Kanthula, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist with MedStar Health in Maryland. “Omicron was a really mutated virus,” Kanthula added. “The fact that we even had any response to it is actually reassuring, and the fact that people were kept out of the hospital and from having serious infection because of [the vaccine] is great.” She urged parents of kids ages 5 to 11 who have not gotten their children vaccinated to do so. So far, only about a quarter of American children in that age group are fully vaccinated. Though it may seem like the COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly — and indeed, they were made available to millions of people around the world in record-breaking time — months of research went into studying the best dosage. That research is still ongoing in children 4 and under, who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated. So before researchers settled on the 10 microgram dose of the Pfizer vaccine in children ages 5 to 11, they looked at both lower and higher doses — including the 30 microgram dose given to adults. Ultimately, researchers on those initial trials concluded that the 10 microgram dose gave the best balance of what they were looking for: a robust immune response and relatively minimal side effects. Before the vaccine dose is changed for kids (if it ever changes), there must be clinical trials. The initial trials were conducted before the omicron variant emerged. “Why not just give 5- to 11-year-olds the 30 microgram dose? It hasn’t been studied yet,” said Dr. Matthew Harris, medical director of the vaccine program at Northwell Health in New York. For example, he pointed to the risk of post-vaccination myocarditis, which remains very rare but is higher among young males ages 12 to 39. Could that increase in younger children if they’re given bigger doses? Those are the types of questions researchers need to tackle before they make any changes. One of the challenges of being a pediatrician, Kanthula said, is that children aren’t just smaller adults. So doctors can’t just shrink down what they do in the adult population and hope it works. “Children are physiologically different from adults,” she said, adding that older children are physiologically different from younger children in everything from their height and weight to their heart and respiratory rates. “They’re all physiologically different. Their immune systems are different. And they respond differently to different things,” she said. Again, that’s why doctors can just apply the clinical data from one patient population to another. While public health experts are hopeful that we’re on the cusp of endemic COVID-19, that does not mean the virus will no longer be harmful, nor does it mean that it will fade away. “This isn’t going anywhere,” Harris said. He’s “quite certain” that vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna are asking exactly these types of questions about dosage and whether it should change — particularly as more variants arise. Another possibility is that children might end up getting a third shot at their current dosage ― not so much as a booster but as part of their primary routine, Kanthula added. Both Harris and Kanthula noted the frustration and confusion many parents may feel as this plays out in real time and best practices shift based on new information. But the core message stays the same, they said: Get your child vaccinated now if they’re eligible. The data still clearly shows it will help keep them safe. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

9,"For The Disabled Community, The Pandemic Has Had Hidden Costs",coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Two years of pandemic life have forced Crystal Evans to “play pharmacist.” “I’ve been dealing with constant medical supply shortages through COVID,” said the 40-year-old, who has a genetic neuromuscular disease and a spinal cord injury from an accident. Evans uses a ventilator and a wheelchair, but she’s had trouble finding supplies for both. A shortage of ventilator supplies means she’s had to use some equipment longer than she should, resulting in painful airway infections. She has been unable to get medicine from her regular suppliers, forcing her to find alternative sources for products she relies on, such as sodium chloride, sterile water and polyethylene glycol, a laxative. And when she does find them, she’s had to cobble ingredients together — which her insurance company has declined to pay for, claiming they’re not covered. Evans has also struggled with obtaining necessary home modifications, including equipment for an accessible kitchen. She’s been trying to replace the wheelchair ramp on her house since 2019, but now the cost of materials has more than doubled. “I’ve been trapped in my home without one,” said Evans, who lives in Braintree, Massachusetts. Supply issues have also made accessing wheelchair parts a challenge. She lost her wheelchair’s seat cushion, which could be adjusted with air to prevent pressure sores. During the weeks it took to get approval and delivery, Evans said, she was in “so much pain.” And when the cushion’s metal valves had to be changed, she found that companies were out of them and carried only plastic ones. “I can’t manipulate the plastic type,” Evans said. “I don’t have the dexterity.” Supply chain shortages and shipping delays have affected many industries, but the medical equipment and supply industry has been hit particularly hard. A 2021 market report found that the pandemic had “exacerbated a global shipping and logistics crisis,” causing specific difficulty for “wheelchair manufacturers to obtain necessary products, components, and raw materials.” Another report by Grand View Research found that the pandemic had significantly affected the supply chain for wheelchairs and that operations for wheelchair manufacturers and suppliers were paused across several countries during lockdowns. “What people aren’t seeing is how COVID is impacting vulnerable people because of the services and supply shortages and everything else,” Evans said, adding that she’s spent $4,600 out of pocket on medical supplies to maintain her independence. People with disabilities use a wide range of equipment. Complex rehabilitation technology (CRT), for example, is an umbrella term that includes many types of medically necessary and custom-made devices. Many also rely on what is known as assistive technology, which includes computer equipment, software and other products, and durable medical equipment such as walkers, canes, hospital beds, oxygen equipment, wheelchairs and blood testing strips for diabetics. A CRT industry supplier told HuffPost it has seen median supplier lead times — the time it takes for a supplier to receive a product after it’s made the purchase order — increase by about 20 days. And the longer it takes for suppliers to receive their orders, the longer it takes for those products to reach the people who need them. Craig Moulden has worked in the CRT field for more than 20 years. As an assistive technology professional, Moulden helps fit clients for new equipment, modify existing pieces of equipment and evaluate what people need when they receive a new diagnosis. Some of that work has been possible via email and phone during the pandemic, but not in-person visits. “Once COVID hit in the very beginning and doctors’ offices were shut down and therapy clinics were shut down, that pretty much, for a short period of time, shut us down,” said Moulden, who was working at Numotion, the nation’s largest supplier of mobility equipment, during the first two years of the pandemic. Insurance companies often require clients to have face-to-face appointments with doctors before they will cover costs. But many clients were afraid to go to their doctors due to COVID-19 and put off those visits, while other doctors’ offices and clinics were closed. Clinics and hospitals also stopped sending physical therapists out for home consultations. But now that better protocols are in place and more facilities are equipped to work virtually, Moulden said those appointments have picked up again. Tommy Roebig, a founding partner at the law firm Florin Roebig, said he has seen an increase in callers looking for help because insurance companies have made it difficult to receive rehabilitation technology and other services. But Moulden, who now works at National Seating & Mobility, said the industry has made some advancements in the last two years on that front, like introducing more remote technology. For example, technicians can now link to a client’s power wheelchair wherever they are and read error codes. “That’s kind of a game changer because most of the time in the past, a client called with an issue, we’d have to schedule an appointment to come out and see them,” Moulden said. “That’s just to put eyeballs on the situation, to identify it and say, ‘Yep, this is broken. We need to put in an order for that.’ Then we have to initiate the process of getting the quote and writing up the order.” Numotion is also partnering with companies to allow them to do evaluations virtually. It’s part of a wider movement toward more telehealth services and telemedicine, which help providers reach those who are at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Some of the changes that have been made during COVID are good, but the situation overall hasn’t necessarily gotten better, according to Marcie Roth, executive director and CEO of the World Institute on Disability, which focuses on key areas of accessibility and universal design, and works to advance the rights of people with disabilities. “I am a person with a disability. My life’s work has been in disability rights,” Roth said. “Our lifelong work has been in moving research and policy into action. We operationalize inclusion.” Getting customized equipment is “a lengthy process all the time” that has been made worse by a long period of “not being able to have people come into people’s homes, the supply chain — which may be as complicated as a chip issue or may be something as simple as something that is a widget stuck in a box on a boat somewhere,” Roth told HuffPost. “They need to maximize my independence, so that way, people like me can free up the hours for the people who can’t go to the bathroom or eat without assistance.” Over 61 million people live with disabilities in the United States, and they face a much higher risk of COVID hospitalization and death than those who aren’t disabled. Roth noted that people experiencing long COVID may also develop disabilities. And during the pandemic, more than 200,000 residents and staff at long-term care facilities have died of COVID-19. “There’s been lots of discussion about older people and people with underlying conditions, people who are frail or fragile, all these other euphemisms,” Roth continued, “but 96.3% of people in nursing homes have disabilities.” Roth said the needs of the disability community have long been an afterthought — not just during the pandemic. “We don’t fare well to begin with, and it is very obvious,” she said. “All the things that are impacting everybody else are disproportionately [affecting] people with disabilities.” Evans said she has a few advantages that make it a little easier for her to navigate the health care system. She works in health and disability policy and equity, and she’s more independent than many people with disabilities. But Evans said she has been denied certain requests that help her maintain her independence, such as a power door opener, on the basis that she could have a patient care assistant “do it for me.” “If I don’t need somebody here that often, why should somebody have to sit with me 50 hours a week in case I want to open a door?” she said. Another example: Evans said she needs help with prepping meals for the strict diet she follows due to a metabolic disease, but she does not need assistance with actually eating. “They denied an accessible kitchen on the basis that someone else could do it for me,” she said, adding that her insurance company also denied home-delivered meals. “I need home [modifications] critically, badly, and everything costs more right now,” Evans added. “I have the labor. It’s just the supplies and supply chain issues.” One important reason for fixing the current system and making it less bureaucratic, Evans said, is that it would help free up limited resources for others. “They need to maximize my independence, so that way, people like me can free up the hours for the people who can’t go to the bathroom or eat without assistance,” she said. Evans said she knows several people with neuromuscular diseases who have died during the pandemic due to home care shortages. In many cases, they experienced medical emergencies but were home alone because there were no personal care assistants available. “Everything costs more right now ... I have the labor. It’s just the supplies and supply chain issues.” “One girl fell out of her wheelchair on the vent. The vent disconnected, and it ended up killing her because there was nobody to help her reconnect quickly,” Evans said. “It was a shift she just couldn’t staff.” Mike Swinford, the CEO of Numotion, said the supply chain shortages — affecting everything from computer chips to wheelchair cushions — have driven all kinds of delays. On the other hand, “the demand side is spiking,” he said. When the pandemic started in early 2020 and people started working remotely while in lockdown, Swinford said many Numotion customers were unable to access the equipment and services they needed due to COVID-related concerns. Because a lot of people put off getting equipment fixed, by the summer of 2021, “we started to see volumes, especially for service and repair, just spike through the roof.” These problems are exacerbated by the complexity of health plans. “To provide service or to provide new chairs,” Swinford said, “we typically have to do an evaluation, we have to get a prescription from a physician, we have to submit all the documentation even for service, in many cases, to the insurance provider to get prior authorization before we can actually fix something that’s already been prescribed.” Authorization processes for a new wheelchair or service used to take about four days, he said, but now they take up to three or four weeks. Wheelchairs typically have components from three to five manufacturers. Numotion purchases these components from companies that get parts from as far as Asia and Latin America. Numotion’s website states that they “may occasionally need to adjust a previously communicated delivery date as component delays continue,” and it thanks visitors “for your patience as we all work through these highly challenging global supply chain issues.” Swinford said he is hopeful that the statement will no longer be necessary moving forward. The record backlog peaked early last fall, and though demand is still high, Swinford thinks it is finally starting to flatten. But the underlying issues remain. It’s a “bureaucratic, cumbersome process that desperately needs reform,” he said. On Assignment For HuffPost"

1,Gov. Ron DeSantis Bullies Teens Into Taking Off Masks For Press Conference,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Gov. Ron DeSantis scolded a group of teenagers on Wednesday for wearing masks while they stood behind him during a press conference at the University of South Florida. The Florida Republican told the students to take off their masks as he took the podium to speak about funding cybersecurity education opportunities through the university. The students were in high school. “You do not have to wear those masks. Please take them off,” a visibly annoyed DeSantis told the students, all of whom were wearing masks. “Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this COVID theater. So if you want to wear it, fine. But this is ridiculous.” The comments were followed by some of the seven students taking their masks off. Several of the teens chose to keep their masks on for the press conference. Meet the real @GovRonDeSantis. (footage: @EvanDonovan)pic.twitter.com/sTsKHHQEfJ According to WFLA-TV, the students came from Tampa’s Middleton High School, which is part of the Hillsborough School District. HuffPost left a message for the school’s principal to confirm whether the students DeSantis scolded attended classes there. “We are excited our students from Middleton High School were highlighted as part of the statewide focus around cyber security education,” Hillsborough Superintendent Addison Davis told the station. Davis added: “As always, our students should be valued and celebrated. It is a student and parents’ choice to protect their health in a way they feel is appropriate. We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district.” The governor did not acknowledge the students after finishing his speech, which halfway through turned into commentary on political hot topics, President Joe Biden and Tuesday’s State of the Union address. DeSantis, whose state has experienced alarming levels of COVID-19 infections, has long opposed mask and vaccine guidance that would help the public battle the virus. The governor made several decisions last year in an effort to block mandates, and drew nationwide backlash for trying to withhold state funds from schools that implement them. A judge blocked that effort after parents sued the state, arguing that DeSantis’ order infringes on the rights of parents who want to keep their children safe. Last month, the Republican said that parents should be able to sue school districts if they have a child who was told to wear a mask in Florida this year. However, the governor appeared not to acknowledge students’ personal choice to wear a mask on Wednesday. Research has shown that wearing masks reduces the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed almost a million Americans since it was first identified in the country two years ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated guidance to say it no longer recommends mandating masks for most Americans, though anyone can choose to wear one if they feel safer doing so.

3,What Not To Say To Immunocompromised People Right Now,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost As the omicron wave continues to recede and COVID restrictions ease, many people are celebrating. To them, the end of mask mandates feels welcome, overdue and a harbinger of better times ahead. For others ― including the doctors and public health experts who’ve expressed concerns that health officials are lifting restrictions several months too early ― the changes are unsettling. For many of the millions of Americans who are immunocompromised (or caring for someone who is) and those who are more vulnerable to COVID risks, this is a moment of abject fear — one that comes after two years of feeling left out of pandemic messaging and public health measures. “These changes have created a lot of confusion and a lot of worry,” said Dr. Gary Lyman, a cancer doctor and researcher with UW Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who has been studying the impact the pandemic has had on cancer patients and cancer care. “I’m seeing patients who are feeling what I can only describe as despair.” Experts who work with immunocompromised people say that if you are at a lower risk for severe COVID, it’s on you to consider how your words and actions affect the millions of others whose lives depend on mitigating that risk. Here are some manners and best practices to keep in mind as the world moves forward in the pandemic. First, it’s important to keep in mind that the new Centers for Disease Control mask guidelines do not say that people can drop masks altogether. If you’re in an area with low community levels of COVID (and here’s how you can find out) you should wear a mask based on your personal preference and personal risk, the agency says. If you are in an area with medium levels, you should mask up if you’re immunocompromised or live with someone at high risk of severe illness. And if you’re in an area with high community levels, everyone should be masking up. All of us should be ready to pivot as needed, health officials say. But if you’re in an area with low levels of COVID and you see someone masking, you should not assume they’re doing so because they’re making a statement or virtue signaling. Immune issues are often invisible to others, and it’s no one’s responsibility to share their health details with anyone else. “I would ask the population to not politicize people wearing masks ... we don’t know what people are burdened with,” said Steven Tovian, a clinical professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences with the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. “They may need to wear a mask and they have the right to do that. They’re not making a political statement. They’re trying to save their lives.” Yes, omicron was generally “milder” and is waning. But that doesn’t stop COVID from posing a significant risk to those with weakened immune systems. (We also don’t know much about long COVID effects following an infection, regardless of your health or vaccination status.) Health officials now say that many immunocompromised adults need three shots to be considered fully vaccinated, and a fourth to be considered boosted. Even then, there are questions about how much protection they really have. “Many of the patients I’ve interacted with question: Are we rushing this too quickly? Will there be another surge as all of these mandates and protections are put aside?” Lyman said. “All of this fear and sense of abandonment among those who are the most vulnerable is very real.” Aim for empathy, even through our collective pandemic fatigue. Ranak Trivedi, a clinical health psychologist with Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, urged people who are not immunocompromised to try and remember how uncertain everything felt early on in 2020. That’s still the emotional reality for many today. “There were no vaccinations. We didn’t understand the disease, and everybody went into lockdown. Connecting back with the stress and anxiety we felt as a way to empathize with people would be great,” Trivedi said. Again, vaccines don’t provide the same level of protection to those who have weakened immune systems as they do to everyone else. Studies suggest that up to a quarter of people who have a weakened immune system have no antibody response after three doses of the vaccine. Also, remember that children under 5 are not eligible for vaccines yet — and some people who are immunocompromised are unable to get vaccinated because of their health status. “There’s a lot of uncertainty around what’s coming next for them. And that uncertainty causes a lot of things,” Trivedi said. “It causes anxiety, it causes anger, upset and frustration for people who are able to get vaccinated but who chose not to or who chose not to take other precautions like wearing masks. It can cause isolation, because people then feel fear of being in big groups or settings.” That’s why a layered approach to prevention has been important throughout the pandemic. While one-way masking does provide some level of protection, it’s not the same as when everyone masks together. Again, for many, the easing of COVID restrictions after two-plus years is a happy change. But that’s not a universal feeling. Mental health experts really worry that people who are immunocompromised will feel even more isolated now than they have before as they see friends and loved ones going on vacations, reconnecting at parties and generally heading back out into the world. “Instead of celebrating it and flaunting it and posting pictures, or saying things like, ‘At least we don’t have to worry about it anymore,’ remember that that’s not true for everyone,” said Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist and Columbia University professor. “Just a little bit of sensitivity goes a long way.” While you shouldn’t be pushy about why someone is wearing a mask or ask personal questions about their health status, it is important to be open about your own behaviors if someone who you know is immunocompromised asks. Be prepared to tell them what you’ve been doing and whether you’re vaccinated and boosted. Be forthcoming with the information they need to help keep themselves safe. For example, people who are immunocompromised are accustomed to asking others if they’re sick and might be infectious before they meet face to face, Tovian said. But you can help by offering that information up front. Don’t underestimate how important connection is right now. Social isolation was a massive public health problem even before the pandemic. Try and find ways to spend time together that feel safe to them. “You can ask: ‘How can we meet and connect so that you feel comfortable, but also so I get to spend time with you?’” Trivedi said. “It’s about meeting people on their terms without judgment.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations. Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost"
4,These KN95 Covid Face Masks Are Half Off For A Limited Time,coronavirus," Shopping Writer for HuffPost Even though mask mandates are lifting in many places across the country, the virus that causes COVID-19 has proven to be an unpredictable force. Whether because new variants are possible or the evolving CDC recommendations, it’s a good idea to still have masks on hand. These contoured KN95 masks feature a five-layer design, which the manufacturer claims can block 95% or more of airborne particles in varying sizes. Two non-woven layers and two layers of melt-blown fabric are finished with a soft, skin-friendly inner layer for comfortable wear. An adjustable noseband and soft, flexible ear elastics help keep masks secure and provide a customizable fit. Originally priced at $42.99, you can get 60 individually wrapped masks for half off right now. We don’t know how long this deal will last, so snag them while you can. It’s worth mentioning that although the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health tests and approves N95 masks, making them a great resource for spotting counterfeit respirators, they don’t test or approve KN95s, the widely available Chinese version of the American N95. Reviewers on Amazon who purchased these masks said they could attest to the five-ply protective design and felt the masks provided protection at an economical cost.

5,6 Lawmakers Barred From SOTU After Testing Positive For COVID,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Several lawmakers missed attending Tuesday’s State of the Union address because of a COVID-19 testing requirement ― some because they complied and tested positive for the virus and others because they refused to get tested. Lawmakers had to test negative for the virus, regardless of vaccination status, in order to attend the in-person event. The requirement came as the House lifted its mask mandate on Monday, making face coverings optional. Six Democrats consequently said they tested positive Monday and would skip the event. Those legislators were: Sen. Alex Padilla of California, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington, Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida and Rep. Dwight Evans of Pennsylvania. Raskin, Aguilar and Deutch said they were experiencing only mild symptoms. The others said they were asymptomatic. A handful of Republican lawmakers also skipped attending President Joe Biden’s speech, but because they refused to get tested. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Monday that he wouldn’t attend the event because he didn’t have “time” to get tested. “I only take a test if I’m sick,” he told HuffPost’s Igor Bobic. Rubio further complained about the testing requirement during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. “For the first time in American history you now have people having to produce paper to go in somewhere, to sit somewhere, to go to the State of the Union,” he told attendees. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) announced on Twitter that they would not be attending because of the test requirement. “I’m healthy, so I won’t be taking a test for COVID,” Massie tweeted. Reps. Mary Miller (Ill.), Bob Good (Va.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.) and Andrew Clyde (Ga.) also said they were refusing the testing requirement, according to The Daily Caller.

7,"COVID Cases, Deaths Continue To Fall Globally, WHO Reports",coronavirus," GENEVA (AP) — The number of new coronavirus cases reported globally dropped by 16% last week, marking a month-long decline in COVID-19 infections, according to figures from the World Health Organization. In its weekly report on the pandemic issued late Tuesday, the U.N. health agency also said that deaths fell by 10%, continuing a drop in fatalities first seen last week. WHO said there were more than 10 million new cases and about 60,000 deaths globally. The Western Pacific was the only region where COVID-19 increased, with about a third more infections than the previous week. Deaths rose by 22% in the Western Pacific and about 4% in the Middle East, while declining everywhere else. WHO said the omicron variant remains overwhelmingly dominant worldwide; among virus sequences shared with the world’s largest publicly accessible database, more than 99.5% were omicron while only 0.3% were delta. In the last month, none of the other worrying variants — including beta, gamma, lambda or mu — have been reported, although WHO said there were surveillance challenges in many countries. Numerous countries across Europe including Britain, Sweden  and Denmark, have released nearly all their COVID-19 restrictions as cases have fallen dramatically while immunization campaigns have progressed. In the U.S., scientists have estimated about 73% of the population is now immune to omicron and that any future spikes of disease will require far less disruptive interventions to control epidemics. Still, WHO has repeatedly said it is too early to declare the pandemic over and warned that if the coronavirus is allowed to continue spreading, it will have further chances to mutate into a potentially more deadly or transmissible version. ___ Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic"
8,Biden: More Free COVID Tests Available Next Week,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The White House will expand its free COVID-19 testing program, President Joe Biden announced in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, promising to ramp up supplies just as many of the initial round of federally provided tests near their expiration dates. Starting next week, additional at-home tests will be available on COVIDtests.gov, including to U.S. households that already received their allotted four tests. The administration said it had already sent out 270 million tests to 68 million households since announcing the program over a month ago, with more than 45 million orders placed the first day the federal website came online. But some deliveries took weeks to arrive through the U.S. Postal Service, and 500 million tests — roughly 46% of the stockpile — went unordered, The Associated Press reported Monday. Now many are nearing expiration dates as early as March. “On testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free,” Biden said. “Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from COVIDtests.gov starting next week.” The United States, where vaccinations have become a theater of culture war politics, suffered more deaths from COVID-19 than any other country by far, with the death toll reaching more than 952,000 as of February. But after a flare-up of cases and deaths from the highly infectious omicron variant throughout the winters, numbers have significantly fallen in recent weeks. In response, U.S. policymakers from some of the country’s most populous cities and states recently began easing restrictions requiring masks in public, indoor spaces.

9,CDC Estimates More Than 140 Million Americans Have Had COVID So Far,coronavirus," National Reporter, HuffPost Blood samples collected and tested from the beginning of the pandemic through the end of January 2022 indicate that more than 140 million Americans have had COVID-19 so far, equivalent to roughly 43.3% of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The “nationwide antibody seroprevalence” survey uses data from over 71,000 samples taken across the country throughout the pandemic to estimate the spread of COVID-19 over time. It doesn’t include people in the U.S. who have been vaccinated, a figure the CDC says stands at 64.9% ― though that depends on how it’s defined. It also excludes Arizona, North Dakota, Nevada and Utah, none of which submitted enough samples to be statistically significant. Notably, the survey looks only at the presence of detectable antibodies, not the amount of antibodies present. As such, it’s not an accurate count of the percent of the U.S. population with sufficient antibodies to prevent reinfection. The prevalence varies significantly by age: While an estimated 57.8% of children under the age of 18 have likely had COVID-19, the figure for people age 65 and over is just 23%. For people between the ages of 50 and 64, the figure is 37.1%; for age 18 to 49, it’s 48%. The survey also comes with more than a few caveats. It’s impossible to sort out people who have been infected more than once, for instance. It’s also difficult to account for people who have been infected but were asymptomatic and/or went untested. The survey also relies on samples through the end of January, meaning a significant number of cases caused by the highly transmissible omicron variant have gone uncounted. Among other large, high-income countries like Australia, Japan and Canada, the United States ranks last in vaccinations. It makes sense, then, that the U.S. far outpaced those countries in deaths during the omicron wave. National Reporter, HuffPost"

0,5 New Things Experts Just Figured Out About COVID,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost What we know about COVID-19 seems to change by the minute. It’s understandable, given the massive scale of the pandemic. More than 437 million cases have been confirmed around the world since tracking began. And even now — after two full years living with the coronavirus — the virus and ways to address it are still relatively new to the medical world, so researchers are learning as they go. Still, the amount of information about the coronavirus is dizzying. It’s hard to keep track of what’s known, what’s a myth and which guidance we should follow. That’s why HuffPost has rounded up five of the most important new things we learned about COVID-19 in February. In late February, we got new data about how well the Pfizer vaccine — the only COVID vaccine approved for children ages 5 to 11 — held up in that age group during New York City’s omicron surge. Unfortunately, that data suggests the vaccine was much less effective at preventing infection in 5- to 11-year-olds, who receive a much smaller dose than adolescents, teens and adults. Estimated vaccine effectiveness dropped from 68% to just 12% six weeks later, the study found. Still, it is critical to keep in mind that the vaccine remained protective against severe disease, the researchers wrote. Also, the overall risk of hospitalization among children remains low. Between 0.1% and 1.5% of current COVID infections nationally result in hospitalization, according to the most recent estimates. Still, the researchers who conducted the study argue their findings highlight an urgent need to keep studying — and potentially tweaking — vaccine dosing for young children. Trials for children under 5, using smaller doses of the Pfizer shot, are still ongoing. Kids that age are not yet eligible for COVID vaccines. In the meantime, the researchers emphasized that a layered approach to prevention — one that includes mask-wearing in public settings — is key. The origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been a source of controversy and political strife since the start of the pandemic. But two preliminary research papers released last month strengthen the case that the virus originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China — not in a lab. These papers have not yet been subjected to peer review, so they should be regarded with caution. Still, as The New York Times was the first to report, the researchers analyzed virus genes, maps of the market and social media activity of the earliest COVID-19 patients in the area. All of that evidence suggests the virus was present in live animals sold at the market and “spilled over” into people who worked or shopped there. While many experts caution that we still do not know definitively how the virus initially spread, the papers add to growing evidence that points to live animals, not human engineering. Ultimately, understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is important because it may help prevent future pandemics, experts say. Public health experts have largely provided a reassuring view of risks associated BA.2, the relatively new omicron variant that appears even more transmissible than the previous strain and that could become the dominant variant in the United States. Initial reports show that it is not more likely than the initial omicron variant to cause severe illness or death. Yet data published in February suggests that people who’ve been infected with the initial omicron strain are at risk of reinfection from BA.2 — sometimes not long after their initial infection. Researchers in Copenhagen looked at a pool of 187 people who’d been reinfected with COVID and found that 47 had been infected with BA.2 less than two months after they’d gotten BA.1. Most of the cases were in young, unvaccinated people and resulted in mild illness. “Omicron BA.2 reinfections do occur shortly after BA.1 infections,” the researchers wrote, “but are rare.” Also, though reinfection is certainly possible, it’s important to remember that measures that helped protect people against earlier versions of the virus — like vaccines, masking and social distancing — continue to be effective now. A study published in the journal BMJ in February found that people who had COVID were 35% more likely to develop anxiety disorders, and were approximately 40% more likely to experience depression or sleep disorders within the year after their diagnosis. They were also more likely to grapple with alcohol dependence and opioid use. The reasons why aren’t fully understood. There is an established, bidirectional link between severe COVID and certain mood disorders, so people who have those disorders are at greater risk of severe illness, and those with severe illness are at greater risk of mood issues after the fact. The psychological toll of the pandemic itself and of dealing with symptoms are believed to play a role. But experts increasingly believe COVID may have a direct impact on the brain, disturbing certain pathways that can contribute to mental health disorders. An unsettling paper published in February found that people’s risk of heart disease climbs for at least a year after COVID infection, even for those who have relatively mild cases. Notably, the study found that the risk increased in people under age 65 (who in general are at lower risk of heart issues) and in those who don’t have other risk factors, like obesity or diabetes. “It doesn’t matter if you are young or old, it doesn’t matter if you smoked, or you didn’t,” study co-author Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University in St. Louis, warned in Nature. “The risk was there.” The new study is far from the first to show that COVID infection can hurt the heart in the months after infection, although experts have not gone so far as to recommend that heart screenings become a routine part of follow-up care for those infected with the virus. Still, it is important to be on the lookout for red flags. According to the American Heart Association, those can include “increasing or extreme shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, swelling of the ankles, heart palpitations or an irregular heartbeat, not being able to lie flat without shortness of breath, waking up at night short of breath, lightheadedness or dizzy spells.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,Biden To Give First State Of The Union Address At Fraught Moment,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Facing disquiet at home and danger abroad, President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address at a precipitous moment for the nation, aiming to navigate the country out a pandemic, reboot his stalled domestic agenda and confront Russia’s aggression. The speech Tuesday night had initially been conceived by the White House as an opportunity to highlight the improving coronavirus outlook and rebrand Biden’s domestic policy priorities as a way to lower costs for families grappling with soaring inflation. But it has taken on new significance with last week’s Russian invasion of Ukraine and nuclear saber-rattling by Vladimir Putin. Biden, in his remarks, planned to highlight the bravery of Ukrainian defenders and the resolve of a newly reinvigorated Western alliance that has worked to rearm the Ukrainian military and impose sanctions on Russia to cripple its economy. Biden would speak to “the importance of the United States as a leader in the world, standing up for values, standing up for global norms, but also the efforts that he has undertaken to mitigate how it will impact people here,” press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Biden will address a mostly full and mask-optional crowd in the House chamber, one sign of the easing coronavirus threat. But he’ll also speak from within a newly fenced Capitol due to renewed security concerns after last year’s insurrection. Rising energy prices as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine risk exacerbating inflation in the U.S., which is already at the highest level in 40 years, eating into the earnings of Americans and threatening the country’s economic recovery from the pandemic. And while the geopolitical crisis in Eastern Europe may have helped to cool partisan tensions in Washington, it can’t erase the political and cultural discord that is casting doubt on Biden’s ability to deliver on his pledge to promote national unity. Biden will take the speaker’s rostrum as Americans are frustrated with his performance as president. A February AP-NORC poll found that more people disapproved than approved of how Biden is handling his job as president, 55% to 44%. That’s down from a 60% favorable rating last July. White House officials acknowledge that the mood of the country is “sour,” citing the lingering pandemic and inflation as sources of blame. Biden, in his speech, will highlight the progress from a year ago — with the majority of the country now vaccinated and millions more people at work — but also acknowledge that the job is not yet done, a recognition of American discontent. Biden aides say they believe the national psyche is a “trailing indicator” and will improve with time. But time is running short for the president, who needs to salvage his first-term agenda to revive the political fortunes of his party ahead of November’s midterm elections. The president was set to highlight investments in everything from broadband access to bridge construction from November’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, holding it up as an example of government reaching consensus and delivering change for the American people. He also planned to appeal to lawmakers to reach a compromise on rival competitiveness bills that have passed the House and Senate, both meant to revitalize high-tech American manufacturing and supply chains in the face of growing geopolitical threats from China. The speech comes as progress on many of Biden’s other legislative priorities remains stalled on Capitol Hill, after Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin scuttled the sweeping “Build Back Better” spending bill that Biden championed last fall. As part of his pitch to voters, Biden will aim to resurrect components of the legislation, but with a new emphasis on how proposals like extending the child tax credit and bringing down child care costs could bring relief to families as prices rise. He was also set to lay out how his climate change proposals would cut costs for lower- and middle-income families and create new jobs. “The president will absolutely use the word inflation tomorrow and he will talk about inflation in his speech,” said Psaki. But she emphasized that Biden was focused on “how people experience it” rather than looking at it as a statistic. As part of that push, Biden is expected to call for lowering Americans’ health care costs, pitching his plan to authorize Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, as well as an extension of more generous health insurance subsidies now temporarily available through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces where 14.5 million get coverage. While prospects for congressional passage were slim, Biden also was set to appeal for actions around voting rights, gun control and police reform, which have been hamstrung despite his Democratic majority. Biden was expected to showcase what he’s done so far — for example, acting to crack down on “ghost guns,” homemade firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. On voting rights, legislation stalled after Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema denied Senate Democrats the chance to use a workaround that would allow them to pass the bills with their thin 50-50 majority instead of the 60 votes normally required. The voting legislation written by congressional Democrats would bring in the biggest overhaul of the U.S. elections in a generation by striking down hurdles to voting enacted in the name of election security. Republicans say the changes are not aimed at fairness but at giving Democrats an advantage in elections. Biden will also push the Senate to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. He nominated her last week. Ahead of the speech, the physician’s office for Congress announced that it was lifting the House’s face-covering requirement after the federal government eased its guidelines for mask wearing. Now, mask wearing will be a personal choice in the House chamber, which will be open to all members of Congress, but still no guests. All those who attend will be required to take a COVID-19 test before Biden’s address. Biden aims to use his remarks to highlight progress made against COVID-19 over the last year and to guide the country into a “new phase” of the virus response that looks more like pre-pandemic life. Seating for Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress, last April, was capped at about 200 people — about 20% of usual capacity for a presidential presentation. White House aides fretted that a repeat this year would have been a dissonant image from the message the president aims to deliver to the American people. “I think you’re going to see it look much more like a normal State of the Union, ” said White House chief of staff Ron Klain. “It’s going to look like the most normal thing people have seen in Washington in a long time.” While masks are coming off, law enforcement officials reinstalled a fence around the Capitol building. There were no specific or credible threats ahead of Biden’s speech, but there had been concerns about trucker convoys heading to Washington to protest pandemic restrictions. ___ Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.

2,"California, Oregon, Washington To End School Mask Mandates",coronavirus," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Schoolchildren in California, Oregon and Washington will no longer be required to wear masks as part of new indoor mask policies the Democratic governors of all three states announced jointly on Monday. “With declining case rates and hospitalizations across the West, California, Oregon and Washington are moving together to update their masking guidance,” the governors said in a statement. The new guidance will make face coverings a recommendation rather than a requirement at most indoor places in California starting Tuesday and at schools on March 12, regardless of vaccination status. In Washington and Oregon, all the requirements will lift on March 12. Federal mask requirements will still apply in high-risk indoor settings such as public transportation, airports and taxis. Rules for other high-risk indoor settings could also vary by state. The milestone, two years in the making, comes as much of the country relaxes public health orders, including school mask mandates, in an effort to restore normalcy and boost economic recovery as Americans learn to live with the virus. “Two years ago today, we identified Oregon’s first case of COVID-19,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said in the statement. “On the West Coast our communities and economies are linked. Together, as we continue to recover from the Omicron surge, we will build resiliency and prepare for the next variant and the next pandemic.” Earlier this month, California became the first state to formally shift to an endemic approach to the coronavirus with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement of a plan that emphasizes prevention and quick reaction to outbreaks over mandated masking and business shutdowns. Newsom has come under growing pressure from Republicans and other critics to ease the school mandate, which has increasingly become a polarizing issue among parents in California. While many parents still support wearing masks in schools, others have questioned why it’s necessary when they no longer are required to do so in supermarkets and elsewhere. On Feb. 15 California ended an indoor mask requirement for vaccinated people, but at that time left the rule in place for the unvaccinated and for schoolchildren. Starting Tuesday in California, masks will no longer be required but “strongly recommended” for unvaccinated individuals in most indoor settings. The same shift will apply to K-12 schools and childcare facilities starting March 12, the statement said. A handful of California school districts have already dropped mask mandates for students in recent weeks in open defiance of the state mandate. The West Coast announcements come after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased the federal mask guidance Friday, essentially saying the majority of Americans don’t need to wear masks in many indoor public places, including schools. The new CDC guidance bases recommendations for restrictions such as masking on a new set of measures, with less focus on positive test results and more on what’s happening at hospitals. Under the new system, the CDC said that more than 70% of Americans live in places where the coronavirus poses a low or medium threat to hospitals and therefore can stop wearing masks in most indoor places. The CDC had endorsed universal masking in schools regardless of virus levels in the community since July, but it now recommends masks in schools only in counties at high risk. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said health officials will announce new guidance for schools next week to give them time to prepare. “Many businesses and families will continue choosing to wear masks,” he said. “As we transition to this next phase, we will continue to move forward together carefully and cautiously.”"
3,CDC To Significantly Ease Pandemic Mask Guidelines Friday,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration will significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines to protect against COVID-19 transmission on Friday, according to two people familiar with the matter, meaning most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday will announce a change to the metrics it uses to determine whether to recommend face coverings, shifting from looking at COVID-19 case counts to a more holistic view of risk from the coronavirus to a community. Under current guidelines, masks are recommended for people residing in communities of substantial or high transmission — roughly 95% of U.S. counties, according to the latest data. The new metrics will still consider caseloads, but also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, which have been markedly improved during the emergence of the omicron variant. That strain is highly transmissible, but indications are that it is less severe than earlier strains, particularly for people who are fully vaccinated and boosted. Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data. The new policy comes as the Biden administration moves to shift its focus to preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19, rather than all instances of infection, as part of a strategy adjustment for a new “phase” in the response as the virus becomes endemic. The two people familiar with the change spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the CDC’s action before the announcement."
4,Florida Surgeon General Confirmed Despite COVID-19 Controversies,coronavirus," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo was confirmed to his position Wednesday, as Senate Republicans approved the nomination of the state’s top doctor over criticism that his opposition to coronavirus mandates is too aligned to the politics of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Ladapo, who was appointed by DeSantis in September, has drawn intense scrutiny over his shared resistance with the governor to COVID-19 mandates for vaccines and masks and other health policies endorsed by the federal government. “People have opinions, I know that things have been pretty politically charged, but I want to assure everyone that I’m really passionate about health, good health,” Ladapo told reporters after his confirmation. “I’ve been consistently talking good health from the beginning of the pandemic, holistically and not in one particular lane, so that’s what I’ll continue doing as the surgeon general.” His confirmation capped a legislative process that had Ladapo appear before two Senate committees for hearings that grew contentious when Democrats accused him of dodging questions and not doing enough to promote vaccines. On Wednesday, Democrats reiterated those concerns and urged Ladapo, who watched the debate from the Senate gallery, to break from the Republican governor. “When you are noncommittal to anything, then the optics are that you’re a yes man,” said Sen. Jason W. B. Pizzo, a Democrat, as he looked in Ladapo’s direction. “And we can’t have the third-largest state in the country’s top doctor being a yes man to a politician.” Through his confirmation, Ladapo described himself as a medical professional married to data, once telling a Democratic senator who pressed him on whether vaccines are effective that “yes or no questions are not that easy to find in science.” He later would say that vaccines have been shown to provide protection against hospitalization and death but waning ability to prevent infections. In one of the hearings, Democrats stormed out of a committee room after saying they weren’t getting answers from the surgeon general. In another, Ladapo refused to disclose whether he had received a coronavirus vaccine, prompting another wave of criticism. The surgeon general, in addition to his coronavirus policies, drew national attention for refusing to wear a mask in the office of state Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat who told him she had a serious medical issue. She later revealed a breast cancer diagnosis. Ladapo released a statement that said he was “saddened” by the news of her illness and wished her “blessings and strength.” In picking Ladapo, DeSantis found a former UCLA doctor and researcher with degrees from Harvard who shared his views against coronavirus mandates. Those same policies have turned DeSantis into one of the GOP’s rising stars as he runs for reelection and flirts with a 2024 presidential bid. “I guess politics is a component of my role, but I’m not here for the politics, I’m here for health,” Ladapo said Wednesday. “It just so happens that the governor and I happen to sort of see things similarly among some major health issues, and that’s good.” ___ Associated Press writer Brendan Farrington contributed to this report.

5,Pregnancy-Related Deaths Climbed In Pandemic's First Year,coronavirus," Pregnancy-related deaths for U.S. mothers climbed higher in the pandemic’s first year, continuing a decades-long trend that disproportionately affects Black people, according to a government report released Wednesday. Overall in 2020, there were almost 24 deaths per 100,000 births, or 861 deaths total — numbers that reflect mothers dying during pregnancy, childbirth or the year after. The rate was 20 per 100,000 in 2019. Among Black people, there were 55 maternal deaths per 100,000 births — almost triple the rate for whites. The report from the National Center for Health Statistics does not include reasons for the trend and researchers said they have not fully examined how COVID-19, which increases risks for severe illness in pregnancy, might have contributed. The coronavirus could have had an indirect effect. Many people put off medical care early in the pandemic for fear of catching the virus, and virus surges strained the health care system, which could have an impact on pregnancy-related deaths, said Eugene Declercq, a professor and maternal death researcher at Boston University School of Public Health. He called the high rates “terrible news’’ and noted that the U.S. has continually fared worse in maternal mortality than many other developed countries. Pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 births climbed from 44 in 2019 to 55 in 2020 among Black people and from 13 to 18 among Hispanics. The 2020 rate among whites, 19 per 100,000 births, was essentially unchanged. Reasons for those disparities are not included in the data. But experts have blamed many factors including differences in rates of underlying health conditions, poor access to quality health care and structural racism. “This is incredibly sad news and especially scary for Black women,’’ said Dr. Laura Riley, OB-GYN chief at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. Dr. Janelle Bolden, an assistant OB-GYN professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said the report is not surprising. “The pandemic has uncovered the disparities in access to care, healthcare quality and delivery. It has also laid bare the lack of support for public health and social agencies that many people rely on for basic needs,'' Bolden said. “These disparities and inadequacies lead to poor care and worse outcomes.” The U.S. maternal mortality rate has more than tripled in 35 years. A decade ago, it was 16 deaths per 100,000 births. It has climbed along with rising rates of obesity, heart disease and cesarean sections, which all increase risks for people giving birth. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

7,Buckingham Palace Issues Update On Queen Elizabeth's Health,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Buckingham Palace released an update on Queen Elizabeth’s health Tuesday, announcing that the 95-year-old was canceling planned virtual engagements for the day. The statement came just two days after it was confirmed that the sovereign had tested positive for COVID-19. “As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the statement said. The palace said Sunday that the queen had tested positive for COVID-19 and “was experiencing mild cold like symptoms,” but that she was expected “to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.” Shortly after the initial statement on Sunday, the royal family’s social media accounts posted two messages on behalf of the queen, which seemed reassuring. Tuesday’s statement, however, became a source of concern for the monarch, who is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee this year. Prior to Queen Elizabeth’s COVID-19 news, Both Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, also tested positive earlier this month. All three members of the royal family are triple vaccinated.

8,"Neil Cavuto Returns To Fox Airwaves, Reveals He Was In ICU With COVID-19",coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Fox News and Fox Business host Neil Cavuto returned to the airwaves on Monday after a weekslong absence, revealing to viewers that he had been battling a life-threatening COVID-19 infection in an intensive care unit. “I did get COVID again. But a far, far more serious strand. What doctors call COVID pneumonia. It landed me in intensive care for quite a while and it really was touch and go,” Cavuto said on Fox Business’ “Coast to Coast.” “Some of you who wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for. So, sorry to disappoint you,” he added, apparently referring to death threats and abuse he received last year after encouraging viewers to get vaccinated. He did so after he suffered a breakthrough COVID-19 infection in October. The veteran anchor has multiple sclerosis and a heart condition, and survived stage 4 cancer, which compromises his body’s ability to develop immunity and receive the full benefits of the vaccine. Fox News/Business host Neil Cavuto explains on air that he was out for a while because he was hospitalized with Covid, adds, ""doctors say that had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn't be here.""""I'm not here to debate vaccinations for you. Just offer an explanation for me."" pic.twitter.com/DwI5dKZAL3 He had been missing from Fox airwaves since Jan. 11, according to Mediaite. In October and on Monday, he credited the vaccine for saving his life. “Because I’ve had cancer and right now I have multiple sclerosis, I’m among the vulnerable 3 percenters or so of the population that cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine,” he said. “In other words, it simply doesn’t last. But let me be clear, doctors say had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn’t be here. It provided some defense, but that is still better than no defense.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Health Officials Warily Eye Rising New BA.2 Omicron Strain,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Health officials are keeping a sharp eye on the COVID-19 omicron subvariant BA.2, which appears to be more contagious than the current BA.1 strain — but its health impacts are still unclear. A new World Health Organization study reported that even as COVID-19 cases are falling, BA.2 accounted for 21.5% of all new omicron cases analyzed worldwide in the first week of February. (Omicron cases accounted for more than 98% of sequenced samples around the globe the previous 30 days.) BA.2 accounted for the majority of cases a week ago in 10 countries, including Denmark, India, China, Guam and the Philippines. Southeast Asia had the highest prevalence of BA.2 (44.7%), and North and South America had the lowest (1%). But the subvariant’s health impacts are still unknown. In some countries where BA.2 is spreading, hospitalizations are still decreasing. In the last week alone, almost 75,000 deaths from #COVID19 were reported to WHO. Dr @mvankerkhove elaborates on Omicron and its sub-lineages transmission and severity ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/w53Z25npx2 A recent study in Japan using hamsters, which hasn’t yet been peer reviewed, found BA.2 was both more transmissible and more pathogenic. Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, a senior fellow of the Federation of American Scientists, called the findings “worrisome” and said WHO should upgrade the strain to a “variant of concern.” But critics cautioned that animal studies are difficult to translate to humans and that so far the increasing number of BA.2 cases doesn’t appear to be boosting serious health effects. Jeremy Kamil, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, pointed out to Newsweek that the real test is happening in the world’s population and evidently “disease severity is considerably less than previously.” He also noted that immunity to BA.1 will “mitigate against, and in most cases fully protect, people from BA.2 infection in the near term.” Tom Peacock, a researcher in the Department of Infectious Diseases at London’s Imperial College, also predicted that any “increased severity” in BA.2 over BA.1 will be “modest.” “If we were re-approaching Delta levels of severity again it would have been clear for a while now,” he said in a tweet. If there is increased severity in BA.2 over BA.1 its going to be modest - if we were re-approaching Delta levels of severity again it would have been clear for a while now. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Queen Elizabeth Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Queen Elizabeth has tested positive for COVID-19, Buckingham Palace confirmed in a statement. The palace added that she was “experiencing mild cold like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.” “She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines,” the palace said. News of the 95-year-old monarch’s diagnosis comes after Clarence House revealed that Prince Charles, 73, tested positive on Feb. 10 and went into self-isolation. A palace source said at the time that Charles had met with the queen “recently,” though she wasn’t displaying symptoms. His wife, Camilla, Duchess of Camilla, also later tested positive. Both Prince Charles, Camilla and Queen Elizabeth are triple vaccinated. Other European royals have recently gotten COVID, including King Felipe VI of Spain, 54, and Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II, 81. Charles previously tested positive for coronavirus in March 2020. His symptoms were mild and he was able to work from home, a spokesperson said at the time. Months later, reports revealed that Prince William had also tested positive around the same time, though his diagnosis was not made public knowledge until November 2020. Throughout the pandemic, members of the British royal family have offered messages of encouragement and solidarity on their social media accounts and in various public engagements. The queen also gave a rare, emotional address to the nation and the commonwealth in April 2020, thanking frontline workers for doing their part and promising better days ahead for all. “We should take comfort that while we have more still to endure, better days will return,” she said. “We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Your Risk Of A Mental Health Disorder Increases After COVID,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating mental health consequences for millions of people around the world, from children still reeling from the impact of extended school closures to older adults who’ve struggled with bouts of profound isolation. New research published this week shines a light on another group of people whose mental health and well-being have been hit particularly hard over the past two years: people infected with COVID-19. The findings, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, suggest that people who had COVID-19 were overall about 60% more likely than those who never caught the disease to be battling serious mental health consequences in the year after their initial recovery. The researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 150,000 adults in the United States who tested positive for the coronavirus between March 2020 and January 2021. They found that those infected with the virus were 35% more likely to develop anxiety disorders and roughly 40% more likely to experience depression or sleep disorders within the year after their diagnosis. Those who developed COVID were also 34% more likely to have an opioid use disorder and 20% more likely to develop a substance use disorder involving drugs or alcohol. “While we’ve all suffered during the pandemic, people who have had COVID-19 fare far worse mentally,” study researcher Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, said in a statement. “We need to acknowledge this reality and address these conditions now before they balloon into a much larger mental health crisis.” Researchers have been aware of the link between COVID and mental health struggles since the early days of the pandemic. A study from the fall of 2020, for example, found that people who had COVID were twice as likely to develop depression, anxiety or dementia in the three months after their diagnosis. The connection appears to be bidirectional, meaning that people with certain mood disorders are at greater risk of developing severe COVID, which is why they were cleared for booster shots before the general public, and that people who are infected are at greater risk of developing mental health issues. The big question is why, and experts believe the answer is multilayered. Certainly the psychological stress of the pandemic may play a significant role, as can the emotional turmoil of coping with an infection and subsequent symptoms that can arise and last for months on end. But experts also increasingly believe that COVID itself may have a direct impact on the brain. “Our findings suggest a specific link between SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID] and mental health disorders,” Al-Aly said. “We’re not certain why this is, but one of the leading hypotheses is that the virus can enter the brain and disturb cellular and neuron pathways, leading to mental health disorders.” Notably, the new BMJ study found that people who’d been infected with the coronavirus were 80% more likely than those who weren’t to be experiencing symptoms of brain fog, such as forgetfulness and confusion. Researchers are still trying to better understand exactly how COVID may cross the central nervous system and affect the brain. There is even some evidence that otherwise healthy people with relatively mild initial infections can experience brain inflammation, though such cases are rare. Millions of people are grappling with symptoms of long-haul COVID, as estimates suggest up to 1 in 4 patients struggles with the condition regardless of the severity of their initial infection. There is an urgent need for expanded support and treatment for those people, including those who have developed mental health concerns. Even before the pandemic, people with mental health disorders slipped through the cracks en masse. More than half of those with mental illnesses do not get treated. But interventions such as therapy and medication can be highly effective, so it is critical to reach out to a primary care physician or mental health professional if you have any concerns. Experts say the need to connect people with mental health support and care is now greater than ever. “People need to know that if they have had COVID-19 and are struggling mentally, they’re not alone, and they should seek help immediately and without shame,” Al-Aly said. If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741-741 for free, 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line.

2,California Adopts Nation's 1st 'Endemic' Virus Policy,coronavirus," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California became the first state to formally shift to an “endemic” approach to the coronavirus with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement Thursday of a plan that emphasizes prevention and quick reaction to outbreaks over mandated masking and business shutdowns. The milestone, nearly two years in the making, envisions a return to a more normal existence with the help of a variety of initiatives and billions in new spending to more quickly spot surges or variants, add health care workers, stockpile tests and push back against false claims and other misinformation. “We are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus,” he said during a news conference from a state warehouse brimming with pandemic supplies in Fontana, east of Los Angeles. The first-term Democrat, who last year survived a recall election driven by critics of his governance during the pandemic, promised the state’s nearly 40 million residents that as the omicron surge fades, “we’re going to keep them safe and we’re going to stay on top of this.” A disease reaches the endemic stage when the virus still exists in a community but becomes manageable as immunity builds. But there will be no definitive turn of the switch, the Democratic governor said, unlike the case with Wednesday’s lifting of the state’s indoor masking requirements or an announcement coming Feb. 28 of when precisely schoolchildren can stop wearing face coverings. And there will be no immediate lifting of the dozens of remaining executive emergency orders that have helped run the state since Newsom imposed the nation’s first statewide stay-home order in March 2020. “This pandemic won’t have a defined end. There’s no finish line,” Newsom said. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and with omicron fading in many parts of the world some countries have begun planning for the endemic stage.  But no state has taken the step Newsom did and offered a detailed forward-looking plan. Republicans have been frequent critics of Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus and were quick to disparage his latest effort. State GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called it “an extra-large helping of word salad” and renewed the call to “follow the lead of other blue states and end his state of emergency or lift his school mask mandate.” Newsom’s plan sets specific goals, such as stockpiling 75 million masks, establishing the infrastructure to provide up to 200,000 vaccinations and 500,000 tests a day in the event of an outbreak, and adding 3,000 medical workers within three weeks in surge areas. Newsom’s administration came up with a shorthand acronym to capsulize key elements of its new approach: SMARTER. The letters stand for Shots, Masks, Awareness, Readiness, Testing, Education and Rx, a reference to improving treatments for COVID-19. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern California, said while some may argue these should have come sooner, he believes “the timing is right on.” “Surveillance, testing, vaccination and treatment make the context very different and make it appropriate to shift our response from a pandemic response of trying to do everything possible, to a more rational response to try to implement things that we have strong evidence that work,” Klausner said. The plan includes increased monitoring of virus remnants in wastewater to watch for the first signs of a surge. Masks won’t be required but will be encouraged in many settings. If a higher level of the virus is detected, health officials will determine if it is a new variant. If so, state and federal officials have a goal to within 30 days determine if it responds to existing tests, treatments and immunities from vaccines or prior infections. California’s health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said one of the goals is to avoid business closures and other far-reaching mandates. However, he said the state’s requirement that schoolchildren be vaccinated against coronavirus by fall remains in effect. The plan includes new education, including “myth-buster videos” to fight misinformation and disinformation and help interpret ever-evolving precautions for a confused public whiplashed by safeguards that seemingly shift by the day and vary across county lines. In coordination with the federal government, it calls for a first-in-the-nation study of the pandemic’s direct and indirect impacts long-term on both people and communities. All this will cost billions, much of it already outlined in the pandemic response package Newsom sought as part of his budget last month. That includes $1.9 million that  lawmakers already approved  to boost staffing at hospitals and increase coronavirus testing and vaccine distribution, as well as existing money and anticipated federal funds. His proposed budget also includes $1.7 billion to beef up the state’s health care workforce, with more investment in increased laboratory testing capacity, data collection and outbreak investigation. Newsom, who has faced criticism for sometimes failing to follow his own rules,  defended keeping in place some of his executive emergency orders, which he said most recently have allowed the state to quickly bring in temporary medical workers and to quickly distribute more than 13 million home test kits to schools. Those orders have dwindled from 561 to fewer than 100 in recent months, he said, and his administration is working with legislative leaders to eventually make them unnecessary."
3,'Going-Out Masks' Are A Thing. Here Are 17 You Need Now.,coronavirus," Staff Writer Early 2000s fashion can be summed up with low-rise pants, tiny purses and ornate, often bedazzled shirts affectionally dubbed “going-out tops.” And as more states scale back COVID-related restrictions on indoor dining and events, the going-out top is making a return. After sitting inside for two years making sourdough and watching Netflix docu-series, people are ready to get out of their house and go out on the town. And of course, because COVID refuses to go away, wearing a proper protective face covering is still a necessary and important part of staying safe. Cue the “going-out mask.” It’s an eye-catching, show-stopping accessory meant to go over an N95 or KN95 mask. Unlike a certified N95 or KN95, a going-out mask is not official PPE. It’s a decorative, ornamental piece that’s purely for adding some color and texture over a mask that’s actually protective. Whether it matches your outfit or adds some new textures to your look, the going-out mask is a way to express yourself and your personal style. From velvet to silk to those with gems and fake flowers, there is a going-out mask for every sort of occasion. Wear it to a wedding or baby shower. Wear it to date night or dancing. Heck, wear it to the grocery store if you’re feeling frisky on a weeknight. Wherever you wear it, make sure you’re wearing it over a certified protective mask to help curb potential transmission and keep yourself and others safe. From embroidered flowers to iridescent masks, we’ve rounded up the best “going-out masks” to complete any outfit. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

4,When You Should Go To The ER If You're Pregnant And Have COVID,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost After seeing two pink lines on a pregnancy test eight months ago, I’ve been excitedly preparing for the arrival of my new baby. But when I tested positive on a different kind of test in my third trimester, my heart sank. At 33 weeks pregnant, I was COVID positive — and absolutely miserable. Pregnancy makes life more difficult for many people, including me. All-day fatigue turns into terrible insomnia at night. Intense cravings lead to heartburn. Pressure from a growing baby causes aches and pains everywhere. So, I was more than a little nervous about how COVID would affect me. This anxiety was not unfounded. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant and recently pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 and more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care or a ventilator to help them breathe. Those with COVID are also more likely to experience preterm birth, stillbirth and other pregnancy complications. One study found that pregnant women who are Hispanic or Black may be disproportionately affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID) during pregnancy. The most important thing that pregnant people who test positive for COVID can do is stay calm. Then, read the advice from doctors on what to do next. The CDC recommends calling your health care professional (if you’re pregnant, that would be your OB-GYN or midwife) within 24 hours of testing positive or showing symptoms of COVID-19. Then, go to the ER if you have any of these emergency warning signs of COVID: Dr. Greg Marchand, a board-certified OB-GYN based in Mesa, Arizona, recommends seeking medical attention if you have a fever that won’t go away for longer than 24 hours, even while taking Tylenol. (NSAIDs like ibuprofen should be avoided in pregnancy.) Additionally, “head to the emergency room if you’re having difficulty breathing or if you’re unable to keep down any liquids for more than four hours,” Marchand advised. “If you’re more than 24 weeks pregnant, you will also want to go in if you don’t feel the baby move.” Dr. Mobola Kukoyi, a board-certified emergency and public health physician based in Illinois, listed decreased fetal movement, decreased urination, chest pain, trouble breathing, persistent nausea and vomiting as red flags that signal a trip to the emergency room. Other warning signs could include extreme swelling of your hands or face, vaginal bleeding or discharge, or severe redness or pain in your arm. Shortness of breath is common during pregnancy. In the first trimester, this is due to an increase in the hormone progesterone. Later pregnancy, it’s caused by the baby getting bigger and pressing on the diaphragm, making it hard for the lungs to fully expand. However, if you feel a sudden onset of shortness of breath or trouble breathing after testing positive for COVID-19, it could be a sign of something more dangerous. “You should go to the emergency room if you have signs such as chest pain or trouble breathing,” Kukoyi said. “If you are having respiratory symptoms, it is recommended that you monitor your home oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter and go to the ER if you consistently have levels below 92%.” It’s important to monitor your breathing, especially during pregnancy, to watch for things like “severe lung infection leading to respiratory distress,” which can be “riskier in pregnancy given the additional demand on the body,” according to Kukoyi. “In addition, pregnancy can cause a hypercoagulable state, meaning the blood can become more prone to forming clots in the lungs and legs,” Kukoyi said. “As COVID can also cause clots, this can theoretically increase risks in pregnancy. Signs of a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) include severe chest pain that worsens with breathing, shortness of breath, or low oxygen levels. Signs of a blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) could be unilateral leg swelling (one bigger than the other), pain and swelling of the leg, especially the calf. When I was sick with COVID during pregnancy, my OB-GYN recommended I go to the emergency room, as I was maintaining a 101-degree fever even after taking fever-reducing medication. The reason? To make sure the baby is staying oxygenated. “The baby gets oxygenated as long as the mother is adequately oxygenated,” Kukoyi explained. “In the ER, we can check the baby’s heart rate to make sure it remains within normal range, as this is usually the first indication of an adverse event. Sometimes, your OB-GYN may be able to perform a more extensive fetal monitoring in the ER for a few hours.” Your doctor will probably also want to make sure your fever doesn’t get too high, as “high-grade fevers may be associated with birth defects, especially in early pregnancy,” Kukoyi said. Luckily, transmission of COVID from a pregnant person to a fetus is rare. My emergency room visit showed my baby had healthy oxygen levels and movement — he wasn’t affected at all by how miserable I was. For pregnant people suffering with COVID symptoms, there are a few ways to ease your discomfort. “Taking Tylenol, staying hydrated with a minimum of 64 ounces of water a day, and getting plenty of rest will be helpful,” Kukoyi said. She also recommended taking a warm bath, as long as it’s not too hot, and using heat packs for muscle pain. “For cold/cough symptoms, use of a humidifier can help,” she added. “You can also discuss what cough medicines can be used to relieve symptoms with your doctor.” “Hydration is important and so is vitamin C intake,” Marchand explained. He also recommends monitoring the baby’s movement and prioritizing rest. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend that all pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19. This is due in part to the evidence of the vaccines’ safe and effective use in pregnant people due to the tens of thousands of reporting individuals. My OB-GYN explained that being vaccinated is why I had a relatively mild case — only experiencing symptoms for about two days before I felt better. Getting vaccinated will also help your unborn baby. A recent study published in JAMA found that the majority of infants born to COVID-vaccinated mothers still had persistent antibodies at 6 months old, compared with infants born to mothers with a COVID infection. If you are pregnant with a COVID infection, or feel something is off, don’t hesitate to call your doctor or visit an emergency room to get checked. At the very least, it will give you peace of mind that everything with the baby is OK. On Assignment For HuffPost"

6,National Guard Deploys For New Emergency: Teacher Shortages,coronavirus," ALAMOGORDO, N.M. (AP) — On past deployments Army National Guard Spc. Michael Stockwell surveilled a desolate section of the U.S.-Mexico border during a migrant surge, and guarded a ring of checkpoints and fences around New Mexico’s state Capitol after the January 2021 insurrection in Washington. On his current mission, Stockwell helps students with assignments as a substitute science teacher at Alamogordo High School. “You can’t act Army with these kids. You can’t speak the same way you would with another soldier with these kids. You can’t treat them the same way. You have to be careful with corrective actions,” he said with a laugh. Dozens of National Guard Army and Air Force troops in New Mexico have been stepping in for an emergency unlike others they have responded to before: the shortage of teachers and school staff members that has tested the ability of schools nationwide to continue operating during the coronavirus pandemic. While many other states and school districts issued pleas for substitute teachers amid omicron-driven surges in infections, New Mexico has been alone in calling out its National Guard members. In 36 of the state’s 89 school districts, guard members have traded in mission briefs for lesson plans to work for school systems. When Stockwell first walked into the freshman science class, wearing camouflage fatigues and combat boots, some students thought he was just visiting, like a recruiter. Then he took a seat in the teacher’s chair. “When he started taking attendance, I was like, ‘whoa,’” said Lilli Terrazas, 15, of Alamogordo. “I was kind of nervous because, like, you know — a man in a uniform. But it was cool. He helped me.” Roughly 80 service members have volunteered to work in schools. The troops have gone through background checks and taken brief courses required for substitute teachers. As substitutes, they don’t have to learn much about curriculum, but they need to be attentive to students. Stockwell has been filling in since late January when his students’ teacher moved to an administrative role in another school. One recent day, he shuffled through the rows of school desks, kneeling to meet students eye-to-eye as he helped them with assignments calculating the depth of the earth’s crust, and other layers of the planet. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called out the guard to help with the acute shortages in a state that like several others  has struggled to find enough educators. At least 100 schools had reported closing down for at least one day this school year. New Mexico saw a surge of teacher retirements last fall, and there are currently around 1,000 open teaching positions in a state with about 20,000 teachers. Grisham stressed the guard deployment is a temporary measure and state officials are working to bolster the teaching force and school staff through increased pay and other strategies. In Alamogordo, the teacher shortage peaked on Jan. 13, when 30 teachers, about a third of the teaching staff, were out due to illness, professional training, or family emergencies. “Everybody was enjoying their holiday and things like that, and then they came back and were sick,” said Raeh Burns, one of two Alamogordo High School secretaries tasked with filling teaching slots each morning. “I know I’m going to have Mr. Stockwell every morning and that he’s OK to go where I need him to go.” In some communities, there have been concerns raised about soldiers going in classrooms. In Santa Fe, the school district was asked if soldiers would wear uniforms and carry guns, school district spokesperson Cody Dynarski said. Guns were always out of the question. The district decided that soldiers would wear civilian clothing. Ultimately, Santa Fe and Albuquerque, two of the largest urban school districts, did not receive any soldiers despite their requests as the deployments have prioritized smaller and more rural school districts. Elsewhere, when given the choice, some soldiers have opted for military fatigues over civilian clothes to command respect in the classroom, particularly if they’re not much older than their students. “I think I look like an 18-year-old out of uniform,” said Cassandra Sierra, 22, of Roswell, N.M., who has served as a substitute teacher in a high school in Hobbs. Sierra already works with kids in her day job as a student coordinator at a military boarding school in Roswell, which has given her an edge as a substitute. “Kids just need patience,” she said. “I think I just have a lot of patience.” At a middle school on Alamogordo’s Holloman Air Force Base, students are used to seeing people in uniform, but not in classrooms. “I was like, ‘Oh, we have somebody in the uniform that’s going to teach us. That’s kinda awkward.’ It was weird,” said Andrew George, 12, of his computer classes led by a woman trained in combat and with experience leading a platoon overseas. “Once she introduced herself I was like ‘Oh yeah, this is going to be fun.’” The substitute, Lt. Amanda Zollo, works in the 911 dispatch center in Albuquerque when she’s not training or serving with the guard. She kept students on task during a lesson about cybersecurity, as they created and then attempted to break each other’s passwords. She was subbing for a teacher who was having trouble finding childcare. The principal, Whitney Anderson, said that having Zollo’s services meant that for the first time that week she didn’t have to take over a classroom herself. Zollo doesn’t talk about her work as an infantry officer with her students, which, after a nervous laugh, she describes as “engaging with and destroying the enemies of the U.S. in close-quarter combat.” ___ Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

7,"Disneyland, Disney World To Lift Mask Mandates For Fully Vaccinated Guests",coronavirus," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Masks will soon be optional for many of those seeking out some Disney magic this year. Officials at Disneyland and Walt Disney World confirmed this week that their mask policies for fully vaccinated guests are being revised. As of Thursday, face coverings “will be optional” for visitors who have received their jabs across all four of Disney World’s theme parks and in both outdoor and indoor locations, according to the Florida resort’s website. Mask protocols at California’s Disneyland are receiving a similar update, with vaccinated visitors permitted to enter indoor attractions, eateries and shops without masks from Thursday onward. Unvaccinated visitors to both the Florida and California resorts will be expected to wear a mask in all indoor settings. Officials, however, have said they will not be checking vaccination records. “As we have done since reopening, we’ve been very intentional and gradual in our approach to our COVID-19 health and safety protocols,” a statement on the Disney parks’ official website reads. “We encourage people to get vaccinated.” Face coverings will still be required for all guests on all park transportation systems in both Disney World and Disneyland, including monorails, buses and parking trams. Disney’s announcement follows similar updates at other popular theme parks, including Universal Studios. The news, however, drew a mixed response on social media. “I had hoped the major theme park players would wait a little longer until the under-age-5 set could get their shots before relaxing, but nope,” one person wrote. Added another, “I want so much to believe that things are getting to the point that we can go without masks ... but I am having trouble doing so. Especially with one who is still too young to get vaxed.” Both Disneyland and Disney World shut down in March 2020 after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Their subsequent reopenings, however, were vastly different and in accordance with their respective states. Disney World reopened in July 2020, whereas Disneyland remained shuttered for more than a year before welcoming its first guests back in April 2021. Though both Disneyland and Disney World initially dropped mask mandates for vaccinated visitors in June 2021, both resorts reinstated the indoor face covering requirement shortly thereafter as a result of the rise of the delta variant of the coronavirus.

8,What COVID Breakthrough Infections Might Look Like In The Future,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost When omicron ripped through the population last month, tons of people who had been fully vaccinated and boosted were surprised to find that ― after two years of avoiding the virus ― they finally tested positive for COVID-19. The highly contagious variant taught us that while the vaccines continue to do an excellent job at protecting most people from serious illness, hospitalization and death, it’s a bit of a different story when it comes to those less severe symptomatic infections. The bulk of breakthrough infections reported during the omicron wave were considered less severe than the infections recorded in people who were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. And early research suggests long COVID is significantly less likely in vaccinated people who have had COVID-19. Some infectious diseases experts expect breakthrough infections to be similar going forward, while others are cautious about guessing how it all will play out. That said, there are some predictions based on previous waves and what we know about COVID-19 now. Most infectious diseases experts aren’t surprised that so many vaccinated people recently tested positive. “The vaccines were not designed to prevent infection. They were designed to prevent severe disease, and they’ve done that extraordinarily well,” said Dr. Jaimie Meyer, a Yale Medicine infectious disease doctor and associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. The vast majority of breakthrough infections — which Meyer prefers to call post-vaccination infections — have been mild. But it’s important to be clear about what mild entails. Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an epidemiologist and professor of infectious diseases with Stanford Medicine, stressed that mild COVID-19 illnesses can be anything from a runny nose for a couple days to being run-down and bedridden for a week. Mild infections essentially involve all the cases where people get sick but don’t end up in the hospital. It’s a wide range. In general, fully vaccinated and boosted people tend to be in the “milder range,” according to Parsonnet, and a lot will be completely asymptomatic. Over the next few months, as we come further off the omicron surge, we’ll likely see a lull in the number of infections occurring. We’ve seen, time and time again, that severe illness is mostly occurring in people who are unvaccinated and partially vaccinated. People who have an underlying immune condition are also more at risk for more serious disease after vaccination — but we also know that the booster provides great protection against severe outcomes in at-risk individuals. Infection mitigation measures, like mask wearing, is also vital. “I expect that pattern will continue, although hopefully, overall, the number of infections will decline — and so the absolute number of post-vaccination infections will decline, too,” Meyer said. A small study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently found that the durability of the booster shot’s protection — specifically when it comes to urgent care and emergency room visits — may dwindle after around four months. But the three-dose series remains highly effective against severe disease over time, a CDC spokesperson told The Associated Press. As antibody levels wane, more people will contract infections, Parsonnet said, but she does not expect those breakthroughs to become more severe over time. Think: runny noses, colds, maybe more diarrhea, she said. Parsonnet is confident that our B cells and T cells — which are also activated when we get vaccinated and part of our long-lasting immune response to infections — will always be able to react really quickly, which lowers the risk of severity. Our T cells are always going to be there — we won’t spontaneously lose that memory. “Once the virus gets into your bloodstream, most people are going to have a really good and effective immune response to that,” she said. These breakthroughs will also keep our immune system primed, in a way, to naturally boost our B cells and T cells that keep us safe from severe illness. “As antibodies wane and vaccines wane, we may see more colds — but I don’t think we’re going to see a big turn back to bad disease,” Parsonnet said. The exception here is with unvaccinated people and certain immunocompromised people who can’t mount strong antibody responses after vaccination — which is why we may see boosters routinely recommended for those at risk. Though not expected right now, there is a chance a new variant could emerge that can outsmart our immunity even more than omicron. “It would take something really incredible to outrun it [completely],” Parsonnet said. If virus transmission accelerates again, we may need another booster, but when that might happen — and how regularly we’ll need a boost — is unknown. When it comes to the variant-specific shots that vaccine manufacturers are currently working on, there are a couple of issues to consider. One, though these tailored shots might target one variant super well, they could be less effective at protecting us from other variants that emerge. This could put selective pressure on the virus, and it could mutate further to work its way around the shot, Meyer said. Two, by the time these variant-specific shots are created, tested, manufactured and distributed, the wave may have already passed (think of how things progressed with alpha, then delta and omicron). We may eventually see new methods of vaccination — like nasal sprays, which can block the virus from attaching to our airways and forming an infection in the first place. What we really want, according to Parsonnet, is a pan-coronavirus vaccine — a shot that will cover all the variants. There are a lot of scientists working on these types of vaccines, but if and when they’ll be ready and available is unclear. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

0,Can I Go Back To 'Normal' After Having A Breakthrough COVID Infection?,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost If you’re fully vaccinated and have recently recovered from COVID, you’re probably wondering if it’s safe to resume some of the riskier activities you may have avoided since the pandemic began. We know that vaccination continues to provide strong protection against hospitalization and death. Throw in the extra immunity conferred from a breakthrough infection and you’re about as protected against the coronavirus as you can get. Infectious diseases specialists have labeled the combination of vaccination plus infection-conferred immunity as “hybrid immunity,” and say it’s the highest form of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are unknowns, like how the protection gained after an omicron infection compares with that of delta. But doctors generally agree that, for some time, vaccinated people who’ve recovered from COVID are likely protected from reinfection and from transmitting the virus to others. The coronavirus will continue to mutate and new variants will likely emerge that could potentially skirt part of our immunity, according to Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Reinfections will eventually happen — even in people with hybrid immunity — but those future infections are likely to be mild, thanks to all the immunity they’ve built. “For those types of people, they should really have no concerns about going back to their normal activities, at least for a period of several months,” Adalja said. “And even after that period, if they are susceptible to getting a reinfection, that reinfection is going to be really mild.” Vaccines provide us with a great immune response specifically targeted at the spike protein on the coronavirus — the part of the virus that attaches to our cells. Evidence shows that vaccine-induced immune response continues to do a great job of keeping people out of the hospital. Scientists are still learning about omicron infections, given that the variant — though now on the decline — is still new. “We tend to think if you’ve been infected, you have a good 90 days of which you are to have some level of protection — and that’s probably the case [with omicron], but we need to be absolutely sure,” said Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine, global health and epidemiology at Emory University. A preprint study from Hong Kong found that breakthrough infections from omicron elicited a broad antibody and T-cell response that works well against other variants — alpha, beta, gamma, delta. The antibodies that your immune system produces during an infection are everywhere in your body, including in the nasal cavity, which is our first line of defense when we inhale virus particles. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance states that recently recovered people are well protected for three months. Some data suggest that protection is even more durable — seven to eight months, sometimes longer, said Adalja. Keep in mind that immunity isn’t a one-size-fits-all sort of thing. Most people with hybrid immunity will have strong resistance against serious illness — including those who have health issues that put them at risk for COVID, like obesity or diabetes, according to Adalja. Individuals who are immunocompromised — including those who’ve had a stem cell or organ transplant — will need to be safeguarded, since some may not mount a strong immune response after vaccination or infection. For others without underlying issues, antibody levels will wane over time and reinfections will occur (just as they do with other respiratory viruses). “Don’t assume that just because you got infected once, you won’t get it again,” del Rio said. Still, cell-mediated immunity will continue to protect most people from severe disease, hospitalization and death. We aren’t in a place where life will be like it was before the pandemic. Everyone will still have to look at their own risk tolerance. The vast majority of people with hybrid immunity are going to have incredible protection against COVID, especially when it comes to severe outcomes, for several months. Because of this, people with hybrid immunity can feel a bit safer doing indoor activities in the immediate future, said Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist at University of California, San Francisco. People who are severely immunocompromised will always have to be careful, similar to how they were advised to behave in prior respiratory virus seasons, Adalja said. If this is you, continue to take protective precautions. Everyone in the entire population also has a responsibility to look after those who are immunocompromised, even after they’ve recovered from a breakthrough infection. This means taking measures to ensure their safety, like wearing masks in public and around those you know who are at risk, getting boosted (or vaccinated) if you haven’t already, and avoiding contact with people if have any signs of illness. Those who’ve been relying on rapid tests to visit at-risk family members can probably have some peace of mind during the initial weeks after they have recovered, del Rio added. “But if you have access to tests, test yourself,” he said. Since we aren’t going to be able to eliminate the coronavirus, we all will likely remain at risk to contract it throughout our lifetimes, according to Adalja. The goal now, he said, is to keep any such illness mild. This primarily is done through vaccination and boosting. Hybrid immunity also can contribute (but, obviously, don’t try to get infected on purpose or throw all caution to the wind). Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

1,Canada Judge Blocks Money For Truckers From U.S. Right-Wing Christian Fundraising Site,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A Canadian judge has issued an injunction blocking money for the anti-vaccine trucker protesters in Ottawa collected by the right-wing U.S. Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo. The Ontario government petitioned for the order from Canada’s Superior Court of Justice, which was issued Thursday. It prohibits “any and all parties with possession or control over these donations” from distributing the money. The criminal code allows for such an action against any “offense-related property,” meaning assets collected as part of or supporting illegal activity, according to a spokesperson for Ontario Premier Doug Ford. GiveSendGo defiantly declared in response to the court order: “Know this! Canada has absolutely ZERO jurisdiction over how we manage our funds here at GiveSendGo.” GiveSendGo has raised some $9 million for the “Freedom Convoy” and via the site’s “Adopt a Trucker” program. The site also encourages “prayers” for the controversial trucker “warriors” in their third week of protesting against vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 precautions at the U.S.-Canadian border. GiveSendGo has raised money for several far-right causes, and even for violent organizations, including the extremist Proud Boys, which is classified as a “terrorist” organization in Canada. Trucker protest leader Chris Barber ominously threatened that the judge’s order would “blow up in their faces” in an interview with The Ottawa Citizen. “Bring it on ... we are not going anywhere,” added Barber, who insisted there’s money coming in from other sources. Here's the wording of the injunction issued yesterday freezing GiveSendGo ""Freedom Convoy"" donations. (GiveSendGo has said ""Canada has absolutely ZERO jurisdiction over how we manage our funds"" and I guess Ontario Superior Court disagrees.) pic.twitter.com/KVZK8qMFpd The order was part of a multipronged attack this week against the truckers who have paralyzed downtown Ottawa and blocked a key bridge into the U.S. A province-wide state of emergency was declared Wednesday and police on Saturday began enforcing an injunction against the truckers’ blockade of the Ambassador Bridge from Windsor, Ontario into Detroit. The blockade choked off an already challenged supply chain to American automakers. A report estimated that U.S. workers and businesses have already lost some $51 million in damaged commerce and wages due to the action. By late Saturday, blockade trucks on the bridge were gone in the wake of the police action, though protesters on foot remained, The Detroit Free Press reported. The anti-precautions protest began more than two weeks ago as hundreds of truckers, many driving massive semi-trucks, descended on downtown Ottawa, honking ear-piercing air horns, paralyzing traffic and shutting down stores and offices. They’ve been accused of harassment, even assault, and of ripping masks off the faces of area residents. Yet the truckers were immediately hailed as heroes by right-wing American lawmakers and others, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Florida’s GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, Elon Musk, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Donald Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. GoFundMe earlier this month shut down a site that had raised close to $10 million for the truckers after Ottawa police reached out to the company to complain of illegal activity by the truckers. That’s when GiveSendGo stepped in. Members of Ontario’s House of Commons this week heard testimony from deputy directors of Canada’s financial intelligence operation revealing that it doesn’t directly track sources of money pouring into crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe or GiveSendGo GlobalNews reported. Representatives from GoFundMe will reportedly testify before a committee next week about what measures it has taken to prevent being a funding conduit to extremists. Michael Kempa, an associate criminology professor at the University of Ottawa, views the truckers’ anti-vaccine fight largely as cover for a deeply authoritarian movement funded by American and global interests out to undermine the rule of law and Canada’s government. Canada Unity, one of the organizers of the trucker protest, has called for the dissolution of Canada’s Parliament. “They’re people interested in undoing the conventional state system, and replacing the Canadian democratic model with something that is much more grassroots authoritarian and far-right conservative,” Kempa told CBC-TV in an interview. “They’re not interested in the ... liberal system we have here in Canada.” Major Canadian trucker associations have disavowed the protesters, saying the vast majority of drivers are vaccinated and are continuing to work.

2,Canada Border Blockade Clearing Peacefully After Police Move In,coronavirus," WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) — A tense standoff at a U.S.-Canadian border crossing crucial to both countries’ economies appeared to be dissolving peacefully Saturday as Canadian police moved in to disperse the nearly weeklong blockade and protesters began leaving without resistance. Many demonstrators drove away from the Ambassador Bridge spanning the river between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, as scores of police approached shortly after dawn. They had spent the night there in defiance of new warnings to end the blockade, which disrupted the flow of traffic and goods and forced the auto industry on both sides to roll back production. Surrounded by dozens of officers, a man with “Mandate Freedom” and “Trump 2024″ spray-painted on his vehicle left as other protesters began dismantling a small tarp-covered encampment. A trucker honked his horn as he, too, drove off, to cheers and chants of “Freedom!” More protesters arrived to the area by late morning, though, carrying flags and yelling. Police continued to back people away from the bridge, and there were no visible physical confrontations. The demonstrations at the Ambassador Bridge, downtown Ottawa and elsewhere have targeted vaccine mandates and other coronavirus restrictions and vented fury toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has called the protesters a “fringe” of Canadian society. The protests have reverberated outside the country, with similarly inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that truck protests may be in the works in the United States. Windsor police tweeted that no one had been arrested as of mid-morning but urged people to stay away from the bridge: “We appreciate the cooperation of the demonstrators at this time and we will continue to focus on resolving the demonstration peacefully. Avoid area!” Daniel Koss was among those who stayed overnight. Shortly before police advanced, he said the protest had succeeded in bringing attention to demands to lift COVID-19 mandates and he was happy it remained peaceful. “It’s a win-win,” Koss said. “The pandemic is rolling down right now, they can remove the mandates, all the mandates, and everyone’s happy. The government does the right thing, and the protesters are all happy.” He said he believed most people would disperse in an orderly fashion, “because we don’t want to cause a big problem.” The previous day, a judge ordered an end to the blockade of mostly pickup trucks and cars, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency allowing for fines of 100,000 Canadian dollars and up to one year in jail for anyone illegally blocking roads, bridges, walkways and other critical infrastructure. “The illegal blockades are impacting trade, supply chains & manufacturing. They’re hurting Canadian families, workers & businesses. Glad to see the Windsor Police & its policing partners commenced enforcement at and near the Ambassador Bridge,” Federal Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne tweeted Saturday. “These blockades must stop.” The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. The standoff came at a time when the auto industry is already struggling to maintain production in the face of pandemic-induced shortages of computer chips and other supply-chain disruptions. In the capital, Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency last week after thousands of protesters descended on the city. Their numbers have dwindled but hundreds of trucks remain parked in front of the Parliament Buildings, and demonstrators have set up portable toilets where Trudeau’s motorcade usually parks outside the prime minister’s office. Protesters on Saturday tore down a fence that authorities put up around the National War Memorial two weeks ago after demonstrators urinated on it. Some demonstrators later chanted “liberte,” French for “freedom,” as police watched. Police issued a statement calling the Ottawa protest an unlawful occupation and saying they were waiting for “reinforcements” before implementing a plan to end the demonstration. The statement did not elaborate. While the protesters are decrying vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 restrictions, many of Canada’s infection measures, such as mask rules and vaccine passports for getting into restaurants and theaters, are already falling away as the omicron surge levels off. Pandemic restrictions have been far stricter in Canada than in the U.S., but Canadians have largely supported them. The vast majority of Canadians are vaccinated, and the COVID-19 death rate is one-third that of the United States. Protests inspired by the Canadian demonstrations were seen in parts of Europe on Saturday. At least 500 vehicles in several convoys attempted to enter Paris at key arteries but were intercepted by police. Over 200 motorists were ticketed, and elsewhere at least two people were detained amid a seizure of knives, hammers and other objects in a central square. Police fired tear gas against a handful of people who demonstrated on the Champs Elysees Avenue in defiance of a police order. Some 7,000 officers have been mobilized for the weekend protesters, who are railing against the vaccination pass that France requires to enter restaurants and many other venues. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, dozens of trucks and other vehicles ranging from tractors to a car towing a camping van arrived in The Hague, blocking an entrance to the historic parliamentary complex. Protesters on foot joined them, carrying a banner emblazoned with “Love & freedom, no dictatorship” in Dutch. Earlier this week in New Zealand, protesters rolled up to Parliament grounds in a convoy of cars and trucks and set up camp. Police have taken a hands-off approach after initial attempts to remove them resulted in physical confrontations. Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard on Friday ordered his staff to turn on the lawn’s sprinklers to douse them and to play Barry Manilow tunes and the 1990s hit “Macarena” over loudspeakers to annoy them. Protesters responded by playing their own songs, including Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It.” ____Householder reported from Windsor, and Gillies from Toronto.

3,"Manilow, 'Macarena' Played On Loop To Flush Out Anti-Vaccine Mandate Protesters In NZ",coronavirus," WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Some countries might send in a riot squad to disperse trespassing protesters. In New Zealand, authorities turned on the sprinklers and Barry Manilow. Initial moves to try and flush out several hundred protesters who have been camped on Parliament’s grassy grounds since Tuesday had little effect. The protesters, who have been voicing their opposition to coronavirus vaccine mandates, responded to the soaking from the sprinklers by digging trenches and installing makeshift drainpipes to divert the water. When a downpour hit Saturday, their numbers only grew. Protesters brought in bales of straw, which they scattered on the increasingly sodden grounds at Parliament. Some shouted, others danced and one group performed an Indigenous Maori haka. By evening, Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard had come up with a new plan to make the protesters uncomfortable: using a sound system to blast out vaccine messages, decades-old Barry Manilow songs and the 1990s earworm hit “Macarena” on a repeat loop. Protesters responded by playing their own tunes, including Twister Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It.” The protest began when a convoy of trucks and cars drove to Parliament from around the nation, inspired by protests in Canada. At first there were more than 1,000 protesters but that number dwindled as the week wore on before growing again on Saturday. Police have been taking a more hands-off approach since Thursday, when they arrested 122 people and charged many of them with trespassing or obstruction. Police, who have been wearing protective vests but haven’t been using riot gear or carrying guns, had tried to slowly advance on the protesters. But that resulted in a number of physical confrontations. A video of two female officers briefly dragging a naked woman by her hair from amid a scuffle went viral. In a response to questions from The Associated Press, New Zealand police said they did not remove the woman’s clothing as some people had claimed online, and that she had been naked for “some time” before her arrest. Police also said the images and videos didn’t provide the full context of the protest activity or the situation that police faced. Still, the scuffles seemed to prompt a strategic rethink by police, who appeared more content to wait it out as the week wore on. But by Friday, Mallard, the Parliament speaker, had seen enough, and told staff to turn on the sprinklers overnight. “I ordered them on,” he confirmed to the AP. “No one who is here is here legally, and if they’re getting wet from below as well as above, they’re likely to be a little bit less comfortable and more likely to go home,” Mallard said, according to news organization Stuff. “Some people have suggested we add the vaccine in the water, but I don’t think it works that way,” he joked. Mallard told media he was responsible for the sound system loop as well. Some of the protesters’ vehicles have remained parked in the middle of streets around Parliament, forcing some street closures. The National Library and many cafes and bars in the area have closed their doors while the protest plays out. Police said one protester had a medical event on Friday evening and an ambulance was unable to reach him because of the vehicles blocking the streets, resulting in a delay before he was treated. Among the protesters’ grievances is the requirement in New Zealand that certain workers get vaccinated against COVID-19, including teachers, doctors, nurses, police and military personnel. Many protesters also oppose mask mandates — such as those in stores and among children over about age 8 in classrooms — and champion the ideal of more “freedom.” Parliament’s grounds have often been the site of peaceful protests, although mass campouts are unusual. Typically at least some politicians will come out to listen to the concerns of protesters, but politicians reconvening at Parliament after a summer break were in rare unison by not acknowledging the protesters. New Zealand was spared the worst of the pandemic after it closed its borders and implemented strict lockdowns, limiting the spread of the virus. The nation has reported just 53 virus deaths among its population of 5 million. But some have grown weary of the restrictions. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last week said the country would end its quarantine requirements for incoming travelers in stages as it reopened its borders. With about 77% of New Zealanders vaccinated, Ardern has also promised she won’t impose more lockdowns. An outbreak of the omicron variant has been growing, with New Zealand reporting a record 454 new community cases Saturday. But none of the 27 people hospitalized from the outbreak needed to be in intensive care beds."
4,5 Things COVID Experts Need To See Before They'll Go Maskless At The Office,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, Work/Life This week, the governors of nearly a dozen states, including California, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey, said they would soon lift or loosen indoor mask mandates, citing COVID-19 vaccination rates, “the extremely low risk for young people” and lowered hospitalization rates. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still recommending that people wear masks in areas of high virus transmission and in schools, regardless of vaccination status. Many businesses are still requiring employees to be masked in the office. “We have and continue to recommend masking in areas of high and substantial transmission ― that is essentially everywhere in the country in public indoor settings,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said in an interview Tuesday with Maryland radio station WYPR. “Right now we still have about 290,000 cases every single day, and our hospitalization rates now are higher than they even were at the peak of our delta surge.“ With these conflicting messages, it’s easy to get confused about what you should be doing when you go to work, especially in an indoor office setting. This is where experts who research COVID and public health measures come in. HuffPost asked COVID health experts what they are personally considering before they decide that they can take off their masks at work. Here’s what they want to see first: Each expert HuffPost interviewed said that low community transmission is a factor they’ll consider necessary before going maskless at work. None had an exact date of when that might be. Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist who works for New York City’s hospital systems, noted that health care workers like herself are under different state and federal masking directives. But for people who don’t work in health care, ”given New York City is still experiencing high levels of community transmission, I would keep masking for a little while longer until case counts come down a bit more.“ When asked if he would be comfortable going maskless indoors at work where he lives, Mark Rupp, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, replied, “Currently today in Omaha, Nebraska? No.” He pointed to the rate of infections in his community as a reason why. “We are coming off our omicron wave, but we are nowhere close to where I would like to see it be. Here in our county, we are running 45 cases per 100,000 per day…. I’d like to see that somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 [cases per 100,000].” He also pointed out that even after low community transmission is reached, employees should keep an open mind and be prepared to go back to wearing masks if another coronavirus variant causes a fresh wave of infections. “We are going to be in this ebb-and-flow situation where another variant is likely to come along. When that happens, people need to be nimble and flexible.” Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist working on coronavirus vaccines at the University of Washington, estimates that she would start to be more comfortable going maskless at work in April or May, citing daily death and infection projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that are expected to be much lower by April. But right now, transmission rates are high. “If you walk in a room where somebody had omicron and you don’t have a mask on, you are guaranteed to pick that thing up,” Fuller said. “In the coming months, the case rates will go significantly down, and it will be time to throw our masks away,” said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University. “But now is not a good time to get COVID-19. The reason is because cases are still high and our hospitals are at full capacity, so we may not get the best health care.” In a February article for JAMA Health Forum, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Medical Association, Gostin wrote that it may be too soon to shift to an endemic phase of the pandemic while omicron-related hospitalizations remain high and effective therapeutics are scarce. “There is an extreme national shortage of effective treatments that can keep us from getting serious disease, hospitalization and even death,” he told HuffPost, citing the lack of access to monoclonal antibodies and oral antiviral pills. “We should continue to take care to avoid getting infected until conditions are more favorable. That is likely to happen in the next couple of months, but it is too soon to throw caution to the wind.” Madad said to consider what local epidemiological data is saying about the rate of COVID transmission and vaccination. “If vaccination rates are low, cases are high, hospitals in your area are still stretched, you should continue masking indoors,” she said. For non-health-care workers in New York City, for example, she recommended mask-wearing indoors until COVID case counts go down more. “My exception is if I’m around colleagues who are fully vaccinated, then I’d be comfortable with going maskless,” Madad said. Rupp said that people need to look at the vaccination numbers in their specific workplaces, too, noting that offices with “somewhere in the neighborhood of a 90% vaccination rate are highly protected.” “With some of the variants that we are seeing, vaccination hasn’t been as protective against transmission as we would like,” Rupp said, pointing out this is true of omicron. Even if all of the workers in a given office are vaccinated, Fuller still advised masking for now because of the high transmission rates. She noted there are vulnerable groups, such as children who cannot be vaccinated yet and elderly people who don’t have a strong immune response to the vaccine, that might be connected to the work bubble. “You can have a workplace with a 100% vaccination rate and the risk of them transmitting at work is low,” she said, but “this virus does infect vaccinated people, and vaccinated people, even if they’re asymptomatic, could potentially spread that to the old immunocompromised guy at the marketplace.” Additionally, masking indoors will help the pandemic become endemic sooner, Fuller said. “If we keep up the diligence, we are probably just a few months away from seeing this become endemic,” she said. “The point is we’re winning right now…. Don’t slow down yet; the finish line is right there.” Certain people are at high risk of severe COVID illness and should keep wearing masks in the office even when their colleagues are vaccinated and transmission rates are lower, experts said. Gostin said to ask yourself “What is my level of vulnerability, such as age, preexisting conditions and vaccination status?” before taking off a mask. Though risk tolerance is personal, Madad said that health status is one of the main factors that should decide whether you mask up at work. “If you’re up to date with your vaccinations and have no significant underlying health conditions that may put you in the high-risk category (i.e., immunocompromised), then your relative risk is low,” she said. Along with factors such as community transmission and work vaccination rates, Rupp said that the quality of the ventilation and filtration system in an office building would be important to know before going maskless. Rupp said that about 8 to 10 air changes per hour is a good rate for indoor building ventilation. And if a building has upgraded its filtration system to MERV 15 standards or higher, “this is going to supply a very clean air to the occupants of that space,” he said. Gostin said he would also consider how many people are in the building before taking off a mask. “I would be distinctly uncomfortable being unmasked if I was surrounded by a lot of people, especially if I did not know their vaccination status,” he said.

5,How Much Does One-Way Masking Protect You From COVID?,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost More and more places are dropping their COVID mask mandates. Recently, several airlines announced that they will no longer require masks to fly after a federal judge voided an extended mandate. Some transit companies, like Uber and Amtrak, followed suit. The changes are divisive, inspiring both celebration and concern among scientists, public health officials and people simply trying to go about their lives two years into the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its stance on public masking, and “continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time,” the agency states on its site. All of which raises questions about how to proceed. Should you still mask up when in public, even if you live an an area that no longer requires it? Does it do any good? Here are some important points to keep in mind: There isn’t a large, controlled study that directly compares the efficacy of universal masking to one-way masking for preventing the spread of COVID, largely because there are so many variables at play. What’s the setting? What is local transmission like? What types of masks are people wearing, and how well do they fit? Still, doctors and researchers are pretty much unanimous that universal masking is the gold standard. “There is no question that it is more effective for both the individual and for public health for a high fraction of people to wear good masks when they are in shared air spaces indoors,” said Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist at the University of Denver. “Masks act as excellent source control, meaning that they keep the infectious aerosol from going into the room, and they can dramatically reduce the infectious dose that the susceptible person breathes in.” “Masks act as excellent source control, meaning that they keep the infectious aerosol from going into the room, and they can dramatically reduce the infectious dose that the susceptible person breathes in.” The benefits that masks confer multiply when everyone who is in a room — meaning both the infectious person and the person who could become infected — wears a mask, Huffman explained. So the infected person is less likely to spread the virus. The susceptible person is less likely to get infected. And they’re therefore less likely to pass it among themselves and to anyone else they interact with. A widely covered CDC report from last summer demonstrates the potential limits of one-way masking in indoor group settings. A teacher in Marin County, California, who was occasionally unmasked over the course of two days at work, spread the virus to half of their students — all of whom were masked. Some of those children spread it to family members. Things have changed since then, so what happens in classrooms may not play out in the same way. For one, that outbreak occurred during the delta surge. But omicron is up to four times more transmissible. On the other hand, it also took place before children ages 5 to 11 were eligible for vaccines. Today they are, though overall vaccination within that age group remains low. There’s a reason why health care workers have long worn masks in many clinical settings, whether or not their patients were also masked up: The masks protect the person wearing them. So if you’re in an area of high transmission or you’re simply not comfortable going unmasked indoors, you should take comfort knowing that your mask provides you with an additional layer of protection. “It is worth doing,” said Dr. Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious diseases and pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine. “We have a very simple, safe and effective intervention.” Martinello pointed to a CDC study that found people who wore a high-grade medical mask in indoor settings had an 83% lower risk of getting COVID than those who did not mask indoors. He noted that it’s impossible to say whether everyone else around them was also masked but said it offers yet more evidence that masking prevents spread of the virus. If you plan to keep masking up indoors, the type and fit is critical, perhaps now more than ever. Your first choice should be a high-quality medical mask, like an N95, KN95 or KF94. A well-fitted N95 can filter out up to 95% of particles in the air. That recent CDC study on effectiveness of use in indoor settings found that cloth masks and surgical masks are much less effective at preventing COVID spread than these medical-grade masks. “At this point in the pandemic, especially if you are the only one wearing a mask, I would not bother with anything less than a very high-quality respirator.” “The quality of the mask filter and the quality of the fit to your face both matter a lot, especially if you’re relying on your mask to do all the heavy lifting to keep you safe from virus in the air you share with others,” Huffman said. “At this point in the pandemic, especially if you are the only one wearing a mask, I would not bother with anything less than a very high-quality respirator.” Ideally, that would be an N95 or, if you’re in a setting that warrants it, the more substantial elastomeric half mask respirators, he said. But “KF-94-rated masks are very high quality, and KN95 masks can be very good if they are not counterfeit,” he added. (Be careful: The CDC warns that counterfeits abound. Here’s where to buy ones that aren’t.) Fit matters, too. “It should seal across the bridge of your nose and be held down by a little metal strip, pull firmly against your cheeks, and seal under your chin and jaw line,” Huffman said. If possible, consider masks with head straps rather than ear loops for a better seal, he recommended. Of course, many people — including some health experts — are enthusiastically welcoming the decision to drop mask mandates. They point out that we have layers of protection available to us: We have vaccines and boosters, which lower your risk of becoming infected and, crucially, of becoming severely ill if you do. Public health experts have also learned a lot about the importance of ventilation in indoor settings. For example, many schools have improved HVAC filters, added portable HEPA filtration and are keeping the windows open, Huffman said. Opening windows in other settings ― like in a ride share, for example ― will also help. Hand-washing, though not the most exciting of interventions, continues to be important as well. Those layers mean that masks aren’t the only thing preventing the spread of COVID. They all matter when it comes to stopping transmission. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

6,Aaron Rodgers Wins MVP Award,coronavirus," LOS ANGELES (AP) — A four-time MVP, three Super Bowl players and the beginning of a brother act. The Associated Press 2021 NFL awards had a bit of everything, starting with Aaron Rodgers becoming the fifth player to repeat as Most Valuable Player. “It is kind of surreal sitting here,” Rodgers said. “Being a four-time MVP is crazy. “They’re all different. They’ve all been unique in their own ways and this one feels the sweetest.” Despite the turmoil of training camp and the headlines created by the Green Bay quarterback when he misled the public on his COVID-19 vaccination, Rodgers’ play on the field was superb. So much so that he earned 39 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the NFL. Not even one of Tom Brady’s best performances — in his final season — came close in the MVP race, with the Buccaneers quarterback getting 10 votes. Only Peyton Manning with five MVP awards is ahead of Rodgers, who said no announcement on his future in the NFL is imminent. “There was something to how I felt walking off the field,” he said. “I had great conversations with the Packers before I left town. There have been changes to the staff. Just comes down to weighing where I am at mentally and what the commitment is. ”I don’t fear retirement and moving on. I’m very proud of what I have accomplished over being in Green Bay for 17 years. Also still highly competitive and bitter taste from the NFC game. I was frustrated about things during the offseason and I feel like there’s so much growth. There were some things voiced privately, and I am thankful for the response. There were things done to make me feel special and important.” Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp got one vote for MVP, but he easily took top offensive player honors. Kupp and Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow (Comeback Player) and wideout Ja’Marr Chase (Offensive Rookie) will face off in Sunday’s Super Bowl. Kupp led the NFL with 138 receptions, 1,829 yards receiving and 15 touchdown catches while leading Los Angeles to the NFC West title. A unanimous All-Pro, he received 35 votes, far in front of Colts running back Jonathan Taylor (10). Kupp was so productive while working with a new passer, Matthew Stafford, that he had 14 games with at least 10 catches, no games with fewer than seven. Though he isn’t the fastest nor strongest wideout, he had 100 yards receiving in 11 contests. Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt, a unanimous All-Pro like Kupp, led the NFL in sacks with a record-tying 22 1/2. He joined brother J.J., a three-time winner of Defensive Player of the Year. “I’m not huge on individual awards,” said Pittsburgh’s Watt, “but it’s tough not to want that when I saw my brother at the height of his career win that award three times. And I always just thought to myself why can’t I do that?” You have, T.J. “Some moments are just special. Couldn’t be more proud of you,”  older brother J.J. tweeted after he’d announced the winner on stage. Dallas linebacker Micah Parsons, who came in second to Watt for top defensive player — but 37 votes behind — was a unanimous choice for Defensive Rookie of the Year. Parsons not only helped the Cowboys turn around their defensive performance this season, but he was so dynamic he helped coordinator Dan Quinn win the assistant coach award. Parsons promised he would get next what Watt has now. “It’s an honor, and I’m still hungry, you now what I mean?” he said. “I’m coming for him next year. ... But I guess it’ll be something for me to have ... for next year.” In the Bengals’ worst-to-first AFC North rise, and then deep into the playoffs, Chase was a major contributor. The fifth overall pick in last April’s draft despite skipping the 2020 season at LSU due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chase had 81 receptions for 1,455 yards with 13 touchdowns. His quarterback, of course, was Burrow, two years after they helped LSU win the national championship. Burrow’s rookie season was cut short by a knee injury in his 10th game with a 2-7-1 record. The Bengals quarterback sure made up for that in 2021. He smashed single-season franchise records for passer rating (108.3), yards (4,611), TDs passing and 300-yard games (six). His precision passing ranked first in the league at a 70.4% completion percentage, and despite being sacked a league-high 51 times, Burrow had an 8.9 yards per attempt that also led the NFL. Mike Vrabel’s work with the Titans earned him Coach of the Year. Despite using a record for a non-strike season 91 players, and losing his very best, running back Derrick Henry, for half the schedule, Vrabel led Tennessee to the AFC South crown and the conference’s top seed. “It is a reflection of our football team and staff,” Vrabel explained. “They make a connection with our players. Players will come and go, I played for 14 years. You can still make a connection and care for your guys. “I’m excited about it because we have had adversity and been able to persevere through that.” Rams veteran tackle Andrew Whitworth, who also played for the Bengals, won the league’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award."

8,"European Royals Hit By COVID: Prince Charles, King Of Spain, Queen Of Denmark Test Positive",coronavirus," LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Prince Charles has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating, his office said Thursday. A message on the royal’s official Twitter page said Charles tested positive on Thursday morning and was “deeply disappointed” not to be able to attend a scheduled visit in Winchester, England. No other details were immediately available. Charles, 73, met dozens of people during a Wednesday evening reception at the British Museum. The heir to the throne previously contracted the coronavirus in March 2020. Officials said he had mild COVID-19 symptoms then. Charles and his wife, Camilla, isolated at Queen Elizabeth II’s Balmoral estate in Scotland at the time. Spain’s King Felipe VI, 54, and Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II, 81, also tested positive for the coronavirus this week. This morning The Prince of Wales has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now self-isolating.HRH is deeply disappointed not to be able to attend today's events in Winchester and will look to reschedule his visit as soon as possible."
9,"King Of Spain, Queen Of Denmark Test Positive For COVID",coronavirus," COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The queen of Denmark and the king of Spain both tested positive for the coronavirus despite being vaccinated, their respective royal houses announced Wednesday. Denmark’s Queen Margrethe, 82, has mild COVID-19 symptoms and has isolated herself in the Copenhagen palace where she lives, the palace said. Margrethe tested positive for the virus on Tuesday evening and canceled a planned vacation in Norway that was set to begin Wednesday, the royal household said. The announcement came weeks after Margrethe marked her 50 years on the throne of Europe’s oldest ruling monarchy. Some of the planned festivities were postponed until September due to the pandemic. However, the queen participated in some jubilee events this month, including a wreath-laying at the grave of her parents at Roskilde Cathedral, where Danish royals have been buried since 1559. She also met with the government and attended a reception at Parliament. Like Margrethe, Spain’s King Felipe VI was vaccinated against the coronavirus. The 54-year-old monarch was tested for the virus after he developed “mild symptoms” of COVID-19, the royal house said. It added that his “overall health” was fine and he will remain in isolation for seven days, following national health protocols. The royal house said that Queen Letizia has not shown any symptoms. With 90% of its population over age 12 years old having received at least two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, Spain is starting to roll back health restrictions as the latest surge driven by the omicron variant ebbs."

0,Rep. Thomas Massie Mocked For Truly Dumb Tweet About 'Medicare For All',coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has engineering degrees from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but that didn’t stop him from being schooled by Twitter users on Wednesday. It happened after the conservative Kentucky congressman attempted to criticize “Medicare for All” by using a really, really dubious analogy. “Over 70% of Americans who died with COVID, died on Medicare, and some people want #MedicareForAll?” he asked rhetorically. Over 70% of Americans who died with COVID, died on Medicare, and some people want #MedicareForAll ? Although even most first-year philosophy students might see problems with the post, Massie didn’t, leaving the denizens of Twitter to point out the flaws.

1,9 Face Masks With Powerful Ingredients To Fight Maskne,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost The current situation requires us to wear face masks to help stop the spread of COVID-19, which has increased the number of us developing maskne, acne that’s brought on by our face masks. “Humidity and moisture gets trapped on the skin under the mask, allowing bacteria to breed on the skin. This can result in inflammation and breakouts,” Faye Purcell, a product development chemist at Q+A, told HuffPost. But thankfully it’s winter, otherwise known as the time of year we all love to use those other face masks ... the skin care kind. There’s nothing like a good face mask in your skin care routine to help treat skin concerns. When it comes to face mask formulas, Purcell suggests looking for products that contain ingredients such as zinc, zinc PCA, niacinamide, clay (like bentonite and kaolin), charcoal and AHAs such as malic, glycolic, salicylic and lactic acid. Zinc is a great starting point, according to Purcell, as it is a skin-balancing active ingredient that helps to prevent an overproduction of sebum, which can clog pores and cause breakouts. Niacinamide, which has become increasingly popular over the past 18 months, is a good active ingredient for pore cleansing and blemish prevention. “Unlike many blemish-busting ingredients, niacinamide is well tolerated by many skin types and it’s the perfect active to use in combination with other active ingredients,” Purcell said. “It pairs up well with most acids, vitamin C and even retinol, so it can be easily added into your current regimen.” Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) improve skin texture and minimize the appearance of pores thanks to their exfoliating properties. AHAs are a must-have in your skin care routine, Purcell said, adding, “They encourage desquamation (the shedding) of the outermost layer of skin, revealing a bright and smooth complexion. They complement all skin types, even those with dry and sensitive skin.” When it comes to clay-based masks, Purcell recommends kaolin clay as it draws out impurities, shrinks pores and decreases sebum. It’s a natural clay that is very useful in face masks as it helps to detoxify and purify. Bentonite is another natural clay that has the power to absorb excess oil (known as sebum) and is the perfect ingredient for oily, acne and blemish-prone skin types. Activated charcoal is an ingredient that pairs well with natural clays. “Activated charcoal is created through a heating process which gives it its brilliant detoxifying power. Acting a bit like a magnet, the charcoal sucks out all that dirt and toxins from the skin leaving the complexion soft, purified, and clear,” Purcell said. Vitamin C is also another star ingredient that people should add to their skin care regimen. “Incorporating some antioxidant vitamin C skin care products into your routine will help keep skin healthy and protect it from any harmful pollutants as well as any bacteria from under the mask. Vitamin C in particular does this very well and can neutralize any free radicals, repair any damaged cells from mask-wearing but also help brighten the appearance of skin,” Purcell said. We’ve rounded up face masks packed with the ingredients Purcell has recommended. Maskne be gone! HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

2,Stacey Abrams Apologizes For Not Wearing Mask In Photos With Schoolchildren,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D) apologized on Tuesday for appearing maskless while posing for photos with masked schoolchildren last week. After receiving fierce backlash from political rivals, Abrams told CNN’s Erin Burnett that she had removed the mask for a photo at Glennwood Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia on Friday after wearing one up to the podium. Video of the appearance supported that claim, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “I followed the protocols. I told the kids I’m taking my mask off because I’m reading to kids who are listening remotely as well, and we were socially distanced — the kids were socially distanced from me,” Abrams said. “In the excitement after I finished, because it was so much fun working with those kids, I took a picture, and that was a mistake. Protocols matter, and protecting our kids is the most important thing, and anything that can be perceived as undermining that is a mistake, and I apologize,” she added. The images were circulated after the school’s principal tweeted her thanks along with snaps of a maskless Abrams posing with students for the reading event to honor Black History Month. Abrams then retweeted them. Within hours, Republicans ― including gubernatorial rivals Gov. Brian Kemp and former Sen. David Perdue ― attacked both the principal and Abrams, prompting them to delete their tweets, the AJC reported. Kemp described Abrams’ action as “hypocrisy,” while Perdue declared: “Liberals’ thirst for power during this pandemic has caused enormous damage to our kids, while the elite like Stacey continue living their lives.” Abrams’ campaign said Sunday that she encourages schools to require masks for students and staff, and that she supports public health requirements that recommend masks in other close or indoor settings, per the AJC. The campaign called the GOP attacks “pathetic, transparent and silly.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,"Canada, Finland Mask Up To Play Russian Team Decimated By COVID",coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Finland’s players wore masks in their women’s hockey game Tuesday night, becoming the second consecutive team to do so while facing the Russians. The game Monday between the Russians and Canadians was delayed because of virus concerns. The Russian COVID-19 testing results from earlier in the day were not yet available by game time, and Russian players were testing positive before and after the team’s loss to the United States on Saturday. The Canadians and Russians agreed to start the game in masks. The Russians took off theirs for the start of the third period, while the Canadians finished their 6-1 win with masks on. Later, coach Evgeny Bobariko told state news agency RIA Novosti that Polina Bolgareva — who played against Canada — tested positive. Finland beat Russia 5-0."
4,GOP Congressman Downplays Deaths Of Children From COVID,coronavirus," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Penn.) on Tuesday tried to downplay the number of children who have died from COVID-19, saying that many had preexisting medical conditions that contributed to their deaths — glossing over the fact that, had they not become infected with COVID, they would not have died from it. “Many of these children had preexisting — I’m sorry, had underlying medical conditions, making them more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 than the average child,” Reschenthaler said on the House floor, during a debate about masks in schools. “Meaning that many of these children died with COVID, not of COVID.” “But again, that’s real science, not political science,” he added. Here’s a clip of Reschenthaler making his remarks: Rep. Reschenthaler tries to downplay the deaths of children from COVID saying many of them died with COVID not from COVID pic.twitter.com/wSyyzqmv2v It’s true that most children who have died from COVID-19 had an underlying medical condition. There are also significant racial disparities in COVID deaths among children; Black, Hispanic and Native American children make up the majority of deaths. But these children died as a result of becoming infected by COVID-19. As one observer noted on Twitter, it’s like saying people who were devoured by sharks died due to a loss of blood, not because a shark ripped them apart. The most common underlying conditions in children who have died from COVID-19 aren’t obscure medical conditions, either. They are asthma, obesity and cardiac issues. As of Feb. 2, 910 children age 0-18 years old have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Reschenthaler spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Ron DeSantis: Joe Rogan 'Shouldn't Have Apologized' For Slurs,coronavirus," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said podcast star Joe Rogan “shouldn’t have apologized” for repeatedly using a racist slur, comparing a Black neighborhood to “Planet of the Apes” and spreading coronavirus misinformation on his show “The Joe Rogan Experience.” DeSantis, weighing in on the controversy in an interview with Fox News on Monday, pointed a finger at “the left,” claiming those with opposing political opinions want to bring Rogan down because of his ability to “reach so many people.” “I think the left fear the fact that he can reach so many people, and so they’re out to destroy him,” said DeSantis, who has risen to GOP prominence with his rejection of pandemic public safety measures. “But what I would say is don’t give an inch. Do not apologize. Do not kowtow to the mob. Stand up and tell them to pound sand. If you do that, there’s really nothing that they’re able to do to you. The only way they have power is if you let them get your goat.” DeSantis’ defense of Rogan came the same day that former President Donald Trump offered the podcaster similar advice amid a growing outcry against streaming platform Spotify. Music icons Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, among other artists, pulled their music catalogs off Spotify rather than continue to share the platform with Rogan. “Joe, just go about what you do so well and don’t let them make you look weak and frightened,” Trump said in a statement. DeSantis said he doesn’t listen to Rogan’s show, but believes the podcast’s promotion of anti-vaccine guests is “just bringing opposing views. He’s letting people decide.” Science and medical experts have argued that Rogan’s podcast promotes false information with one-sided takes that jeopardize public health and damage public trust in science and medical professionals. Rogan issued an apology on Instagram Saturday for his racist language, calling it “regretful” and “shameful,” but claimed he never used the N-word in a racist way. “I never used it to be racist because I’m not racist, but whenever you’re in a situation where you have to say, ‘I’m not racist,’ you fucked up and I clearly have fucked up,” he said. He also addressed his comparison of a Black neighborhood with the movie “Planet of the Apes” when he said he went to see the film and there were no other white people in the audience. “We walked into ‘Planet of the Apes.’ We walked into Africa, dude. We walked in the door and there were no white people. There was no white people. ‘Planet of the Apes’ didn’t take place in Africa. That was a racist thing for me to say,” Rogan said on his program in 2013. Rogan denied he meant to compare Black people with apes. “I did not nor would I ever say that Black people are apes, but it sure fucking sounded like that,” he said Saturday. “I immediately afterwards said that’s a racist thing to say, ‘Planet of the Apes’ wasn’t even in Africa, I was just saying there was a lot of Black people there.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,U.S. Figure Skater Vincent Zhou Addresses COVID Diagnosis In Tearful Video,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost U.S. figure skater Vincent Zhou, in a tearful video message on Instagram, talked about the “crushing” loneliness of having to isolate ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics, only to test positive for COVID-19 and be forced to withdraw prematurely from the Beijing Games. Zhou, 21, described his diagnosis as “pretty unreal” because “I’ve been doing everything in my power to stay free of COVID since the start of the pandemic.” “I’ve taken all the precautions I can,” he said. “I’ve isolated myself so much that the loneliness I’ve felt in the last month or two has been crushing at times. The enormity of the situation, the … just … the pain of it all.” A post shared by Vincent Zhou (@govincentzhou) Zhou won silver as part of the men’s team event on Sunday. He had been scheduled to compete in the men’s short program Tuesday. Closing the five-minute message, the Olympian said he’d “close this out before I become even more of an emotional wreck.” “I’ve already lost count of the number of times I’ve cried today,” he said. “But I’m happy to say that at least one of those times was happy tears and that was when I found out that I became an Olympic silver medalist.” Reporter, HuffPost"
7,New Jersey Lifting School Mask Mandate In March,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost New Jersey will lift its statewide school mask mandate next month, Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday. “Balancing public health with getting back to some semblance of normalcy is not easy,” the Democrat tweeted. “But we can responsibly take this step due to declining COVID numbers and growth in vaccinations.” The mandate, which has required all students and school employees to wear masks on campus, is scheduled to lift March 7. Effective March 7, the statewide mask mandate in schools will be lifted.Balancing public health with getting back to some semblance of normalcy is not easy. But we can responsibly take this step due to declining COVID numbers and growth in vaccinations. https://t.co/CjnIYZycCe The numbers of new COVID-19 cases in New Jersey have dropped more than 70% in the past two weeks. It’s one of the most vaccinated states, with nearly three-quarters of all people in the state considered “fully vaccinated” and about one-third having received a booster dose. Delaware’s Gov. John Carney (D) also announced Monday that his state’s school mask mandate will expire March 31 and that schools and school districts will be able to consider their own masking rules going forward. He urged parents to vaccinate their eligible children in the pursuit of returning to normalcy at schools. “For all the parents out there — the best way to keep your child in school learning, and to prevent them from getting sick, is to get them vaccinated,” he said in a statement. “It’s that simple. I want to thank all Delawareans for taking this threat seriously.” Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) followed suit later Monday, saying the decision “was not made lightly” and involved lengthy discussions with the state’s education and public health departments. People should expect governors in other states to make similar announcements soon, he added. “I also consulted with other governors in our region who have or will be making similar moves soon,” Lamont tweeted. Mask mandates, particularly those in schools, have firmly divided Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Blue state leaders have cited widespread masking as an effective tool at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and followed a more cautious route amid the threat of new variants. Some GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, have gone so far as to ban local governments and school districts from enacting mask ordinances. With COVID-19 cases plummeting after reaching staggering new levels in mid-January, Murphy and other Democrats are now signaling some optimism about the state of the pandemic. Last month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) ended his statewide school mask mandate and said schools could set their own rules. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said last week she is similarly reevaluating the state’s school masking rules. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Read This Before You Get Excited About Weed Preventing COVID,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost You may have read recently that weed might be a natural antidote to the coronavirus. The buzz took off last month, when researchers at the University of Chicago published findings from a laboratory experiment on rodents that suggested CBD — a compound in cannabis — may block the coronavirus from replicating in cells. And so came the headlines claiming that weed could prevent or treat COVID. But scientists who study the ways cannabis interacts with pathogens, our cells and the immune system say understanding the impact cannabis has on SARS-CoV-2 is not so simple. COVID-19 is a complex disease, and cannabis is a complex plant. Different compounds in the plant — like THC and CBD — have vastly different effects that, for the most part, aren’t well understood. And even though certain compounds derived from cannabis have shown success against SARS-CoV-2 in lab experiments, those findings don’t necessarily translate to humans in the real world. Robust clinical trials haven’t yet been done to clearly understand the dosing and the mechanisms of action in the human body. It’s promising, and the growing body of research suggests certain compounds in cannabis have antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects that could be helpful tools in the arsenal against COVID, according to Susan Trapp, a research scientist at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Arizona. “But this is by no means a prevention at this point,” Trapp told HuffPost. It’s important to first recognize that CBD — a compound in the cannabis plant — and THC — a psychoactive ingredient in cannabis — are very different chemicals that happen to come from the same plant. When exploring whether cannabis has any impact on COVID, it’s crucial to discern whether we’re talking about CBD or THC. “THC and CBD have very, very broadly different effects,” Daniele Piomelli, the director of the University of California Irvine Center of Cannabis, said. If you lump THC and CBD together, people might get the wrong idea that smoking pot or taking edibles might protect them from COVID. A number of lab studies have now shown that CBD could have antiviral properties. We also know that COVID can trigger an intense inflammatory response in the body. Also clear: CBD has some strong anti-inflammatory effects. The data suggests that CBD is both antiviral and anti-inflammatory — an uncommon combination. But before people start taking CBD for COVID, we need a lot more data to understand how lab findings translate to humans, Trapp said. THC is a very different story. THC actually has immunosuppressant effects, and previous research has shown it can reduce the ability of the immune system to attack bacterial and viral pathogens, according to Piomelli. What we don’t know, however, is whether THC would also be an immunosuppressant with COVID-19. Plus, THC, when smoked, can damage the cells in the respiratory tract, which isn’t a great thing when you’re dealing with a virus that infects these airways. THC does have some anti-inflammatory effects with certain health conditions, but not as much as CBD. “THC is a much better analgesic [pain reliever] than it is an anti-inflammatory compound,” Piomelli said. Additionally, because THC and CBD can bind to the same receptors, it’s possible that THC could inhibit CBD’s antiviral effects, according to Trapp. It’s worth noting that, in general, research on THC and its health effects is slim. THC is classified by the U.S. government as a Schedule 1 drug, which makes it extremely hard for researchers to secure funding. Even though CBD may have some antiviral properties, scientists who study the effects of cannabis do not recommend using weed — in any form — in an effort to prevent or treat COVID. Piomelli’s message to those who are eager to explore how weed interacts with the coronavirus: “Be careful.” The science is in the very early stages, and there are still many unknowns about cannabis use and COVID. Additionally, cannabis is poorly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and using CBD is not so easy. “The doses — the amounts one would have to ingest of CBD — to have any of the effects we’re talking about are really large,” Piomelli said. Ingesting a few milligrams of CBD would have little to no effect — it would take hundreds of milligrams a day to see any of the effects that studies have reported. For one, it’d be expensive — and difficult — to get your hands on that much CBD. And though CBD is a fairly safe compound, ingesting that much on a daily basis could lead to health complications. It could potentially damage the liver, which would be hard at work trying to break down and clear the toxins from your system. Piomelli said that ingesting high amounts of CBD also could inhibit the effectiveness of other medications (like blood thinners or blood pressure drugs). All these medications and drugs would make the liver work harder — and you could develop problems with the liver or have problems with the other medications. “You’re adults, do whatever you think is good for you, but at least be careful — monitor yourself, and be smart about it,” Piomelli said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

9,Coronavirus Cases Spike Across Asia Following Lunar New Year,coronavirus," SINGAPORE (AP) — Many Asian countries are facing a spike in COVID-19 infections after the widely-celebrated Lunar New Year holidays, as health officials grapple with the highly-transmissible omicron variant and expectations that numbers will continue to rise in coming weeks. The Lunar New Year, which is China’s biggest holiday, was celebrated across Asia on Feb. 1 even as pandemic restrictions in many countries kept crowds and family outings to a minimum. Hong Kong’s authorities are confronting record cases that are straining its so-called “zero-COVID” policy. On Monday, the city reported a new high of 614 local infections. “We expect there will be more cases coming in a few days. We consider this as some effects after the holiday events and clusters,” told reporters on Monday Edwin Tsui, an official with the Centre for Health Protection. “With our current containment measures, we hope we can still contain the disease.” Hong Kong currently requires all cases to be hospitalized. On Monday, authorities announced that close contacts of infected persons will be allowed to isolate at home, starting from Tuesday. Those who test positive while in home isolation will be transferred to a hospital. Hong Kong has aligned itself with China’s “zero-COVID” policy that aims to totally stamp out outbreaks, even as many other countries change their approach to living with the virus. Authorities look to impose lockdowns on residential buildings wherever clusters of infections are identified, and have banned public dining after 6 p.m. In Singapore, a dramatic rise in coronavirus infections followed last week’s holiday, with cases tripling to 13,000 on Friday. Daily infections have since dipped to 7,752 on Sunday, amid restrictions that include limited capacity for restaurants and capping the number of unique visitors to each household. Singapore has reported over 100,000 cases spanning the last month, although over 99% of the cases are mild or asymptomatic. Across Asia, authorities are confronting a similar pattern as the more easily transmissible omicron becomes dominant, even as health officials in several countries report that omicron surges are not driving hospitalizations or deaths as high as the previous delta variant. In Japan, nearly 90,000 new cases nationwide were reported on Sunday, including 17,526 in Tokyo, as local omicron infections showed no signs of slowing. Experts say the infections are now spreading to vulnerable elderly people who are beginning to fill more hospital beds. Less than 5% of the country’s population has received their third dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Local outbreak numbers are similarly rising in Indonesia, edging toward the caseloads that marked the height of last year’s devastating delta outbreak. On Jan. 6, Indonesia recorded 533 new COVID-19 cases and seven deaths. A month later on Sunday, the daily figure had soared to 36,057. Daily deaths have also climbed to 57, almost four times the rate a week ago. In Thailand, officials on Monday reported more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row, but the Department of Disease Control said that the number of severely ill patients was dropping, while the fatality rate has remained stable. Department chief Opas Karnkawinpong said that Thailand might consider relaxing some of the country’s pandemic restrictions, as the omicron variant seemed to be less severe. “The global situation of COVID-19 seems to be moving in the same direction,” he was quoted as saying in The Bangkok Post. “Many countries have started to ease measured despite spikes in daily infections.” In other countries where the Lunar New Year is a major holiday, governments are likewise on high alert ahead of expectations that omicron will continue to stoke higher infections. New cases in Malaysia have been hovering higher, with the health ministry reporting 11,034 on Monday. The rise came after the Lunar New Year when many Malaysians travel, but health officials said most of the cases were asymptomatic or have light symptoms. Top health official Noor Hisham Abdullah has warned that daily cases could double by the end of March and urged Malaysians to take their booster dose. Some 98% of adults in the country have completed their vaccination and half of them have received their third jab. In South Korea, health experts warn that the country may see daily jumps of 130,000 or 170,000 by late February. The country reported 38,691 new cases of the virus, a nine-fold increase from the levels seen in mid-January, when omicron became the country’s dominant strain. In Vietnam, authorities have warned that infections may rise after the popular new year holiday. Vietnam reported 192 cases of the omicron variant in the past month, with most of those showing only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. With low hospitalization and death rates, Vietnam had previously moved toward resuming most social activities. The Philippines has moved to ease coronavirus restrictions and open its doors to tourists as outbreak numbers eased to about 8,300 on Sunday, down from a peak of 39,000 in mid-January. But social distancing restrictions remain in place amid fears of an outbreak ahead of the country’s presidential and general elections May 9. Campaigning begins on Tuesday, with a ban in place on handshakes, kissing, hugging and large crowds. In mainland China, new local infections continue to fluctuate, falling as low as nine on Friday, but rising again to 45 on Monday, most of them in the southern region of Guangxi. Recent cases have included a handful of omicron infections, though such outbreaks have been tightly contained. Chinese authorities have imposed strict local lock downs and mass testing, as the country kicked off the Beijing Winter Olympics last week. Meanwhile, the far-flung Pacific archipelago nation of Tonga has been trying to contain its first outbreak since the start of the global pandemic, which might have been brought in with the delivery of emergency medical supplies and water after last month’s volcanic eruption and tsunami. Two Tongan men who worked handling shipments tested positive last week. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni said two more positive cases were confirmed, bringing the total of active cases to seven. ___ Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, Jim Gomez in Manila, Hau Dinh in Hanoi, David Rising in Bangkok, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta contributed to this report."

0,Gov. DeSantis Going After GoFundMe For Dumping Anti-Vaccine Ottawa Truckers,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has decided to use state resources to investigate GoFundMe for dumping a group of controversial anti-vaccine truckers protesting in Canada who have been accused by Ottawa police of “unlawful” activity. The “Freedom Convoy” of truckers has been protesting for a week in downtown Ottawa over the requirement that the drivers must be vaccinated before they can drive across the border into the U.S. The truckers’ convoy was hit Friday with a $9.8 million class-action complaint for relentlessly blasting their air horns while jamming downtown Ottawa streets. They have also been accused of harassing area residents and shoppers, even assaulting some, and ripping masks off residents’ faces. Is this a peaceful protest? What if you lived here, and this was going on from early in the morning until late at night, how would you feel? #Ottawa pic.twitter.com/oIhVKCYjur DeSantis on Saturday announced on Twitter he was launching an investigation and accused GoFundMe of “fraud” for “commandeering” the $9 million raised for the truckers. He insisted the money should be refunded. Though GoFundMe initially said it would refund the money or redirect it to charities, it announced hours before DeSantis’ tweet that it would be refunding all donations to the group. To simplify the process for our users, we will be refunding all donations to the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser. This refund will happen automatically—you do not need to submit a request. Donors can expect to see refunds within 7-10 business days. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also complained on Twitter, and Elon Musk gushed: “Canadian truckers rule.” In addition, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, both Republicans, indicated Saturday that they’re investigating the issue. Donald Trump Jr. called via a tweet on Friday for all Republican attorneys general to investigate the matter. Outraged Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is under indictment for alleged securities fraud, boasted that “patriotic” truckers from his state helped fund the Canadian drivers and that he’s launching a probe. Patriotic Texans donated to Canadian truckers’ worthy cause using GoFundMe. This BLM-backing company went woke, froze the funds, &  failed to deliver Texans’ money. Today I assembled a team to investigate their potential fraud & deception. Texas donors will get Justice! #GoFundMe Yes please investigate. As a Canadian I would like to know what dark money was used to try to overthrow the govt of Canada.. may be how you folks do things south of us but here we have real lawful elections.. Ottawa’s police chief has called the truckers’ protest a “siege,” and Ottawa’s premier complained that the protest morphed into an “unacceptable occupation.” GoFundMe on Friday shut down the online fundraising campaign for the truckers, and blocked money raised for the protest because of “unlawful” activities, it said in a statement. It also said the group violated GoFundMe’s terms of service. “We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity,” the statement noted. Ottawa police thanked GoFundMe for the action. We want to thank @gofundme for listening to our concerns as a City and a police service. The decision to withhold funding for these unlawful demonstrations is an important step and we call on all crowdfunding sites to follow.

1,‘I Cry Every Day’: Winter Olympic Athletes Slam Conditions In COVID Quarantine Hotels,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Not enough food. Inedible meals. No training equipment. Some Olympic athletes unlucky enough to test positive for the coronavirus at the Beijing Olympics feel their quarantine conditions are making a bad situation much worse. “My stomach hurts, I’m very pale and I have huge black circles around my eyes. I want all this to end. I cry every day. I’m very tired,” Russian biathlon competitor Valeria Vasnetsova posted on Instagram from one of Beijing’s so-called quarantine hotels. Her problem wasn’t with any symptoms of the virus. It was the food. Vasnetsova posted a picture Thursday of what she said was “breakfast, lunch and dinner for five days already” — a tray with food including plain pasta, an orange sauce, charred meat on a bone, a few potatoes and no greens. She said she mostly survived on a few pieces of pasta because it was “impossible” to eat the rest, “but today I ate all the fat they serve instead of meat because I was very hungry.” She added she lost a lot of weight and “my bones are already sticking out.” The quarantine hotels are increasingly the target of criticism from athletes and their teams, who are lobbying organizers for improvements. There’s a lack of transparency, too, with only some virus-positive athletes forced into quarantine hotels where their teams don’t have access, while teammates in similar situations are allowed to isolate within the Olympic village. The rules for athletes who test positive say those without symptoms go to a dedicated hotel for isolation. Anyone who has COVID-19 with symptoms will go to a hospital. In both cases, they’ll be unable to compete until cleared for discharge. Teams have started going public with criticism. After Eric Frenzel, a three-time gold medalist in Nordic combined, tested positive, German delegation head Dirk Schimmelpfennig lambasted the “unreasonable” living conditions. Germany wants larger, more hygienic rooms, and more regular food deliveries so athletes who are eventually released are still fit to compete, Schimmelpfennig said in comments reported by the FAZ newspaper. The pressure can pay off. Belgian skeleton racer Kim Meylemans was brought back from a quarantine hotel to isolation in the athletes’ village after she made a tearful post on social media. Her main gripe was the lack of information. She was loaded into an ambulance and transported from one quarantine facility to another on a day she thought she was being released. Vasnetsova passed her time in quarantine with a little detective work. When fetching the food left outside her door, she took a glance at the boxes left outside other rooms in her corridor, whose doors were labeled with signs to distinguish Olympians from other people working at the Games who tested positive, such as team staff. She concluded the athletes were getting worse food, and underlined it with a picture of food served to her team doctor, who had also tested positive and was living two floors below. He had fresh fruit, a salad and prawns with broccoli. “I honestly don’t understand, why is there this attitude to us, the athletes?!” she wrote. Two days on from her criticism, Vasnetsova is still in quarantine but things are looking up. Russian biathlon team spokesman Sergei Averyanov posted a picture of what he said was an improved meal delivered to Vasnetsova’s room including salmon, cucumbers, sausages and yoghurt. A stationary bike will be delivered soon, he added. Vasnetsova, he wrote, “is already smiling, and that’s the main thing.”"
2,Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin Confronted For Not Wearing Mask In Grocery Store,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) was confronted by a grocery store customer on Thursday for declining to wear a mask inside, several videos of the exchange show. Youngkin, an opponent of COVID-19 mask mandates, was at an Alexandria, Virginia, Safeway to promote his plan to eliminate the state’s grocery tax when a nearby woman called him out for endangering others. “Governor, where’s your mask?” the woman called across the checkout aisles to Youngkin, who appeared to be one of the only unmasked people in the store. “We’re all making choices today,” replied Youngkin, who was being taught how to ring up items by a masked grocery store worker. While promoting his plan to eliminate grocery taxes, a customer strongly expressed disapproval over a maskless Youngkin. ""Governor, where is your mask?""""We're all making choices today.""""Yeah, look around you governor, you're in Alexandria. Read the room buddy!""@wusa pic.twitter.com/zNkgFXppVs The woman fired back: “Yeah, look around you, governor. You’re in Alexandria. Read the room buddy!” Youngkin didn’t fare well with Alexandria voters in the November election, earning just 24% of the vote there while his Democratic opponent, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, won the rest. The city was also an early adopter of masking ordinances, though the city’s mayor said recently that enforcement is up to the state. Since taking office in last month, Youngkin has signed executive orders saying parents don’t need to make their children comply with local mask ordinances and rescinding the state’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all government employees. Virginia, like much of the country, is experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases right now, though they are down from the spike in mid-January. Though studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that booster shots significantly protect people from getting seriously ill from the omicron variant, the strain’s heightened transmissibility has still taken a toll on public health systems.

3,Vaccine Politics Upend Republican Orthodoxy On Unemployment Benefits,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Republican state lawmakers are abandoning a core economic policy in order to fight against the Biden administration’s push for mass vaccination. Six GOP-led states have made workers eligible for unemployment insurance if they’re fired or they quit after refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and Republicans are pushing similar bills in another 11 states, according to the Century Foundation, a liberal think tank that tracks unemployment policy. Letting workers qualify for unemployment insurance if they’re fired or if they voluntarily quit represents a dramatic reversal for Republicans. Generally, workers who quit their jobs or get fired for misconduct are ineligible for benefits, an aspect of unemployment policy that Republicans highlighted aggressively at the outset of the pandemic. In May 2020, Donald Trump’s administration urged states to yank benefits from workers who refused to go back to their jobs, and some states even set up special tip lines where employers could report workers who’d refused to return. Congress had created a special type of pandemic unemployment benefits for workers who aren’t traditionally covered under state laws — including workers who quit their jobs due because they faced a higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 — but the Trump administration stressed in its benefits Q&A that “voluntarily deciding to quit your job out of a general concern about exposure to COVID-19 does not make you eligible.” “In Tennessee, a woman who quits her job in order to protect herself and her family from domestic violence would not have the same legal protection as an individual who refuses to get vaccinated.” More broadly, Republicans at all levels complained that the extra benefits Congress enacted in response to the pandemic encouraged people to stay home instead of working. Republicans generally do not favor policies that allow more people to get unemployment benefits. In recent years, they’ve pushed for drug-testing requirements and have said giving people money not to work is harmful to employers and society in general. Now, however, Republicans in some states are saying that if you quit your job because you’re concerned about getting a vaccine that has been proven safe and effective, you can get benefits. “Under these policies, vaccine refusers without a medical or religious reason would get special treatment, as compared to other unemployment claimants,” the Century Foundation’s Samantha Wing and Andrew Stettner wrote in their report. “For example, in Tennessee, a woman who quits her job in order to protect herself and her family from domestic violence would not have the same legal protection as an individual who refuses to get vaccinated.” Wing and Stettner said “opening up UI benefits to vaccine refusers is quite a hypocritical turnaround” for states that cut off federal benefits last year amid complaints of a worker shortage. President Joe Biden’s administration sought to require all large employers to either make their workers get vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, but the White House withdrew the rule after the Supreme Court blocked it from taking effect. Nationally, Republicans have railed against Biden’s vaccine mandate, but congressional Republicans have not pushed for a new federal law allowing job-quitters to receive benefits. Florida changed its unemployment law in November as a direct response to the Biden vaccine rule. The law disallows private employers from requiring their workers to get shots, and a less-noticed provision says refusing to do so won’t count as misconduct to disqualify someone from receiving benefits. “Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,” the state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said at the time.

4,"Stopping Pandemics Costs 95% Less Than Dealing With Them, Study Finds",coronavirus," Environment Reporter, HuffPost New research reinforces the old adage that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” when it comes to preventing future pandemics. With the world now entering its third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a team of 20 experts have released a “blueprint” for stopping animal-borne pathogens from spilling over into humans. The study, led by Harvard University researchers and published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, finds that implementing just three pandemic prevention strategies — halting deforestation, improving disease monitoring and surveillance, and better managing the wildlife trade — would cost a fraction of the annual economic and human losses that result from emerging infectious diseases. Less than 5%, to be exact ― and that’s a conservative estimate. Aaron Bernstein, the study’s lead author and director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, said during a call with reporters this week that given the world’s ongoing experience with COVID-19, it would be foolish not to invest in an alternative path that costs 5 cents on the dollar. “Our salvation comes cheap,” he said. Pathogens that spread from animals to humans are known as zoonotic diseases, and scientists warn that the threat of transmission is increasing as humans destroy ecosystems and exploit wildlife. The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have started when the novel coronavirus leapt from bats to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has so far killed more than 5.7 million people worldwide, including nearly 900,000 in the United States, and could cost the global economy $12.5 trillion through 2024. “Even if we were to reduce the risk of a bad pandemic by 1%, these measures would be cost-effective.” For its study, the Harvard-led team reviewed mortality data for all emerging zoonotic diseases that killed at least 10 people dating back to the 1918 Spanish flu. It concludes that with today’s population, 3.3 million people are expected to die each year from virus outbreaks. This loss of life translates to between $350 billion to $21 trillion annually, depending on different monetary estimates for the value of an individual human life. On top of that, disease outbreaks cause an estimated $212 billion annually in direct economic losses, according to the study. By comparison, advancing techniques to avert future outbreaks, which the report identifies as “primary pandemic prevention,” would cost an estimated $20 billion annually. And it wouldn’t take much for this kind of global investment to pay off. “Even if we were to reduce the risk of a bad pandemic by 1%, these measures would be cost-effective,” Bernstein said. “These measures have to be very modestly effective to justify their value.” The study makes a clear case for shifting resources from pandemic preparedness and response to early prevention. The authors argue that the world is going about fighting emerging zoonotic diseases all wrong, focusing on vaccines, testing and other post-outbreak actions while largely ignoring ways to stamp out the next pandemic before it starts. “Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail, ‘detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats,’” the report states. “In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree.” Stuart Pimm, a study author and ecology professor at Duke University, said it is obvious that the tools for battling COVID-19 are far from perfect. “Only 60% of Americans are vaccinated. We’re not getting vaccines anywhere near the numbers we need to to people in poor countries,” he said. “We need to start thinking about preventions. Those preventions are broadly things that we know how to do, and broadly things that we could implement quite quickly.” Deforestation and other land-use changes are the single biggest driver of zoonotic disease outbreaks that have occurred since 1940, a 2015 study found. At the United Nations’ climate conference last year in Scotland, more than 100 nations, including Brazil, the U.S., Canada and Russia, signed an initiative to halt deforestation by the end of the decade. But a similar pact in 2014 did little to slow the razing of the world’s forests. The new study notes that refocusing global pandemic efforts toward prevention would come with significant additional benefits, including preventing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, protecting water supplies and safeguarding biodiversity. Bernstein argues that the world’s current approach for dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases would be akin to confronting climate change solely through adaptation, without any mitigation. “If we were living on a planet with a stable climate and an intact biosphere, we might be able to afford waiting until disaster happens and trying to contain it,” he said. “But the reality is we don’t, and to operate on that premise is one of the greatest pieces of folly in modern times. To ignore the reality that the driver of disease emergence has to do with tumult in the living world and how we’re doing business with it, is really shocking in this day and age. And we simply cannot afford to take a post-spillover approach alone.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
5,My Toddler Tested Positive For COVID On The Same Day As Pfizer's Latest Announcement,coronavirus," Guest Writer On Feb. 1, I woke up a bit excited. After a difficult January during which parents across the country experienced what was possibly the highest level of anxiety since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic — due to the omicron variant sweeping the nation — the numbers were finally beginning to trend downward. Meanwhile, in my own home, my toddler thankfully had avoided catching COVID when half of his day care classroom got it earlier in the month and was back at school. Making my morning even better was reading the news that the COVID vaccine from Pfizer may be available for children under 5 by the end of February. As someone who became a new parent at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, after giving birth at the end of the month, this was long-awaited news. I remember feeling so angry when, at the end of December 2021, it seemed like the vaccine for little ones was still many months away. But this morning’s news brought a welcome relief from the intense worries I’ve had since having my now-22-month-old. And then… he tested positive. The same morning of the Pfizer announcement, my husband and I opened the at-home COVID tests we had received the previous week from the U.S. government. We were glad to have avoided testing positive after my son’s last COVID exposure, so we didn’t think anything of it when he was extra fussy the night before and had a slightly elevated body temperature. Yet out of an abundance of caution, we decided to test him. The second line on the at-home test became visible within a few minutes. Like, really, really visible. My son — who I’ve done my best to protect from a coronavirus that has caused the deaths of 5.7 million people worldwide — was now yet another confirmed case of COVID. After these last two years of fear and avoiding friends and family to keep him safe, I thought my heart would sink and I would have a panic attack like I had in the last few weeks of pregnancy when news of partners not being allowed in birthing hospital rooms spread. Instead, seeing my son’s positive COVID test gave me an eerie sense of calm. I’ve been worrying about this for two years. Like pretty much every other parent I knew, hearing from well-meaning family and friends who wanted to meet the new baby that “most kids don’t get very sick” was not even remotely comforting. As I frequently said to my husband, “Even if the chances are one in a million, if my son is the one in a million that dies, it won’t matter that other kids are fine.” The decision to put our son in day care — which was necessary as two working parents with demanding jobs — worried me. I even considered keeping him home during the omicron surge, but I knew this would be a disaster for my already flailing mental health. So instead, we did our best to isolate and avoid everyone. How could I possibly be feeling relieved when the thing I was terrified of for almost two years had come to pass? And yet, I was. The truth is that, at the end of last year, getting COVID began to feel inevitable. Friends from New York told me that everyone they knew had it at the end of December. Friends across the country with young and older kids were exposed every few days. Someone told me they didn’t know a single parent who had survived the month of January 2022 without a COVID exposure. A friend who got COVID along with her baby during the week of his first birthday said, “I feel like I did everything right and still got it.” I understood her. We were constantly doing the best we could, following the advice of our doctors and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and taking what felt like all of the precautions even when others around us didn’t. “I am just so exhausted,” my husband said at the beginning of this year. Everywhere I looked, parents — especially those of us who had children under 5 that did not yet qualify for the COVID vaccine — were wholly burnt out as January began. Tired of not being able to leave the house, tired of not getting enough sleep, tired of paying extra for grocery delivery, tired of cooking every single damn day, tired of not being able to see friends and family much, tired of (let’s say it) wearing masks even though we know it’s the right thing to do, tired of worrying and worrying and worrying some more. When will it ever stop? For me, the worries stopped on Tuesday morning as soon as that second test line appeared. Years ago, when my husband and I helped with a neighbor’s dog who had just gotten into a fight and ultimately lost an eye, he commented on how calm I was in a crisis — the opposite of my usual self. And I guess that same calmness washed over me once we knew what the situation was. My son seemed to be in a good mood that morning, if I’m honest, and has only had a slight fever for a few days at this point. We still have some time to go before he’s fully cleared. Still, my sense of relief didn’t come from his mild symptoms (though I am happy for those) but rather from the fact that my brain went from constantly ruminating on the “what ifs?” of getting COVID to instead dealing with the situation at hand. For the first time in two years, I am focused on the present: his symptoms, how to manage to work with a toddler in isolation (yet again), and alerting our day care so it can protect the other kids. Ultimately, I am a bit annoyed that we couldn’t make it another few weeks to when my son might be able to get the vaccine but, at the same time, now that it has finally happened for my family, I feel OK. In a few weeks, once the COVID vaccine is hopefully available for children under 5, we will get my son vaccinated. Although we don’t know if or when the next variant is coming, knowing that my baby both survived COVID and is now fully protected against further infections, well, that is truly when I’ll feel relieved.

6,"Europe Entering 'Plausible Endgame' To COVID Pandemic, WHO Says",coronavirus," COPENHAGEN (AP) — The director of the World Health Organization’s Europe office said Thursday the continent is now entering a “plausible endgame” to the pandemic and that the number of coronavirus deaths is starting to plateau. Dr. Hans Kluge said at a media briefing that there is a “singular opportunity” for countries across Europe to take control of COVID-19 transmission due to three factors: high levels of immunization due to vaccination and natural infection, the virus’s tendency to spread less in warmer weather and the lower severity of the omicron variant. “This period of higher protection should be seen as a cease-fire that could bring us enduring peace,” he said. As the winter subsides in much of Europe in the coming weeks, when the virus’s transmission naturally drops, Kluge said the upcoming spring “leaves us with the possibility for a long period of tranquility and a much higher level of population defense against any resurgence in transmission.” Even if another variant emerges, Kluge said, health authorities in Europe should be able to keep it in check, provided immunization and boosting efforts continue, along with other public health interventions. He said, however, this demands “a drastic and uncompromising increase in vaccine-sharing across borders,” saying vaccines must be provided to everyone across Europe and beyond. Scientists have repeatedly warned that unless the majority of the world’s population is vaccinated, any opportunities for COVID-19 to keep spreading means it could mutate into deadlier and more transmissible forms. Numerous countries across Europe, including Britain  and Denmark, have dropped nearly all their coronavirus restrictions after saying that omicron has peaked. Others, including Spain, are now considering whether to consider COVID-19 to be an endemic problem that might be handled more like seasonal flu. At WHO’s Geneva headquarters, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the world as a whole is still far from exiting the pandemic. “We are concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines — and because of omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity — preventing transmission is no longer possible and no longer necessary,” Tedros said Tuesday. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” The agency has said even countries with high levels of vaccination should not succumb to political pressure and release all of their coronavirus measures at once. Kluge noted that there were 12 million new coronavirus cases across WHO’s European region last week, the highest single weekly total during the pandemic. He said that spike was driven by the hugely infectious omicron variant, but admissions to hospital intensive care units haven’t risen significantly. ___ Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic"
7,Stark Photos Show What Life Is Like Inside The Beijing Olympics COVID Bubble,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — From the moment participants at the Beijing Olympics step off the plane, they enter the “bubble” — a system of strict containment measures that aims to keep the coronavirus at bay for the duration of the Games. It all starts at the airport, where workers in full-body white suits lead athletes, their coaches and others through entry procedures, including the first of daily COVID-19 tests. Participants are only allowed to shuttle between Olympic venues and their accommodation, all on specially reserved buses. Everywhere workers spray disinfectant, while bubble residents track their temperature, stay alert for any symptoms and repeatedly test for the virus. The goal? To keep those attending the Games completely separate from the wider Chinese population, all while keeping infections to a minimum inside the bubble. At each hotel and venue, fences mark off a perimeter beyond which those inside the bubble cannot stray. Those inside peer out at a city they cannot visit. Those outside peer into an event they will experience only on television."
8,Olympian Released From Beijing Isolation Facility After Emotional Video Plea,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Kim Meylemans thought she was going to the Olympic Village. She wound up in tears instead. Such was the start of a few confusing hours for the women’s skeleton athlete from Belgium — whose trip into what would have been a second round of isolation underscored the fears many had about the Beijing Olympics and what happens after someone tests positive for COVID-19. Her tale went like this: A positive test upon her arrival in Beijing led to a three-day stay in isolation, which she thought was ending Wednesday after she returned multiple negative tests. But when the ambulance that she thought was taking her to the village drove past it, panic set in because Meylemans didn’t know what was happening. A teary social-media post brought immediate attention, and hours later, Meylemans was transported to the village. A post shared by Kim Meylemans (@kimmeylemans) “I am now in a wing that’s just isolation, but at least I’m back in the village,” Meylemans said Thursday. “I feel safe and I’ll be able to train a little better here.” The scenario is one that had many questioning whether coming to the Beijing Games was worth it, with isolation — and for an indefinite period — a very real possibility for anyone testing positive in China, where zero tolerance for the coronavirus is the rule. “It’s so confusing,” U.S. bobsledder Kaillie Humphries said of all the unknowns surrounding the aftermath of positive tests. “It’s very frustrating. It’s scary.” Meylemans’ story, at least this chapter of it, has a happy ending. She is where she wants to be and is expected to make the women’s skeleton field on Feb. 12. She has a reasonable chance of contending for a medal if she slides well. The International Olympic Committee said her brief trip to a second isolation facility was caused by simple logistics, that no room in the village was ready for her. Others, like athlete advocate Rob Koehler, believe her social media post aided her cause. “Of course, we’re worried,” said Koehler, director general of the athlete-advocate group Global Athlete. “We’re worried about the entire COVID-19 protocol. We’re worried about the quarantine facilities and we’re worried about everything that’s not published, which is the details, and the devil is always in the details. They haven’t been well-informed and it hasn’t been transparent.” Meylemans put her confusion on display for the world to see Wednesday, her face and eyes red from crying, her words doing nothing to hide her fear and frustration over the unknown. She will still need twice-daily testing for a week before she can leave the isolation wing in the village. “Our main goal was to get Kim to the Olympic Village in Yanqing as quickly as possible,” Belgian Olympic delegation leader Olav Spahl said. “We are therefore very pleased that this has now been successfully achieved. We understand that the COVID measures are necessary to safeguard the safety and health of participants in the Games, but we believe that the athlete should always be at the center of such an approach.” IOC member Juan-Antonio Samaranch, who leads the committee overseeing preparations for the Beijing Games, told other members Thursday that “isolation centers’ quality has been dramatically improved” and that more improvements are still needed. “Relieved to hear that Kim Meylemans is now in the Olympic Village,” IOC spokesman Christian Klaue tweeted. “We are glad that all the efforts led to the successful resolution of this situation.” Meylemans is considered a “close contact” by the IOC, meaning she can train and compete while living in the Olympic Village but needs to be in a single room, transported by herself and eat alone. “Since there was no such room directly available, she was temporarily accommodated in a hotel close to the Olympic Village. It is a facility which is dedicated to close contacts in order for them to meet all the criteria to continue to train and compete,” the IOC said. Humphries can relate to some of what Meylemans is feeling. She tested positive for COVID-19 last month and is staying in a hotel until she gets fully cleared. She can train — her sledmate, Kaysha Love, had to sign a waiver just to be with Humphries for those on-ice sessions — but won’t be allowed in the Olympic Village until next week and will miss Friday’s opening ceremony. Humphries nearly missed a training session earlier this week because her taxi got stuck in traffic. Another U.S. women’s bobsledder, Elana Meyers Taylor — like Humphries, someone who could be a serious medal contender — remains in isolation after a positive test, though she still has hopes of competing in her two events. “It’s been very difficult,” Humphries said. Meylemans finished 14th in her Olympic debut at Pyeongchang in 2018. She has one medal from World Cup races this season, a bronze, and placed no worse than sixth in five of the final six races on the circuit this season. Official training for women’s skeleton starts next week. At one point Wednesday, Meylemans’ plans to compete seemed in doubt. By early Thursday, the outlook was considerably brighter and Meylemans said she was thankful for the support her teary post generated. She said she planned to respond to every message, which will take some time. “Luckily,” she wrote, “I have plenty of time in isolation still.” AP National Writer Eddie Pells and AP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar contributed to this report."
9,LA Mayor Eric Garcetti Defends Maskless Photo With Magic Johnson: ‘I Hold My Breath’,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) defended himself from criticism for flouting COVID safety protocols by posing maskless for a photo with NBA legend Magic Johnson during the NFC Championship game over the weekend. He said he held his breath, so there was “a zero percent chance of infection.” “I wore my mask for the entire game. When people ask for a photograph, I hold my breath and I put it (the mask) here and people can see that,” Garcetti, who is President Joe Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to India, told reporters on Wednesday. Watch the video here: California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and San Francisco Mayor London Breed (D) drew similar criticism for removing their masks during the Los Angeles Rams-San Francisco 49ers game at the SoFi stadium. Masks are still mandatory in Los Angeles County for “everyone 2 years of age and older” in “all indoor public places and at outdoor Mega Events, whether they have been vaccinated or not,” per Los Angeles County Public Health. While scientists have said holding breath may reduce the risk of contracting the virus, it isn’t a fail-safe method. Garcetti’s explanation rang hollow for some, given how it came during a news conference outside the stadium promoting coronavirus safety for next weekend’s Super Bowl between the Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals.

0,The Best Foods To Help Relieve Symptoms Of Breakthrough COVID,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost The rise of the COVID-19 omicron variant has resulted in many vaccinated and boosted people testing positive. And, as someone who contracted both the alpha variant (back in January 2021, before vaccinations were widely available) and the omicron variant this year, I can say firsthand that the COVID symptoms that I dealt with post-vax were far milder and shorter-term. Most notably, I was able to keep food down during my omicron outbreak (unlike the alpha experience, which left me constantly nauseated and unable to smell or taste what I was eating). This felt like a massive relief, but when I went to place grocery delivery orders while quarantining, I did wonder whether there might be specific food items that could help boost my energy and ease my cold-like symptoms. This curiosity led me to consult some licensed nutritionists, who shared recommendations for seven food and drink items that can make breakthrough COVID easier to manage for people of all ages. Even though my own personal experience with an omicron breakthrough didn’t involve nausea, an unsettled stomach is still a common COVID symptom. For that reason, it makes sense that easy-to-eat (and easy-to-digest) foods like vegetable soup were popular recommendations from our nutritionist sources. “Warm vegetable soup with a side of protein (like chicken or tofu) is my top choice because the vegetables will provide plenty of extra vitamins and minerals, which are especially essential in times of illness,” registered dietician Morgyn Clair said. Also, “if someone is suffering from a sore throat or congestion, the warm fluids can help soothe these symptoms and help break up phlegm,” Clair explained. She advises the protein addition because it “supports healthy immune function, since all enzymes in the body are made up of proteins.” Another soup that makes a smart menu addition for those grappling with breakthrough COVID is bone broth (or, if you’re on a plant-based diet, vegan “bone broth”). Registered nutritionist Paula Doebrich told HuffPost that “most people experience poor appetite when they get COVID, so soup is an excellent way to get nutrients in. Making it with bone broth adds valuable nutrients, such as a higher protein content, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iron and other minerals. Many of these nutrients are needed for the immune system to function properly.” Dr. Frank Lipman, chief medical officer of The Well in New York City, described bone broth as “hydrating, nutrient-rich and supportive [of] immunity.” It makes a great dietary addition for adults with COVID, he said, and is an easy form of sustenance for COVID-positive children who may find their appetites compromised by their illness. “The best thing you can do for your kids’ health is avoid feeding them processed, sugary foods that lead to systemic inflammation and compromise immune function,” Lipman said. When looking for vitamin-rich foods to eat during a COVID infection, “go for berries, which are packed with antioxidants such as quercetin and vitamin C,” said registered dietician and certified dietician nutritionist Linda Altenburger of the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York. “ These are necessary to reduce inflammation and provide resistance to infection by boosting immunity.” Berries, explained Altenburger, “contain powerful antioxidants, called flavonoids, that are responsible for providing immune-boosting benefits.” Flavonoids can “reduce free radical formation and oxidative damage, and contain anti-viral properties.” While the scientific community is still studying the effect of flavonoids on COVID outbreaks, the National Institutes of Health says they’ve shown “promising evidence” against COVID, “thereby reducing severity of illness.” So, go ahead and add blueberries, raspberries, strawberries or any other berry to your shopping list. They’re also crowd-pleasers with children, and work well when you’re trying to urge your COVID-positive child to eat. Oatmeal is an excellent source of fiber, which “helps nourish the good bacteria in our microbiome and [sends] anti-inflammatory and virus-fighting signals to the immune system,” according to owner, licensed nutritionist and head of research Shawn M. Talbott of Amare Wellness Center in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Plus, it’s easy to zhuzh up oatmeal in healthy (and kid-friendly) ways. Talbott recommends adding “a handful of blueberries and a scoop of whole-fat yogurt.” Many of the symptoms associated with breakthrough COVID infections resemble those of the common cold, from congestion to coughs to sore throats. Citrus fruits like lemons, limes, grapefruits and oranges are often recommended for cold patients. “They’re a great source of vitamin C, a helpful antioxidant commonly known to boost the immune system,” explained Jay Cowin, a registered nutritionist. “These same properties also make citrus fruits a wise choice for COVID patients. Vitamin C can also reduce and even prevent catching a cold; it may help fight off the infections faster and prevent any complications that these viruses might cause,” Cowin pointed out that “citrus fruits are affordable, convenient and can easily be enjoyed by adults and kids. They can be eaten or drunk, making them easy to consume even with a sore throat. There’s no magic food that can completely protect us from any virus, but the best thing we can do is consume things that can help strengthen our immune system to fight off these diseases.” If you (like me) find yourself with a decent appetite in spite of breakthrough COVID, then consider adding a heartier source of protein to your diet, like wild salmon. “Oily fish such as salmon are packed full of healthy fats,” said certified nutritionist Reda Elmardi. She noted that “omega-3 fish oil, which wild salmon contains, is a potent anti-inflammatory, which means it can play a key role in [treating] COVID cases, as has been shown in this study.” For adults and children dealing with COVID, hydration proves crucially important. “Water performs many vital functions in the body,” explained registered dietician Lyndsay Hall. “Being even slightly dehydrated can lead to or make worse the feelings of fatigue often associated with breakthrough COVID-19 symptoms.” A fluid loss of just 1% to 3% can impact mental sharpness, focus and energy — all likely already compromised by a virus. Mancuso recommends “sipping on water throughout the day to keep you well-hydrated. If drinking water on its own is not up to your liking, try adding a slice of lemon for some zest. Tea performs a similar function to water.” If your COVID-positive kids have trouble drinking water (or simply prefer sweeter or more flavorful beverages), try Pedialyte, which registered dietician Ricci-Lee Hotz describes as “helpful for children experiencing fever who are having difficulty drinking enough liquid.” On Assignment For HuffPost"
1,6 Myths About Donating Blood Right Now,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost With a national blood shortage during an ongoing pandemic, the United States is in dire need of people to roll up their sleeves to spare a vein for an hour. But many potential donors inaccurately think they can’t donate — mostly because of notions that may have once been true but are no longer relevant, or that weren’t accurate in the first place. There are, however, still restrictions on queer individuals, which many advocates are fighting against. Below are just a few common misconceptions about blood donation guidelines. Read through so you can get to donating, worry-free, if you are eligible. Many people with tattoos assume they can’t — or have to wait months ― to donate blood, but that’s not quite accurate. “Different states have different regulations regarding inspection of the parlors,” said Dr. Yvette Miller, executive medical officer of the American Red Cross. “If a person received a tattoo in a state that performs an inspection of the facility, then there’s no deferral period. In states where there are no statutes where the tattoo parlor is inspected by the state, then it is a three-month deferral from the date of the tattoo.” So if you received your tattoo in an inspected parlor, you’re good to go. If your friend gave you a stick-and-poke, hold off for three months. Being an international traveler doesn’t prevent you from giving blood. Only one specific travel rule exists. “The travel restrictions are around malaria,” Miller said. “If a person spends 24 hours or more traveling to or through a malaria-endemic area, it’s a three-month deferral from when they return to a non-malaria-endemic area.” If you were born or have lived outside the U.S., there’s a little more to it regarding Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is related to “mad cow” disease. That information is available on the Red Cross website if it applies to you. Quite the opposite, actually. In most cases, you don’t even have to wait. “COVID-19 vaccines that are acceptable without any deferral periods are the ones that have been approved by the FDA,” Miller said. And those not approved by the Food and Drug Administration? There are still vaccine trials occurring on things like live attenuated vaccines. So if a potential donor has received such a vaccine, they must wait 14 days before donating — but they aren’t disqualified. “We absolutely care about and take extremely seriously the health and welfare of our donors.” Most individuals 17 years old and up can donate without parental consent, as long as they meet the height and weight requirements. Everyone, regardless of age, must weigh at least 110 pounds. “For the American Red Cross, we don’t have an upper age limit,” Miller added. “In terms of the younger age range, in any state, an individual that is 16 years old can donate” as long as they have written parental consent. If you currently have COVID-19 or are displaying COVID-like symptoms, do not attempt to donate blood. You should be resting and isolating. But just because you’ve had COVID-19 in the past doesn’t mean you can’t donate blood in the future. Donors “have to be symptom-free for 14 days from the last day that they had any type of symptoms,” Miller said. And if you can’t remember the last day you had symptoms? “We don’t want to pressure people into trying to remember something that they can’t. But let me just say, in my experience over the last two years, people definitely know when they start feeling better,” Miller said. As long as you’re taking standard precautions against COVID-19 (hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing), donating blood will not put you at a higher risk of infection. And it won’t increase your exposure any more than the general risk from leaving the house, nor will it weaken your immune system. “There’s no evidence that donating blood has an effect on the immune system to increase personal susceptibility to COVID-19,” Miller said. It does decrease a person’s iron, however. Before donating, a donor’s iron levels are tested, and a person can’t donate if their levels are too low. Similarly, donors are encouraged to take a multivitamin after giving blood to replenish their iron supply. But one thing that’s not a myth? Certain medications can’t be taken before donating, such as blood thinners or experimental drugs. A full deferral list is provided on the Red Cross website. “One of our responsibilities to donors is that we want you to be the healthiest that you can be,” Miller said. “We would never recommend or sanction a person stopping a medication to donate blood. That is completely inappropriate.” If you’re able, and hopefully you’re willing, go to a donation center or blood bank near you. Help fight the current blood shortage so we can take care of each other. Use the Red Cross website to find a location or search for blood banks in your area. Often, local college campuses will also host drives. But be sure to take care of yourself first. “We absolutely care about and take extremely seriously the health and welfare of our donors,” Miller said. On Assignment For HuffPost"
2,Danish Men's Olympic Hockey Team Hit By Multiple COVID Cases,coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Denmark’s men’s hockey team held its first pre-Olympic practice Wednesday without six players after a spate of positive COVID-19 test results upon arriving in China. The Danish Olympic federation announced that forwards Matthias Asperup and Nick Olesen tested positive for the coronavirus and went into isolation. Former NHL forward Mikkel Boedker, veteran defenseman Markus Lauridsen and two taxi squad players also missed practice after testing positive, though the team believed the results to be inaccurate and expected them back on the ice soon. “Fortunately, it looks like four of them were false positive, we are hoping,” longtime NHL center Frans Nielsen said. ”I wouldn’t called it ‘scared,’ but you’re always worried about, ‘Is there going to be more?’” Coach Heinz Ehlers expressed optimism about getting four of the players out of isolation late Wednesday or early Thursday. The National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark said it did not believe any other members of the nation’s 62-person delegation would need to be isolated. Ehlers said everyone on Denmark’s men’s hockey team tested negative twice within the previous 48 hours before leaving for Beijing. Asperup and Olesen need to produce two negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart to be cleared to rejoin the team. “Of course it’s frustrating about the practice because we were supposed to do a little bit of power play today and three or four of those players, they were out,” Ehlers said. “It’s just (we have) to accept the way it is right now.” The tournament begins in a week. Denmark plays its first game Feb. 9 against the Czech Republic. Denmark qualified in men’s and women’s hockey at the Olympics for the first time. “I think with every team right now, all you can do is cross your fingers and hope that we’re going to get through this tournament without too many positive cases,” Nielsen said. Ukrainian biathlete Olena Bilosiuk, a gold medalist in the women’s relay in 2014, also tested positive in Beijing. Coach Uros Velepec told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne that Bilosiuk had a fever but was otherwise well. Biathlon competitions begin Saturday with the mixed relay. Beijing organizers on Wednesday reported 32 new cases — 15 in tests of people arriving at the airport and 17 within the Olympic bubbles. Athletes and team officials accounted for nine of the latest cases and 23 were “stakeholders,” a category that includes workers and media. Eleven people have been treated at the hospital for a symptom among the 232 positive tests registered since Jan. 23, though “none of those are seriously ill in any way,” Olympic medical adviser Brian McCloskey said."
3,8 Sleep Tips To Try If You Have COVID,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Every muscle in my back, hips and legs ached. I was shaking and shivering uncontrollably, despite the three blankets I was buried under. My head throbbed, my throat was scratchy and I felt downright miserable — my breakthrough COVID-19 infection was no joke. But the worst part of all? Despite how fatigued I felt, sleep seemed to be just out of reach. Any time you’re sick, sleeping can be more difficult. A COVID infection is no different, said Dr. Heather Moday, an immunologist and author of “The Immunotype Breakthrough.” “Whether it’s a breakthrough COVID infection or an infection of an unvaccinated person, either can cause disruptions of sleep,” she explained. “The issue is the severity of symptoms. People with breakthrough infections tend to have milder symptoms of aches, fever, cough and fatigue compared to the unvaccinated. But these symptoms may still be there to some degree. All of these symptoms may make it more difficult to get comfortable and stay asleep.” How can you cope? If counting sheep isn’t cutting it, try these tips to get better sleep when you’re COVID-19 positive. Before you go to bed, take a hot shower, said Dr. Lucy McBride, an internist based in Washington, D.C. Get the water warm enough to create steam. This is a great way to “loosen up congestion,” she explained. McBride also suggested managing symptoms with over-the-counter cough medications and fever reducers (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen), as long as they don’t interfere with any other medications you’re taking. Beware of using decongestants in the evening, though, “as these contain ingredients that have stimulant properties and may keep you awake at night,” said Dr. Sonya Merrill, a sleep medicine specialist on the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas medical staff. Taking a small dose of melatonin at bedtime might be helpful as well, Moday said, as it “not only helps ramp up your immune system overnight, but also helps improve circadian rhythm by opposing the stress hormone cortisol and telling your body it’s time for sleep.” Just be sure to chat with your doctor before starting any new medication. Merrill recommended sleeping with your head and neck elevated, to “improve breathing and reduce mucus pooling in the back of your throat.” You can do this by lying on a few pillows or adding a proper neck pillow to your sleep arsenal. Merrill suggested drinking water to help thin mucus, a byproduct of the infection that can lead to rest-reducing issues like congestion and nasal drip. If your symptoms include vomiting or nausea, it’s especially important to stay hydrated. “You can drink coconut water or add some electrolyte tabs, such as Nuun brand, into very diluted fruit juice,” Moday said. “Commercial electrolyte drinks like Pedialyte are fine as well, but they do contain more sugar. Ginger can help tremendously with nausea, as can fennel.” Moday also suggested drinking honey and lemon tea, or tea with demulcent herbs (like slippery elm and licorice root). Make sure your room is an ideal place to rest. Merrill recommended using a humidifier set between 40% and 50% humidity “to improve nasal breathing.” Also, an optimal bedroom temperature for sleeping is “between 65 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit, as it is all the more important to keep the bedroom cool when you have a fever,” Merrill said. While you may be tempted to sleep the day away with COVID, chances are you’ll regret it come nighttime. “It’s OK to spend a little more time than usual in bed at night, as you may need more sleep while battling a virus,” Merrill said. “However, avoid spending excessive time in bed during the day and taking long naps. These behaviors often make it harder for you to sleep at night.” Instead, Merrill suggested finding a comfortable place to rest during the day, such as a recliner or couch outside your bedroom, and setting a timer to ensure you don’t nap longer than 30 minutes. While sharing a bed with someone may be your norm, it’s probably not a good idea while you’re fighting a COVID infection. Not only may having a bed partner keep you awake, but if you test positive for COVID-19, you should isolate from others for at least five days until you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your symptoms are improving. “Generally, quarantining from your partner is still recommended with breakthrough cases of COVID-19 even if they are vaccinated and especially if they have a negative test,” Moday said. “Given the highly transmissible nature of the omicron variant, they have a very high change of getting infected if you don’t.” McBride acknowledged that isolating from very young children may not be possible. “Personally, I would have a very hard time isolating from my very young child if he/she had COVID,” she said. “We have to balance the potential harm of getting a breakthrough infection from our child — which for most vaccinated people is like a cold or a flu — against the harms of leaving a sick child alone.” If vomiting keeps you up all night, your cough is accelerating, or you’re having difficulty breathing, McBride said it’s time to call your physician. “Even breakthrough COVID infections can sometimes cause pneumonia,” she said, “so it’s important to always talk with your own doctor.” On Assignment For HuffPost"
4,Sharon Stone Scorches Joe Rogan With A Damning Disclaimer For His Podcast,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Actor Sharon Stone suggested another disclaimer that Joe Rogan should add to his hugely popular podcast, following rising controversy over his show’s misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines. “He should put a disclaimer that he’s an asshole and that his behavior is dangerous,” Stone told TMZ on Tuesday. “COVID is not an opinion-based situation,” she added, accusing Rogan of “risking people’s lives with his idiocy.” “Infectious diseases are science and they are fact-based situations, so the pretense that these are opinions is dangerous and his behavior is dangerous,” added the “Basic Instinct” star, known off screen for her humanitarian work against AIDS. Stone’s “adopted grandmother” Eileen Mitzman died after contracting the coronavirus. The actor’s sister meanwhile was hospitalized. Last week, rock icon Neil Young, followed by Joni Mitchell and other high-profile artists, pulled their music from Spotify — which hosts Rogan’s show — in protest of the misinformation frequently peddled by his guests. Stone backed the move: I’m w @Neilyoung cancel my @Spotify accounts in the name of Truth❣️ Amid mounting scrutiny, Rogan on Sunday offered an apology of sorts for any offense caused by his show. Spotify said it would add a content advisory to his podcasts talking about the pandemic. On Monday, though, Rogan tweeted and then deleted an incorrect story about treating the virus.

5,Pfizer Asks FDA To Approve COVID-19 Vaccine For Kids Under 5,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Pfizer on Tuesday asked the U.S. to authorize extra-low doses of its COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5, potentially opening the way for the very youngest Americans to start receiving shots as early as March. In an extraordinary move, the Food and Drug Administration had urged Pfizer and its partner BioNTech to apply earlier than the companies had planned. The nation’s 19 million children under 5 are the only group not yet eligible for vaccination against the coronavirus. Many parents have been pushing for an expansion of shots to toddlers and preschoolers, especially as the omicron wave sent record numbers of youngsters to the hospital. If the FDA agrees, Pfizer shots containing just one-tenth of the dose given to adults could be dispensed to children as young as 6 months. An open question is how many shots those youngsters will need. Pfizer is testing three shots after two of the extra-low doses turned out to be strong enough for babies but not for preschoolers, and the final data from the study isn’t expected until late March. That means the FDA may consider whether to authorize two shots for now, with potentially a third shot being cleared later if the study supports it. The agency’s decision could come within weeks, but that isn’t the only hurdle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has to sign off. The Biden administration has been trying to speed the authorization of COVID-19 shots for children, contending vaccinations are critical for opening schools and day care centers and keeping them open, and for freeing up parents from child care duties so they can go back to work. Yet vaccination rates have been lower among children than in other age groups. As of last week, just 20% of kids ages 5 to 11 and just over half of 12- to 17-year-olds were fully vaccinated, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nearly three-quarters of adults are fully vaccinated. While young children are far less likely than adults to get severely ill from the coronavirus, it can happen, and pediatric COVID-19 infections are higher than at any other point in the pandemic. “What we’re seeing right now is still a lot of hospitalizations and unfortunately some deaths in this age group,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the University of Colorado, who is on the AAP’s infectious disease committee. If the FDA clears vaccinations for these youngsters, “that’s going to be really important because all of those hospitalizations and deaths essentially are preventable.” For kids under 5, Pfizer’s study is giving participants two shots three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least two months later. The company is testing whether the youngsters produce antibody levels similar to those known to protect teens and young adults. In December, Pfizer announced that children under 2 looked to be protected but that the antibody response was too low in 2- to 4-year-olds. It’s not clear why, but one possibility is that the extra-low dose was a little too low for the preschoolers. Since the preliminary results showed the shots were safe, Pfizer added a third dose to the testing in hopes of improving protection. Given how well boosters are working for older age groups, “it makes some sense” that younger children could benefit from a third shot, O’Leary said. “I certainly can understand where both the company and the FDA are coming from in terms of wanting to move this along, anticipating that there’s going to be a third dose down the line.” ___ AP journalist Emma H.

6,5 New Things Experts Recently Discovered About COVID,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost What we know about COVID-19 seems to change by the minute. It’s understandable, given the massive scale of the pandemic. More than 379 million cases have been confirmed around the world since tracking began. And even now — as we’ve spent two full years living with the coronavirus — the virus and ways to address it are still relatively new to the medical world, so researchers are learning as they go. Still, the amount of information about the coronavirus is dizzying. It’s hard to keep track of what’s known, what’s a myth and what guidance we should follow. That’s why HuffPost has rounded up five of the most important new things we learned about COVID-19 in January. In January, researchers began closely tracking a new strain of the omicron variant, known as BA.2, which has already been confirmed in the United States. The news grabbed a lot of headlines and certainly sounds unsettling given how omicron has swept through much of the country. But experts have been clear that the new variant is not cause for panic yet. Also, they’ve known about it since December, but are tracking it more closely now because it is highly contagious — and spreading. While initial evidence suggests that BA.2 — or “the stealth variant” as some people are calling it — is 1.5 times more transmissible than the initial omicron variant, health officials say our vaccines are holding up well and continuing to protect people against the most serious outcomes. Plus, there’s no evidence at this point that BA.2 makes people any sicker than the initial omicron variant. That earlier omicron variant has certainly led to an explosion in cases nationwide, but generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. That said, mild and asymptomatic are not the same thing, and one can have “mild” illness and still feel pretty darn sick. At the very end of January, The Washington Post reported that the Pfizer vaccine might be available for children under the age of 5 far sooner than the drug manufacturer and health officials had previously estimated. Children in that age group could start getting their shots at the end of February, according to the report. For many months, health officials hoped young kids would be eligible for vaccination relatively early on in 2022. Then Pfizer released disappointing data showing that its two-shot regimen did not create a sufficient immune response (though the shots were safe). At that point, health officials and doctors began guessing that shots likely wouldn’t be available until the spring. The Washington Post reported that Pfizer is expected to apply for emergency use authorization for the vaccine as soon as this week, which could make the first shot available to younger children almost immediately. A January study identified four clues that someone is at particular risk of developing long-term symptoms after their initial COVID-19 infection. They include: having a higher viral load in their blood early in the infection; the presence of certain antibodies that help fight off the virus; reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus (which most people get infected with at some point in their lives); and having Type 2 diabetes. The vast majority of patients who developed long-haul COVID-19 in that study had at least one of those factors. Experts hope that by identifying risk factors for long-haul COVID-19 they will be better able to intervene early and help combat people’s symptoms over time. Though estimates are imprecise, it’s believed roughly 10% of people infected with COVID-19 develop long-term symptoms that can last for months. Several studies published in January offered reassurance to people trying to conceive. One investigation found that patients who are vaccinated and undergoing in vitro fertilization had no significant differences in their response to ovarian stimulation (when eggs are harvested), egg quality, embryo development or overall pregnancy outcomes. Another study looked at outcomes among more than 2,000 couples trying to conceive over the past year and found no differences in those who were vaccinated — though men who got COVID-19 seemed to experience a dip in their fertility for several months. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about the vaccines and about pregnancy,” Jane Frederick, a reproductive endocrinologist based in California, previously told HuffPost. “But we should be encouraging all of our pregnant patients and people who are thinking about fertility treatments to all get vaccinated and protect themselves.” The idea of swabbing your nose and throat when taking an at-home COVID-19 test went kind of viral in early January, and some health experts said it’s not a bad idea. The thinking? You could have different amounts of the virus in your nose versus in your throat — and throat samples could be better at detecting omicron, which tends to replicate more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract. But not everyone agrees. Test manufacturers, for one, say it’s important to use their tests exactly as directed or their results might not be reliable. And a recent non-peer-reviewed study suggests that when it comes to rapid antigen testing, throat swabs are less accurate than nasal swabs. That’s why groups like the Food and Drug Administration have said that people should use nasal swabs as directed, not throat swabs. In mid-January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said it’s just too soon to say whether swabbing both your throat and nose is a good idea. As has so often been the case throughout the pandemic, researchers and doctors are learning about best practices in real time. “There have been recent reports that, in fact, [there may be higher] sensitivity and ability to detect [the virus] in a swab of the throat versus the nasopharynx, at least with omicron,” Fauci told the Senate health committee. “I think it needs to be validated and verified.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

7,U.S. Bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor Tests Positive For COVID; Olympic Spot In Jeopardy,coronavirus," World Cup champion Elana Meyers Taylor’s quest to add to her Olympic medal total at the Beijing Games is in jeopardy after the veteran U.S. women’s bobsled pilot revealed Tuesday she has tested positive for COVID-19. USA Bobsled and Skeleton remains hopeful that Meyers Taylor will be able to compete at the Beijing Games, especially since bobsled doesn’t begin until about a week into the Olympics. Women’s monobob official training begins Feb. 10, with competition beginning Feb. 13. Training for the two-woman event starts Feb. 15, with competition beginning Feb. 18. “After arriving to Beijing on January 27, on January 29 I tested positive for Covid-19,” Meyers Taylor wrote on her social media platforms. “I am asymptomatic and currently at an isolation hotel- and yes I am completely isolated.” She revealed on Jan. 27 that she passed an initial test after arriving in Beijing. Meyers Taylor was planning to stay in a hotel and not the Olympic village, since she is traveling with her young son. “This is just the latest obstacle that my family and I have faced on this journey, so I’m remaining optimistic that I’ll be able to recover quickly and still have the opportunity to compete,” Meyers Taylor wrote. She is the only woman to win three Olympic bobsled medals for the U.S., with two silvers and a bronze already in her collection. If she is cleared, she still would be considered a medal contender in both events; monobob, with just a driver in the sled, is part of the Olympic program for the first time. USABS said last week that it was dealing with a number of positive tests among its Olympic delegation, though did not disclose names because of privacy regulations. Josh Williamson, a push athlete who was picked for his first Olympic team, revealed last week that he tested positive at a team camp in Chula Vista, California. Also Tuesday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled against U.S. women’s skeleton athlete Megan Henry, denying her request to be added to the field for the Beijing Games. The U.S. earned two spots in the Olympic field, and they went to five-time Olympian Katie Uhlaender and first-time qualifier Kelly Curtis. The spots were not decided until the final race of the World Cup season and Curtis wound up edging Henry by a slim margin. When some nations who were awarded Olympic spots declined to fill them, the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation reallocates those positions. That seemed to open a door for Henry, who appealed for it but was denied by CAS. The decision means Katie Tannenbaum of the U.S. Virgin Islands will remain in the field after she was awarded the spot that Henry later sought."
8,"Olympic Athletes, Coaches Testing Positive For COVID At Much Higher Rate",coronavirus," BEIJING (AP) — Athletes and team officials are testing positive for COVID-19 at much higher rates than other people arriving in China for the Beijing Olympics, organizers said Tuesday. Figures released by local organizers showed 16 of 379 athletes and officials who arrived Monday tested positive for COVID-19. They have been taken into isolation hotels to limit the spread of the infection and could miss their events. The positive test rate of 4.2% for athletes and officials compared to 0.66% for Olympic “stakeholders,” a group which includes workers and media. Only seven of 1,059 people in that category arriving at Beijing were positive in similar tests Monday. The rates were confirmed in PCR and other follow-up tests for tens of thousands of people at the Beijing Olympics who will live, work and train in closed-off communities separated from the general public. The Chinese government is pursuing a zero-tolerance public health strategy. On Monday, the rate of infection from tests of those already inside the Olympic bubbles was 100 times higher for athletes and officials compared to workers. Five of 3,103 tests from the athletes-officials group were positive compared to only one of more than 60,000 daily tests from “stakeholders.” A total of 200 positive tests for COVID-19 have now been recorded at the Olympics since Jan. 23. Of those 200, 67 were athletes and officials. “Stakeholders” accounted for the other 133. Among the athletes testing positive in Beijing is Hong Kong skier Audrey King, who arrived from a training camp in Bosnia-Herzegovina. King told the South China Morning Post she had no symptoms and was optimistic of skiing in the women’s slalom on Feb. 9. The most senior athlete representative at the International Olympic Committee, two-time Olympic hockey medalist Emma Terho, also is in an isolation hotel after testing positive on arrival. “Even though this is not the start I envisaged, I was happy to see the protocols that Beijing 2022 has put in place are working well,” Terho, an IOC member from Finland who sits on the Olympic body’s executive board, wrote on her Instagram account."
9,Lawsuit Accuses COVID-19 Testing Company Of Faking Results,coronavirus," OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson has filed a lawsuit against an Illinois-based COVID-19 testing company, accusing it of improperly handling tests and providing fake results. The lawsuit announced Monday and filed in King County Superior Court said the Center for COVID Control “failed to deliver prompt, valid and accurate results,” made deceptive promises of results within 48 hours, and reportedly instructed its employees to “lie to patients on a daily basis,” The Seattle Times reported. It describes how the company expanded to about 300 locations throughout the United States and collected tens of thousands of tests a day. “Center for COVID Control contributed to the spread of COVID-19 when it provided false negative results,” Ferguson said in a statement. “These sham testing centers threatened the health and safety of our communities. They must be held accountable.” The lawsuit also said the Center for COVID Control stored tests in garbage bags — rather than properly refrigerating them — backdated sample-collection dates so stale samples would still be processed and instructed its employees to lie when Washington residents asked about delayed results. The Center for COVID Control did not respond to a request for comment Monday from the newspaper or from The Associated Press. All of its locations are closed “until further notice,” according to its website. The company said in a news release on the website that it was using “this operational pause to train additional staff.” The Center for COVID Control sites had been operating in Washington state since October and was increasingly popular particularly after the rapid spread of the omicron variant prompted a rise in demand for tests. Locations in Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, Lakewood, University Place, Auburn, Lynnwood, Everett, Port Orchard and Yakima in Washington promised free test results within 15 minutes for a rapid test and within 48 hours for a more sensitive PCR test. But recently, customers throughout the country have been complaining about the center’s delayed or lack of results, leading health authorities in several states, including California and Illinois, to launch investigations. City officials in In Lakewood, Washington, issued a stop-work order at their local site in mid-January after receiving complaints about the company and finding it was operating without a business license, “among other concerns,” the city said. The company didn’t have a license to operate a business in any Washington cities except Yakima, according to the attorney general’s office. Ferguson’s office plans to file a motion for preliminary injunction “soon to immediately stop the Center for COVID Control’s unlawful conduct,” his statement said. The lawsuit asks the court to order the Center for COVID Control to pay civil penalties of up to $12,500 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act and relinquish any profits the company made from its “unlawful conduct,” in addition to permanently closing all locations, the statement said."

1,Joe Rogan Shares Incorrect Coronavirus Story Just 24 Hours After Apology,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost About 24 hours after apologizing and promising to “have all the pertinent facts at hand” when discussing the coronavirus pandemic, Spotify podcaster Joe Rogan tweeted and then deleted an incorrect story about the drug ivermectin. The medication has become a cause in right-wing media circles and Rogan ― one of its biggest backers ― tweeted: “Well lookie here” along with a story claiming the drug was effective against omicron in a phase III clinical trial. That turned out to be incorrect and the story was updated. Although Rogan deleted his tweet, he did not issue any kind of correction or followup statement. However, his tweet was preserved online by several people, including CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale: Rogan’s tweet came hours - like more than 10 hours - after Reuters corrected its story to make clear this company did *not* say ivermectin had been found effective against omicron in a clinical trial. Good thread here (https://t.co/LCjqR74q1m) on what the company did say. pic.twitter.com/NBACtsvryp Ivermectin is approved for use for parasites and other conditions in humans and animals. While there is no clinical trial evidence that it is effective against coronavirus, research is currently under way. Rogan, who reportedly received $100 million from Spotify for the rights to his podcast, has talked up ivermectin on his show and even took it himself ― along with multiple other treatments ― when he got sick with COVID-19. Rogan and Spotify have come under fire recently for spreading misinformation about the virus and the vaccine. Last week, rock legend Neil Young pulled his music from the company because of Rogan’s popular podcast. “They can have Rogan or Young,” Young wrote at the time. “Not both.” Other artists soon followed, most notably iconic singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell. Rogan, who called himself a fan of both musicians, issued an apology of sorts and vowed to provide more balance in his discussion of the pandemic. That vow seems to have lasted about 24 hours.

2,Hospitals Pull Unvaccinated COVID Patients Off Organ Donation Waiting Lists,coronavirus," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Hospitals are yanking people off waiting lists for donated organs if they refuse to obtain COVID-19 vaccinations. According to officials, the hospitals are following standards set by transplant organizations to give available organs to those with the best chances of survival. The American Society of Transplantation recommends that “all transplant candidates and their household members should have completed the full complement of recommended vaccinations,” including vaccines for COVID-19. “I will die free,” North Carolina resident Chad Carswell, 38, told Charlotte’s WSOC-TV last week after losing his chance at a kidney transplant at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. “There is not a situation in this world that I’ll get a vaccine,” he told The Washington Post. “If I’m laying on my deathbed, and they tell me, ‘You have a kidney waiting on you if you get this shot,’ I’ll tell them, ’I’ll see you on the other side.’” Carswell did not reveal why he refused to get the vaccine, other than: “I was born free.” He’s still receiving dialysis three times a week, but that’s only a temporary solution. “I have to have a kidney to prolong my life,” he said. Hospital officials said the policy “follows the current standard of care in the United States, which is to vaccinate all patients on waiting lists or being evaluated for transplant.” Last week, Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston came under fire after denying a heart transplant to D.J. Ferguson, a 31-year-old father who refused to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Ferguson’s dad said that getting the vaccine was “kinda against his [son’s] basic principles,” reported CBS-TV Boston affiliate WBZ. His mom said he’s concerned about side effects, like “blood clots.” “Whatever the risks associated with the shot, they’re lower than for COVID,” Dr. Art Caplan, head of medical ethics at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, told NBC News. “What you want to do is prevent COVID.” Caplan also said that with the scarcity of available hearts, it’s common policy to require all vaccines, including COVID vaccinations, for transplant patients to give them the best chance of survival. After the uproar, the Brigham hospital system issued a statement emphasizing the shortage of donated organs and long waiting lists. “Like many other transplant programs in the United States, the COVID-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation,” the statement added. Check out D.J. Ferguson’s story in the NBC News video clip above. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Moderna Announces Full FDA Approval For Its COVID-19 Vaccine,coronavirus," WASHINGTON (AP) — Moderna announced Monday that U.S. health regulators granted full approval to its COVID-19 vaccine, a shot that’s been given to tens of millions of Americans since its emergency authorization over a year ago. The action by the Food and Drug Administration means the agency has completed the same rigorous, time-consuming review of Moderna’s shot as dozens of other long-established vaccines. The decision was bolstered by real-world evidence from the more than 200 million doses administered in the U.S. since the FDA cleared the shot in December 2020. The FDA granted full approval of Pfizer’s vaccine last August. Public health advocates initially hoped the regulatory distinction would boost public confidence in the shots. But there was no discernable bump in vaccinations after the Pfizer approval, which was heavily promoted by President Joe Biden and other federal officials. More than 211 million Americans, or 63% of the total population, are fully vaccinated. About 86 million people have gotten a booster dose. Vaccinations peaked last spring at more than 3 million per day, and now average less than 750,000 per day. The pace of vaccinations briefly spiked following news of the omicron variant in December but has since slowed again. The FDA, like regulators in Europe and elsewhere, initially allowed emergency use of Moderna’s vaccine based on a study that tracked 44,000 people 18 and older for at least two months — the time period when serious side effects typically arise. That’s shorter than the six months of safety data normally required for full approval, so Moderna continued that study. The FDA also kept watch for serious side effects that have proved to be very rare. In the U.S., Moderna is used only by adults. The company said last fall that FDA had delayed deciding whether to clear the shots for 12- to 17-year-olds as it examined a rare risk of heart inflammation seen mostly in young men and teen boys. Johnson & Johnson has not yet applied for full approval of its COVID-19 vaccine. ___ AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

4,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Tests Positive For COVID-19,coronavirus," TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday he has tested positive for COVID-19, but is “feeling fine” and will continue working remotely. The announcement came in a tweet in which he urged everyone to “please get vaccinated and get boosted.” Trudeau said on Thursday that he was going into isolation for five days after finding out the previous evening he had been in contact with someone who tested positive. He told The Canadian Press on Friday that person was one of his three children. Trudeau previously isolated at home in the early months of the pandemic after his wife tested positive. Canada has one of the world’s highest rates of vaccination against the coronavirus — shots which are primarily designed to keep those who become infected from falling seriously ill. The announcement followed a weekend of protests in Canada’s capital, Ottawa, against vaccine mandates, masks and lockdowns. Some demonstrators travelled in truck convoys and parked on the streets around Parliament Hill, blocking traffic."
5,GOP Congressman Quotes Infamous Neo-Nazi In Attempt To Slam Dr. Fauci,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) posted a quote from a neo-Nazi on Twitter on Sunday and incorrectly attributed it to Voltaire in an effort to attack National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Massie tweeted: You mustn’t question Fauci, for he is science. pic.twitter.com/KnqCcPXWSe It’s not clear if Massie knew the true origin of the quote when he posted it. However, it was quickly pointed out on social media that the quote was not, as the image suggested, from Voltaire but rather from Kevin Alfred Strom, a notorious neo-Nazi who was convicted on child porn charges in 2008. USA Today fact-checked the quote after it went viral last spring. Strom called it “kind of flattering.” Others have also mistakenly shared the quote, including actor and progressive activist John Cusack, who apologized for doing so in 2019. As of early Monday, Massie’s message remained on the site. A growing number of Republican lawmakers have openly embraced white supremacist and/or anti-Semitic viewpoints, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.),who has repeatedly been linked to white nationalists, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has spouted racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as violent rhetoric. Both have been stripped of their committee assignments as a result. Last November, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said they would get their assignments back if Republicans retook the House in the 2022 midterm elections. He also vowed to kick several Democrats out of their committees in retaliation. Overnight Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"‘Neil Young Fan’ Joe Rogan Apologizes, Vows Changes As Pressure On Spotify Grows",coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Podcaster Joe Rogan apologized on Sunday to anyone who is offended by his frequent broadcast of misinformation about the coronavirus and the vaccine as pressure increases against Spotify, which hosts his show. “If I pissed you off, I’m sorry,” Rogan said on Instagram. “And if you enjoy the podcast, thank you.” However, Rogan also took issue with the term “misinformation” and defended his “highly credentialed, very intelligent, very accomplished” guests. “They have an opinion that is different from the mainstream narrative,” he said. “I wanted to hear what their opinion is.” Rogan’s comments came days after rock icon Neil Young pulled his music from Spotify because of Rogan’s podcast. “They can have Rogan or Young,” Young wrote. “Not both.” Fellow music legend Joni Mitchell followed suit, saying: “I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.” Rogan said he doesn’t hold it against either of them. “I’m very sorry that they feel that way,” he said. “I most certainly don’t want that. I’m a Neil Young fan. I’ve always been a Neil Young fan.” At various points in his nearly 10-minute statement, Rogan admitted that he doesn’t always do a lot of prep work for his show but promised to do more research “and have all the pertinent facts at hand before I discuss them.” Rogan also pledged to “balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people’s perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view.” On Sunday, Spotify released a statement saying it would add a content advisory to podcasts that discuss the coronavirus and direct listeners to its “COVID-19 hub” for more information. Rogan said he supported that. Spotify also said it has rules against content that “promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information.” Given some of Rogan’s episodes, those rules do not seem to have been enforced with much vigor. In addition to featuring guests who’ve spread misleading information about the pandemic, Rogan has come under fire for some of his own comments. Last year, for example, he falsely suggested that young, healthy people don’t need to be vaccinated against COVID-19. He later walked it back, calling himself a “fucking moron” and “not a respected source of information.” As Young and Mitchell exited Spotify, their fans followed suit. While it’s not clear how many canceled, #ByeSpotify trended on Twitter several times, including on Sunday evening, after the company’s announcement and Rogan’s apology. Spotify is paying Rogan a reported $100 million to be the exclusive home of his podcast, which he claims has 200 million monthly listeners.

7,Omicron Amps Up Concerns About Long COVID: 'I Want My Life Back',coronavirus," More than a year after a bout with COVID-19, Rebekah Hogan still suffers from severe brain fog, pain and fatigue that leave her unable to do her nursing job or handle household activities. Long COVID has her questioning her worth as a wife and mother. “Is this permanent? Is this the new norm?’’ said the 41-year-old Latham, New York, woman, whose three children and husband also have signs of the condition. “I want my life back.’’ More than a third of COVID-19 survivors by some estimates will develop such lingering problems. Now, with omicron sweeping across the globe, scientists are racing to pinpoint the cause of the bedeviling condition and find treatments before a potential explosion in long COVID cases. Could it be an autoimmune disorder? That could help explain why long COVID-19 disproportionately affects women, who are more likely than men to develop autoimmune diseases. Could microclots be the cause of symptoms ranging from memory lapses to discolored toes? That could make sense, since abnormal blood clotting can occur in COVID-19. As these theories and others are tested, there is fresh evidence that vaccination may reduce the chances of developing long COVID. It’s too soon to know whether people infected with the highly contagious omicron variant will develop the mysterious constellation of symptoms, usually diagnosed many weeks after the initial illness. But some experts think a wave of long COVID is likely and say doctors need to be prepared for it. With $1 billion from Congress, the National Institutes of Health is funding a vast array of research on the condition. And clinics devoted to studying and treating it are popping up around the world, affiliated with places such as Stanford University in California and University College London. Momentum is building around a few key theories. One is that the infection or remnants of the virus persist past the initial illness, triggering inflammation that leads to long COVID. Another is that latent viruses in the body, such as the Epstein-Barr virus that causes mononucleosis, are reactivated. A recent study in the journal Cell pointed to Epstein-Barr in the blood as one of four possible risk factors, which also include pre-existing Type 2 diabetes and the levels of coronavirus RNA and certain antibodies in the blood. Those findings must be confirmed with more research. A third theory is that autoimmune responses develop after acute COVID-19. In a normal immune response, viral infections activate antibodies that fight invading virus proteins. But sometimes in the aftermath, antibodies remain revved up and mistakenly attack normal cells. That phenomenon is thought to play a role in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. Justyna Fert-Bober and Dr. Susan Cheng were among researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who found that some people who have had COVID-19, including cases without symptoms, have a variety of these elevated “autoantibodies” up to six months after recovering. Some are the same ones found in people with autoimmune diseases. Another possibility is that tiny clots play a role in long COVID. Many COVID-19 patients develop elevated levels of inflammatory molecules that promote abnormal clotting. That can lead to blood clots throughout the body that can cause strokes, heart attacks and dangerous blockages in the legs and arms. In her lab at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, scientist Resia Pretorius has found microclots in blood samples from patients with COVID-19 and in those who later developed long COVID. She also found elevated levels of proteins in blood plasma that prevented the normal breakdown of these clots. She believes that these clotting abnormalities persist in many patients after an initial coronavirus infection and that they reduce oxygen distribution to cells and tissue throughout the body, leading to most if not all symptoms that have been linked to long COVID. While there’s no firm list of symptoms that define the condition, the most common include fatigue, problems with memory and thinking, loss of taste and smell, shortness of breath, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Some of these symptoms may first appear during an initial infection but linger or recur a month or more later. Or new ones may develop, lasting for weeks, months or over a year. Because so many of the symptoms occur with other illnesses, some scientists question whether the coronavirus is always the trigger. Researchers hope their work will provide definitive answers. Long COVID affects adults of all ages as well as children. Research shows it is more prevalent among those who were hospitalized, but also strikes a significant portion who weren’t. Retired flight attendant Jacki Graham’s bout with COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic wasn’t bad enough to put her in the hospital. But months later, she experienced breathlessness and a racing heart. She couldn’t taste or smell. Her blood pressure shot up. In the fall of 2020, she became so fatigued that her morning yoga would send her back to bed. “I’m an early riser, so I’d get up and push myself, but then I was done for the day,” said Graham, 64, of Studio City, California. “Six months ago, I would have told you COVID has ruined my life.” Hogan, the New York nurse, also wasn’t hospitalized with COVID-19 but has been debilitated since her diagnosis. Her husband, a disabled veteran, and children ages 9, 13 and 15 fell ill soon after and were sick with fever, stomach pains and weakness for about a month. Then all seemed to get a little better until new symptoms appeared. Hogan’s doctors think autoimmune abnormalities and a pre-existing connective tissue disorder that causes joint pain may have made her prone to developing the condition. There are no treatments specifically approved for long COVID, though some patients get relief from painkillers, drugs used for other conditions, and physical therapy. But more help may be on the horizon. Immunobiologist Akiko Iwasaki is studying the tantalizing possibility that COVID-19 vaccination might reduce long COVID symptoms. Her team at Yale University is collaborating with a patient group called Survivor Corps on a study that involves vaccinating previously unvaccinated long COVID patients as a possible treatment. Iwasaki, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which supports The Associated Press’ Health and Science Department, said she is doing this study because patient groups have reported improvement in some people’s long COVID symptoms after they got their shots. Study participant Nancy Rose, 67, of Port Jefferson, New York, said many of her symptoms waned after she got vaccinated, though she still has bouts of fatigue and memory loss. Two recently released studies, one from the U.S. and one from Israel, offer preliminary evidence that being vaccinated before getting COVID-19 could help prevent the lingering illness or at least reduce its severity. Both were done before omicron emerged. Neither has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but outside experts say the results are encouraging. In the Israeli study, about two-thirds of participants received one or two Pfizer shots; the others were unvaccinated. Those who had received two shots were at least half as likely to report fatigue, headache, muscle weakness or pain and other common long COVID symptoms as the unvaccinated group. With few clear answers yet, the future is murky for patients. Many, like Graham, see improvement over time. She sought help through a long COVID program at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled in a study there in April 2021, and was vaccinated and boosted. Today, she said, her blood pressure is normal, and her sense of smell and energy level are getting closer to pre-COVID levels. Still, she wound up retiring early because of her ordeal. Hogan still struggles with symptoms that include agonizing nerve pain and “spaghetti legs,’’ or limbs that suddenly become limp and unable to bear weight, a condition that also affects her 13-year-old son. Some scientists worry that long COVID in certain patients might become a form of chronic fatigue syndrome, a poorly understood, long-lasting condition that has no cure or approved treatment. One thing’s for sure, some experts say: Long COVID will have a huge effect on individuals, health care systems and economies around the world, costing many billions of dollars. Even with insurance, patients can be out thousands of dollars at a time when they’re too sick to work. Graham, for example, said she paid about $6,000 out of pocket for things like scans, labs, doctor visits and chiropractic care. Pretorius, the scientist in South Africa, said there is real worry things could get worse. “So many people are losing their livelihoods, their homes. They can’t work anymore,” she said. “Long COVID will probably have a more severe impact on our economy than acute COVID.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

8,Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Urge Spotify To Address 'Serious Harms' Of COVID Lies,coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have expressed their shared concerns to Spotify over its role in giving COVID-19 misinformation a platform. Lending their voices to a growing number of public figures who have spoken out against the streaming giant amid a dispute about Joe Rogan’s controversial podcast, the couple addressed the “serious harms” of spreading false claims surrounding vaccines in a statement on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who signed an exclusive, multiyear podcasting partnership with Spotify in 2020, said they previously raised the issue about the “all-too-real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation” with the company last April. “Since the inception of Archewell, we have worked to address the real-time global misinformation crisis. Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day,” a spokesperson for the couple’s Archewell Foundation said, per HuffPost. “Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all-too-real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform.” “We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis,” the statement concluded. “We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.” The statement did not mention Rogan or his massively popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which is exclusively carried by Spotify, but others haven’t shied away from directly addressing the host’s lies. Last week, musician Neil Young pulled his entire catalog from the streaming service, citing the company’s distribution partnership with Rogan, who he said was disseminating “false information about vaccines — potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them.” Days later, Joni Mitchell followed suit in solidarity with Young and the “global scientific and medical communities on this issue.” In response to the controversy, Spotify said on Wednesday that the company had the “great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators” and had “removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic.” But many believe the streaming service hasn’t been aggressive enough in its fight against misinformation. The host and comedian actively discouraged young people from getting the vaccine only to backpedal days later, admitting he was a “fucking moron” and “not a respected source of information, even for me.” He also promoted the use of ivermectin as a way to treat COVID-19 and suggested President Joe Biden faked getting a booster shot on live TV. Earlier this month, a coalition of 270 doctors, scientists, professors and medical professionals signed an open letter blasting Rogan’s podcast for “promoting baseless conspiracy theories” and “allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions.” “With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE is the world’s largest podcast and has tremendous influence,” the letter read. “Though Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, the company presently has no misinformation policy.” First announced in December 2020, Spotify’s partnership with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was formed to “host and produce podcasts that build community through shared experience, narratives, and values,” according to a press release at the time. But the deal has yet to bear much fruit. Apart from a 33-minute 2020 holiday special, which included a surprise appearance from their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the couple hasn’t released any content on the platform.

9,How To Manage Fear Around COVID While Still Staying Safe,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost Since the start of the pandemic, the bulk of messaging about COVID has been extremely fear-based. We’ve read scary headline after scary headline as we have kept tabs on record-high case counts, death rates and hospitalization rates. We have consumed stories of people’s life-threatening battles with COVID and long COVID. As a result, many of us have become exceedingly fearful about navigating life in the pandemic. And for a valid reason: This has been a scary 22 months. The coronavirus is new and ubiquitous, and, for a long time, we didn’t have ways to effectively mitigate the risk, said Dr. Lucy McBride, a practicing internal medicine physician in Washington, D.C. There absolutely has been a reason to be afraid — to a degree. Fear has a very important role in our lives: It keeps us safe by teaching our brains to avoid dangers and threats. In a way, it also helps people understand the risks associated with COVID so they can make informed decisions about what is and isn’t safe. But hitting people with too much fear can backfire. Excessive fear can reduce our tolerance for risk, it can make us hyperalert and hypervigilant, and it can cause us to make decisions that don’t optimally serve our mental and physical health. The key is finding the delicate equilibrium. Our brains are devoted to learning about the world, said Dr. Greg Siegle, a professor of psychiatry, psychology and translational sciences at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. If we are rewarded for a good thing, our brains continue to seek out the good thing. If we are punished for a bad thing, our brains become fearful of the bad thing so that we learn to avoid it. “Fear is very good at creating avoidance,” Siegle said. “If you want somebody to avoid something, you make them afraid of it.” Of course, for many people — especially certain immunocompromised individuals — it makes sense to be fearful of COVID. The risk isn’t zero, and it probably never will be. Vaccines have significantly improved outcomes in immunocompromised individuals who get COVID, but those with weakened immune systems are experiencing higher rates of breakthrough infections, and some of those can turn severe. Their vulnerability greatly depends on what local transmission is like, and whether the people around them are vaccinated ― two things that are largely out of their control. But when we become absorbed by fear, our brains prioritize that fear and we start constantly scanning for threats with wide eyes. When this happens, we stop processing other important healthy behaviors that might seem more optional — things like digesting food, sleeping and connecting with loved ones. “Particularly, at this moment, with a ubiquitous virus that is highly transmissible, fear isn’t shielding us from coronavirus,” McBride said. “It’s actually, for many people, limiting their ability to meet their broader human needs.” When our fear systems are chronically over-activated, our physical and mental health can deteriorate. That’s why it’s important to walk the right line when it comes to fear, particularly fear-based thoughts that are within our control. Previous research has found that when people are overwhelmed with fear, they become anxious and engage in more destructive behaviors like smoking, drinking and unhealthy eating. Being overwhelmed with fear can even demotivate us to seek out the rewarding things in life, according to Siegle. Plus, when it comes to public health messaging, too much fear erodes trust in public heath. It’s crucial to be intentional and nuanced when communicating the risks associated with COVID so that people don’t dismiss what’s going on or become overly afraid. (It’s worth noting that how much fear we can tolerate is also very individual and cultural. Some people, and cultures, can handle and comfortably live with more fear and arousal than others.) “Fear is natural and important — but maybe it shouldn’t take us over and be the primary ruling thing in our lives,” Siegle said. “Fear is very good at creating avoidance. If you want somebody to avoid something, you make them afraid of it.” If you want to develop a more rational and less fear-based approach, Siegle said you’ll want to look at your risk assessment in a nuanced, evidence-based way. Be intentional about where you get your news and information: Avoid sensationalist headlines, look for the facts, and try not to solely read articles that reinforce your fear. Siegle also recommended using the microCOVID risk calculator, which helps people estimate their personal risk for various activities in a specific, nuanced way. You punch in your location, vaccination status, and the activity you’re interested in doing ― including with whom and for how long. Then, you determine how much risk you’re willing to assume (some, none or a lot) and the calculator provides you with an idea of what living with that risk level looks like. Similarly, McBride’s biggest piece of advice was to find a trusted doctor who can translate all of the information about COVID and apply it to your unique situation. Ultimately, you want to find meaningful activities you can engage in, with modifications when necessary, that can bring you comfort, joy and solace, said Nathaniel Ivers, an associate professor in the department of counseling at Wake Forest University who specializes in terror management theory. It’s important to stay connected to others, Ivers said, and COVID has created so much isolation that has left us alone with our thoughts. “Try not to sit in the thoughts and the emotions by yourself ― really try to bounce them off of other people because, in so doing, you’ll receive feedback on how reasonable and rational those ideas are,” he said. Mindfulness can also be extremely helpful in bringing us back to the present moment. When we are fearful, we’re oftentimes future-oriented and thinking about all the things that could happen. “Mindfulness requires us to be present-focused, non-reactive and non-judgmental about the things that are happening around us and within us,” Ivers said. It helps us focus on what’s actually happening, rather than worrying about what could. Finally, if your fear has led to debilitating depression and anxiety, ask for help and find a good therapist or psychiatrist. Living with fear — especially in the time of COVID — is natural and normal, but there are helpful therapies and medications available if fear has become overwhelming and is negatively interfering with the quality of your life. “Fear is human, and fear is important,” Siegle said. “We can respect it and we live with it, but we don’t have to be ruled by it only.” On Assignment For HuffPost"

0,Ex-GOP Rep. Suggests Dangerous 'Wedge Issue' Between Trump And DeSantis,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) suggested Friday that COVID-19 vaccines will become a worrying “wedge issue” between former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) during their rumored respective runs for the White House in 2024. “Is this a wedge issue now that Ron DeSantis wants between him and MAGA nation and between him and the former president?” Jolly asked MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace during a discussion about DeSantis’ nominee for Florida surgeon general, anti-mask, anti-lockdown and vaccine skeptic Dr. Joseph Ladapo. Ladapo’s nomination is indicative of the “pandemic of lunacy that is infecting” today’s GOP, said Jolly, who left the party in 2018. “You simply have to deny the reality of COVID, you have to deny science, you have to deny the competence of our leading public health officials for political purposes,” he said. “Does the Florida governor agree that Trump’s Operation Warp Speed was successful or not?” he asked. “Welcome to the big leagues, Ron DeSantis. Tell us.” Watch the interview here: ""Politically... something very interesting here is the emerging wedge issue on the vaccine between Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump. Does the Florida governor agree that Trump's Operation Warp Speed was successful or not?"" - @DavidJollyFL w/ @NicolleDWallace pic.twitter.com/N0l0f4d7sG Jolly last week warned that DeSantis would be “far more dangerous” as president than Trump. “He’s more savvy. He’s more coy. And he doesn’t have the pitfalls that Donald Trump does,” he cautioned. “He’s really kneecapping democracy right now for people of Florida, and he will successfully do it on the national stage should he get to the White House.” Trump endorsed DeSantis in 2018 but their relationship has reportedly soured over their potential rival runs.

1,5 Meaningful Ways To Help People Living With Long COVID,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost There are days Meg St-Esprit can’t work. Days she can’t carpool her kids to their school and sports. And days when she thinks it might not get better. St-Esprit, a mom of four children in Pittsburgh, is one of the millions of long COVID sufferers in the U.S. (Estimates of long COVID are hard to pin down. Some data estimates that 57% of people with COVID-19 will develop long-haul COVID. Other estimates range from 15% to 80%.) For her, the virus wasn’t a two-week hiccup, but rather a 14-month ordeal ― and counting ― as she battles ongoing effects such as anemia, brain fog, exhaustion and other debilitating symptoms. The condition goes by many names, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as researchers and experts work to define it and treat it ― essentially building the plane while they fly it. Post-COVID. Long COVID. Long-haul COVID. Post-Acute COVID-19. Long-term effects of COVID. Chronic COVID. Whatever you call it, it’s making pandemic life all the more difficult for many Americans. As of July 2021, the condition was classified as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. “The thing that’s really hard though is nobody knows how to support someone with long COVID,” St-Esprit said. Like many disabilities, long COVID is an invisible illness. The symptoms also vary from person to person. If someone you love has long COVID, here are ways you can support them, according to experts: There is an extensive list of symptoms patients might experience with long COVID. They can include: Plus other health conditions that may pop up, like heart problems and blood clotting. Long COVID is so far beyond a lingering sickness. St-Esprit’s children’s school has had to remind her many times about forms, library books, and other tasks parents typically take care of. It isn’t that she forgot, it’s that she never even remembers having these conversations, putting them in her calendar or getting reminder emails because of her brain fog. “There have definitely been times where I feel people are frustrated with me,” she said. Some of the phrasing she’s encountered, such as an email starting with “per my last email four weeks ago,” feels horrible as she struggles with recovery, she said. Sometimes she feels like her “brain is on fire” and she can’t remember a word, which has caused her kids to be frustrated, she added. She highly values friends who accommodate for this and help remind her of various events, like an upcoming school book fair. Dr. J. Tod Olin, a pulmonologist and director of the Exercise Breathing Center at National Jewish Health in Colorado, encourages people to be patient with those living with long COVID. “Like a lot of things in life, the most important thing is to realize that it is challenging to understand the experience and perspective of another person,” Olin said. This might mean giving people an easy out if they aren’t up for something they’d planned to do that day, St-Esprit said. She recommended starting with phrases like “hey if you are able to handle this today ― and if not it’s OK.” This acknowledges and communicates your patience and flexibility. “Like a lot of things in life, the most important thing is to realize that it is challenging to understand the experience and perspective of another person.” It can be terrifying to be diagnosed with a brand new condition that has only has a few months of research ― not decades. “A little hope never hurts,” Olin said. This can be as simple as reminding your loved one that scientists and doctors are working hard to come up with treatments for the condition that has “an unsatisfyingly low number of perfect answers right now.” “While the pace of research discovery is always slow for the person experiencing problems now, it is OK to point out that the medical community is an ally, understanding of the problem, and trying to come up with innovative solutions quickly,” Olin said. You can also ease the burden of navigating the medical system by offering to take notes at health care provider appointments, calling to make new appointments, and organizing health insurance logistics and questions — all tasks that can seem overwhelming. Dr. Nate Bergman, a certified practitioner at the Institute for Functional Medicine and who works with the Cleveland Neurofeedback Center in Ohio, added that helping long COVID patients focus on the aspects of life they can control ― from healthy eating to getting enough sleep ― can help them refocus on a hopeful future. “The fatigue just has really not gone away,” St-Esprit said. “Some days I have spoons, some days I don’t” is a phrase that helps her realize that some days she will have energy and some days she just won’t. (The phrase comes from a viral story by Christine Miserandino on chronic illness, which used spoons as a unit of measurement for energy.) Helpful gestures such as doing basic chores, bringing groceries and offering to babysit can relieve a person’s fatigue a bit by giving them a chance to nap or rest. St-Esprit added that one of the most helpful ways a friend has supported her is by asking very specific questions as to how they can help, instead of saying “let me know if you need anything.” She’ll text, “Hey, I’m going into Aldi, do you need anything?” Olin reassures people they don’t have to overthink it: “Just cook dinner and drive the carpool for them,” Olin said. The last thing a person with long COVID needs is to hear about is how your own COVID experience just felt like a cold. This has happened many times to St-Esprit, and it’s the opposite of validating and empathizing with what they are going through. Bergman has seen the devastating effects on patients who he said come in feeling completely deflated. “It’s just amazing how much a loss of smell and taste can destabilize someone cognitively,” he said. He hopes the health care community, as well as family and friends, can be sensitive to the level of disruption people are experiencing. Finally, when you aren’t sure what to say, as with any struggle, simply showing up and listening can be validating enough. On Assignment For HuffPost"
2,COVID Hits One Of The Last Uninfected Places On The Planet,coronavirus," WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — When the coronavirus began spreading around the world, the remote Pacific archipelago of Kiribati closed its borders, ensuring the disease didn’t reach its shores for nearly two full years. Kiribati finally began reopening this month, allowing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to charter a plane to bring home 54 of the island nation’s citizens. Many of those aboard were missionaries who had left Kiribati before the border closure to spread the faith abroad for what is commonly known as the Mormon church. Officials tested each returning passenger three times in nearby Fiji, required that they be vaccinated, and put them in quarantine with additional testing when they arrived home. It wasn’t enough. More than half the passengers tested positive for the virus, which has now slipped out into the community and prompted the government to declare a state of disaster. An initial 36 positive cases from the flight had ballooned to 181 cases by Friday. Kiribati and several other small Pacific nations were among the last places on the planet to have avoided any virus outbreaks, thanks to their remote locations and strict border controls. But their defenses appear no match against the highly contagious omicron variant. “Generally speaking, it’s inevitable. It will get to every corner of the world,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “It’s a matter of buying enough time to prepare and getting as many people vaccinated as possible.” Only 33% of Kiribati’s 113,000 people are fully vaccinated, while 59% have had at least one dose, according to the online scientific publication Our World in Data. And like many other Pacific nations, Kiribati offers only basic health services. Dr. Api Talemaitoga, who chairs a network of Indigenous Pacific Island doctors in New Zealand, said Kiribati had only a couple of intensive care beds in the entire nation, and in the past relied on sending its sickest patients to Fiji or New Zealand for treatment. He said that given the limitations of Kiribati’s health system, his first reaction when he heard about the outbreak was, “Oh, my lord.” Kiribati has now opened multiple quarantine sites, declared a curfew and imposed lockdowns. President Taneti Maamau said on social media that the government is using all its resources to manage the situation, and urged people to get vaccinated. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in the U.S. state of Utah, has a strong presence in many Pacific nations, including Kiribati, where its 20,000 members make it the third-largest Christian denomination. The church has about 53,000 missionaries serving full time around the world, working to convert people. The pandemic has presented challenges for their missionary work, which is considered a rite of passage for men as young as 18 and women as young as 19. As the pandemic ebbed and flowed, the church responded. It recalled about 26,000 missionaries who were serving overseas  in June 2020, reassigning them to proselytize online from home before sending some back out into the field five months later. When COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in many countries in April 2021, church officials encouraged all missionaries to get inoculated and required it of those serving outside their home countries. Church spokesperson Sam Penrod said the returning missionaries remained in quarantine, were cooperating with local health authorities and would be released from their service upon completion of their quarantine. “With Kiribati’s borders being closed since the onset of the pandemic, many of these individuals have continued as missionaries well beyond their 18 to 24 months of anticipated service, with some serving as long as 44 months,” he said. Before this month’s outbreak, Kiribati had reported just two virus cases: crew members on an incoming cargo ship that ultimately wasn’t permitted to dock. But the Kiribati charter flight wasn’t the first time missionaries returning home to a Pacific island nation tested positive for COVID-19. In October, a missionary returning to Tonga from service in Africa was reported as the country’s first  — and so far only — positive case after flying home via New Zealand. Like those returning to Kiribati, he also was vaccinated and quarantined. Tonga is desperately trying to prevent any outbreaks as it recovers from a devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami earlier this month. The nation of 105,000 has been receiving aid from around the world but has requested that crews from incoming military ships and planes drop their supplies and leave without having any contact with those on the ground. “They’ve got enough on their hands without compounding it with the spread of COVID,” said Petousis-Harris, the vaccine expert. “Anything they can do to keep it out is going to be important. COVID would be just compounding that disaster.” In the long term, however, it is going to be impossible to stop the virus from entering Tonga or any other community, Petousis-Harris said. Nearby Samoa, with a population of 205,000, is also trying to prevent its first outbreak. It imposed a lockdown through until Friday evening after 15 passengers on an incoming flight from Australia last week tested positive. By Thursday, that number had grown to 27, including five front-line nurses who had treated the passengers. Officials said all those infected had been isolated and there was no community outbreak so far. While the incursion of the virus into the Pacific has prompted lockdowns and other restrictions, there were signs that not all traditional aspects of island life would be lost for long. “Government has decided to allow fishing,” Kiribati declared on Thursday, while listing certain restrictions on times and places. “Only four people will be allowed to be on a boat or part of a group fishing near shore.” ___ Metz reported from Salt Lake City."
3,Sen. Ron Johnson's Latest COVID Conspiracy: Athletes 'Dropping Dead' From Vaccines,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has found a new conspiracy theory to peddle about the effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines: that somehow, uncovered by the media, and silenced by government health officials, hordes of athletes are dropping dead on the field after getting the jab. First things first: They’re not. Johnson, the U.S. Senate’s resident COVID-19 truther, went on right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk’s show this week to repeat some of his most dangerous talking points about the vaccines — namely his concern about deaths related to receiving a shot. Johnson falsely told Kirk that there have been 22,000 deaths related to the vaccine — a number that appears to come from an inaccurate and misleading report from anti-vaccine advocates that draws from an official public government database where anyone can report adverse health effects from vaccines. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) falsely tells Charlie Kirk that there have been 22,000 deaths associated with coronavirus vaccines and that ""all these athletes are dropping dead on the field."" (???) pic.twitter.com/6RK6ho6y36 Then Johnson repeated a persistent conspiracy theory from anti-vaccine activists that professional athletes are literally dropping dead on the field because of the COVID-19 vaccine. “The Faucis of the world are just blowing it all off, the Biden administration [says] nothing to see here,” Johnson said. “Of course we’ve heard story after story, I mean, all these athletes dropping dead on the field. But we are supposed to ignore that.” This claim, which has been spread online through misleading videos, has been repeatedly debunked. “Previous lists of athletes who purportedly died from the COVID-19 vaccines have included people who hadn’t died or hadn’t gotten the vaccine,” according to Politifact, which fact-checked the claim again this week after NBA All-Star John Stockton repeated it in an interview with his hometown newspaper. “There have been no official reports linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded.” COVID-19 conspiracies are familiar territory for Johnson, who is running for reelection in Wisconsin this year. He started his week in Washington, D.C., hosting a panel of fringe medical professionals and experts who downplayed the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing, and embraced untested and unproven home remedies like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. (The impacts of ivermectin on COVID-19 are still under going clinical trial.) Johnson, who himself has refused to get vaccinated, has repeatedly put life-saving public health messaging at risk, questioning why Americans need to get vaccinated en masse. While much of the country has gotten vaccinated against COVID-19, the United States is still struggling with vaccine hesitancy in some areas. Between October and November of last year, the CDC found an unvaccinated person had 14 times the risk of infection compared to a fully vaccinated person who had received a booster dose. Unvaccinated people had 53.2 times the risk of COVID-associated death. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Evangeline Lilly Says She Went To Anti-Vaxxer Rally Because She's 'Pro-Choice',coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Evangeline Lilly said she attended an anti-vaccine rally in Washington, D.C., last weekend because she is “pro-choice.” The actor claimed in an Instagram post that she was in Washington “to support bodily sovereignty” and said she believes “nobody should ever be forced to inject their body with anything, against their will” under “any threat whatsoever.” “This is not the way,” she wrote in the caption. “This is not safe. This is not healthy. This is not love. I understand the world is in fear, but I don’t believe that answering fear with force will fix our problems. I was pro choice before COVID and I am still pro choice today.” Her post did not mention some of the more outlandish claims that came out of the rally. Notably, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested that Holocaust victims had it easier than people who didn’t want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. He also claimed that people like Bill Gates are “putting in 5G to harvest our data and control our behavior.” Lilly has come under fire previously for her behavior during the pandemic. In March 2020, she was heavily criticized after she admitted she wasn’t social distancing even though she lived with her dad, who had Stage 4 leukemia. “Some people value their lives over freedom,” she said at the time. “Some people value freedom over their lives.” Lilly later called her remarks about the coronavirus “dismissive, arrogant and cryptic.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
5,10 Face Masks And Accessories That'll Leave Your Makeup In Perfect Condition,coronavirus," Shopping Writer for HuffPost Hot take: I get irritated when my makeup gets smudged from wearing my face mask. As vain as it sounds, I get a little irked when I take off my mask only to see the remnants of that morning’s foundation and tinted lip balm smeared on the inside of my mask, leaving patchy evidence on my face along with it. In the grand scheme of things, I understand that a little displaced lipstick is a small price to pay for protecting myself and others from COVID. However, I also understand that I’m not alone in this minor, privileged irritation. Many people who work in professional settings might be required to take off their mask for virtual calls or other in-person interactions, while others may wear their mask on the way to an event or dinner where at that point, it can be safe to remove your mask. Additionally, marring a mask with makeup might compromise the integrity of the mask, causing more frequent washes and disposals ― another inconvenience all its own. The masks below can be a great way to provide protection without compromising your desire to keep your makeup in place. Find options that are made from fabric that won’t rub or grip at your makeup, or that use structured designs so the mask sits away from your face. Note: Cloth masks can help protect you against COVID, but during the current omicron surge, health officials are recommending N95 and KN95 masks (the Chinese equivalent of the U.S. N95 masks) for more protection. The masks mentioned below may also be suitable to wear over KN95 masks. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

6,Joe Rogan’s Hot Take On The Term ‘Black’ Stuns Trevor Noah,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah on Wednesday mocked podcaster Joe Rogan for his hot take on the term “Black.” Rogan, during a podcast episode this week with controversial professor Jordan Peterson, said that “unless you are talking to someone who is, like, 100% African from the darkest place where they are not wearing any clothes all day and they have developed all of that melanin to protect themselves from the sun, even the term Black is weird.” Noah feigned surprise at Rogan’s comments. “Oh my God! I’m not Black! I’m not Black! Joe Rogan’s right! I’m like a caramel mocha frappuccino. This changes everything, this changes everything,” he sarcastically declared. Noah ran off set. Police sirens blared. Then it cut back to Noah back at his desk. “The police said I’m Black,” the comedian deadpanned. At least the race blather was a change from Rogan’s amplification of coronavirus misinformation, cracked Noah. Noah then broke things down for Rogan, who is white: The things these guys seem to be ignoring is that Black people didn’t call themselves Black. You understand that, right? It’s not like Black people were like, ‘We’re Black.’ No. In Africa, we have tribes, we have cultures. Zulu, Xhosa, Baganda, Igbo, Wakandans! But then white people got there, and they were like, ‘Wow. There’s a lot of Black people here. A lot of Black people.’ Then in America, they invented a rule that if you had one drop of Black blood in you, that makes you Black, which defined how you were treated by the government and by society.

7,Aaron Rodgers: Tons Of People Watched My Playoff Game Because They Hoped I’d Lose,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Aaron Rodgers may be on to something. The Green Bay Packers quarterback opened up on the “The Pat McAfee Show” Tuesday about his team’s season coming to an end over the weekend. The Packers missed out on their chance of playing in Super Bowl LVI when they lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday. According to Packers Wire, almost 37 million people tuned in to the playoffs game, and Rodgers believes a good chunk of those viewers were straight-up haters. ""There were a ton of people tuning in, rooting against us ... because of my vaccination status.”— Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers pic.twitter.com/sgI9wtSZAs “There were a ton of people tuning in, rooting against us, for one reason and one reason only,” Rodgers told McAfee on his radio show. “It’s because of my vaccination status, and them wanting to see us lose so they could pile on and enjoy and revel in the fact that my vaccination status was some sort of reason why we haven’t had success in the playoffs.” Rodgers’ reasoning isn’t a complete fumble. Plenty of people on Twitter appeared to relish in watching the Packers lose over the weekend, and their reasoning didn’t seem to be because they’re diehard 49ers fans. With all that good karma Aaron Rodgers built up this year, surprised to see him knocked out of the playoffs so fast.

How #Twitter is dragging #AaronRogers after another loss #Niners #Packers #49ers pic.twitter.com/oS9DRYJEgx Rodgers has experienced a swift fall from grace in the past year. Initially the 38-year-old football player seemed to be on a roll in the public’s eye. Early in 2021, Rodgers announced his engagement to “Big Little Lies” star Shailene Woodley and had a 10-episode run as a guest host on “Jeopardy!” But his public image quickly shifted when his views on vaccines came to light. After lying to reporters about his vaccination status, he caught COVID-19 in November 2021. Later that month, he went on McAfee’s show to insist he wasn’t an “anti-vax flat-earther,” but unleashed a stream of false information, which also included the daunting admission that he was seeking advice from the controversial comedian Joe Rogan — who also caught COVID-19. In December, when President Joe Biden encountered a woman wearing a Packers jacket during a visit to tornado-ravaged Kentucky, he urged her to tell Rodgers to get the vaccine. Rodgers apparently didn’t appreciate Biden’s comment and decided to blast the president in an ESPN piece published on Friday — the day before the Packers’ playoff game. “When the president of the United States says, ‘This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,’ it’s because him and his constituents, which — I don’t know how there are any if you watch any of his attempts at public speaking — but I guess he got 81 million votes,” the NFL star told ESPN. “But when you say stuff like that, and then you have the CDC, which — how do you even trust them — but then they come out and talk about 75% of the COVID deaths have at least four comorbidities,” he continued. “And you still have this fake White House set saying that this is the pandemic of the unvaccinated. That’s not helping the conversation.” Reporter, HuffPost"
8,The Best Face Masks For People With Beards And Facial Hair,coronavirus," Shopping Writer at HuffPost Getting vaccinated and consistently wearing a well-fitted mask provides the best protection against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But when you have a significant amount of facial hair or a beard that you’re not planning to shave anytime soon, finding a mask that fits for protection and comfort is no easy task. Wearing a too-tight face mask over a beard can causes a dreaded “beard dent.” And while many folks in the bearded community opt for neck gaiters instead, they’re not the most effective face covering to use. Neck gaiters, which at one point earlier in the pandemic were recommended by the CDC, are no longer on the CDC’s list of recommended face coverings in the age of omicron. Though any mask is better than no mask, some offer higher levels of protection than others. The most important thing to remember when deciding which beard-friendly mask to get is that it needs to fit properly and, to maximize your protection, the fit should eliminate any gaps through which air can flow. This includes N95 or KN95 masks and cloth masks. But until more N95 and KN95 masks are made in larger sizes — and maybe even specifically for those with facial hair — we did some digging around the web and asked HuffPost readers across Facebook and Twitter for their recommendations on the best masks for beards.

9,New Studies Offer Reassurance On COVID Vaccines And Fertility,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost From the moment COVID vaccines became available, misinformation began swirling about their potential effect on fertility. But two new studies, including one of the largest on the topic to date, add to an ever-growing body of research showing that the COVID-19 vaccines do not hurt fertility — though getting COVID might. Doctors hope the new research will reassure vaccine-hesitant patients who are trying to conceive or are expecting a baby. As of early January, only about 40% of pregnant people had been vaccinated against COVID-19. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about the vaccines and about pregnancy,” Jane Frederick, a reproductive endocrinologist based in California, told HuffPost. “But we should be encouraging all of our pregnant patients and people who are thinking about fertility treatments to all get vaccinated and protect themselves.” A large study published Tuesday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology is one of the biggest to date to explore outcomes among patients undergoing fertility treatments, which included more than 2,000 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, or IVF. Researchers compared outcomes among patients who’d received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines with those who were unvaccinated. They found no significant differences in those patients’ response to ovarian stimulation (when eggs are harvested), egg quality, embryo development or overall pregnancy outcomes. “Our findings that vaccination had no impact on these outcomes should be reassuring to those who are trying to conceive or are in early pregnancy,” said study author Devora Aharon in a press release. Aharon is a fellow in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Icahn Mount Sinai and Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York. Her team’s study comes on the heels of another research paper published last week that looked at data from 2,100 couples in Canada and the United States for a year and concluded that COVID vaccines do not impair fertility in men or women. For men, however, getting infected with the coronavirus might. That study found that men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of their partner’s menstrual cycle were 18% less likely to conceive during that cycle, suggesting that COVID infection itself might hurt sperm quality — at least in the short term. “Any fever and active infection can temporarily decrease sperm count in men,” Lora Shahine, a reproductive endocrinologist and founder of the Center for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss at Pacific NW Fertility, told HuffPost. “We’ve seen this with measles, mumps, zika and now COVID.” The low vaccination rate among pregnant people in the United States has raised alarms with public health officials and suggests that vaccine hesitancy continues to be a problem in this population. Experts say that they hope new research will help assuage concerns people may have as they try to conceive and that it encourages anyone with lingering questions to talk to their doctor. “If all the information you get is on Facebook and Instagram, you’re not getting the best information. Talk to your fertility doctor, your primary care doctor, everybody in our fields are on the same page about your health,” Frederick said. Reproductive experts are hopeful more patients will come around. Shahine said that more of her patients have grown comfortable with the idea of getting vaccinated as more research has come out. “I am seeing the vast majority of my fertility patients getting vaccinated and boosted as more reassuring data emerges,” she said. If you’ve been vaccinated and boosted and still experience a breakthrough infection, take heart. Though the new research does suggest that getting COVID could hamper male fertility in the near term, getting vaccinated helps provide significant protection to yourself and your baby, and can lower the likelihood of partners passing the virus to each other. And being vaccinated helps protect people who are pregnant and who get infected from getting seriously sick. By contrast, those who are unvaccinated are at higher risk of severe illness, preterm birth and other pregnancy complications. “We now know that vaccination is an important step for decreasing risk in pregnancy,” Shahine said.

0,White House Pulls Vaccine-Or-Test Mandate Following Supreme Court Decision,coronavirus," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The White House disclosed Tuesday that it is officially withdrawing a new emergency federal rule that would have required workers at large employers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing. The announcement in the Federal Register comes on the heels of a recent Supreme Court decision that blocked the White House from enforcing the rule while litigation played out. The justices ruled 6-3 that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration exceeded its legal authority by putting such a vaccine-or-test mandate in place. The decision had made the emergency rule’s future legally untenable, and the Labor Department said it was pulling the regulation ​​”after evaluating the Court’s decision” on the matter. But the agency added that it would keep the rule in place as a proposal, and pursue instituting it through the regular rulemaking process, which can take years. The Biden administration has moved ahead with several federal vaccine rules aimed at boosting vaccination rates among workers, although several have run into trouble in court. Business groups and state GOP leaders have sued to stop them from going into effect, arguing that they curtail freedoms and require acts of Congress. Rules applying to federal contractors and federal employees have been temporarily blocked by injunctions in federal court. But on the same day it blocked the OSHA rule, the Supreme Court ruled that the administration could proceed with a separate rule mandating vaccination for workers at health facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid funding. The OSHA rule was arguably the most sweeping of the regulations. Although it did not require anyone to get vaccinated — workers could show proof of a negative COVID test each week instead — it applied to a huge swath of the workforce. Businesses with at least 100 workers would have had to implement such vaccine-or-testing programs, covering an estimated 84 million workers. The six conservative justices all joined in the decision against the Biden administration in the OSHA case, while the three liberal justices dissented. The majority argued that OSHA could not institute such a mandate because COVID-19 was not an occupational hazard but a general one. OSHA, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his opinion, was trying to “regulate not just what happens inside the workplace but induce individuals to undertake a medical procedure that affects their lives outside the workplace.” In their dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said the majority was substituting its own public health judgments for those of the actual experts. “If OSHA’s Standard is far-reaching — applying to many millions of American workers — it no more than reflects the scope of the crisis,” they wrote. The rule regarding health care facilities survived by a 5-4 decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining their liberal colleagues. The White House suffered another legal setback on the vaccine front last week, when a federal judge in Texas blocked the administration from enforcing a mandate for federal workers. The judge, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, pointed to the Supreme Court’s decision in the OSHA case, calling a vaccine requirement for federal workers “a bridge too far.” This post has been updated to note that the White House may pursue the vaccine-or-test mandate through the regular rulemaking process.

1,"2 Years After Closing Offices, Social Security Schedules Tentative Reopening",coronavirus," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Byron Jones just wanted a printout with his Social Security number on it so he could apply for an apartment. But when Jones showed up to the Social Security office in Northeast D.C. with a receipt saying he’d filled out an online application for a replacement card, a man at the door turned him away, explaining the office is closed except for appointments. Jones, a 45-year-old hospital worker, didn’t know what else to do. If he has to wait until the replacement card arrives in the mail, he said, he’ll miss his chance this week to fill out a rental application for the apartment he wants. “No one answers the phone,” he said. “It hangs up on me and then when I get down to the Social Security place, they say I’m not allowed to come in.” The Social Security Administration shuttered its 1,230 field offices at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, saying the closure “protects the population we serve — older Americans and people with underlying medical conditions” as well as the agency’s employees. This month, the agency announced it had reached a reopening agreement with the three unions that represent most of its workforce, though it didn’t specify when. The earliest possible date is the end of March. “Dependent on the course of the pandemic, we will continue with our reentry for most employees on March 30,” Social Security spokesperson Mark Hinkle said in an email, adding that the agency needs time to make sure it can properly notify employees and put safety measures in place consistent with union agreements. “We anticipate that field offices will restore increased in-person service to the public, without an appointment, in early April,” Hinkle said. “As we expand in-person availability, we strongly encourage the public to continue to go online, call us for help, and schedule appointments in advance. Customers who walk in without appointments may encounter delays.” The agreement between the Social Security Administration and the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 45,000 Social Security workers, calls for a phased reopening to begin at the end of March so long as ongoing talks between the agency and the union continue smoothly. “If pandemic conditions allow for reopening on March 30, we want to be able to reopen our installations on that date,” Rich Couture, chief negotiator for the union on the reentry plans, said in an interview. Couture is president of the AFGE’s Council 215, which represents employees in the Social Security office overseeing disability benefits hearings. March 30 would be more than two years after the original shutdown, not to mention much later than public schools and many other basic government services resumed operations following their initial shutdowns. Republicans have called for an immediate reopening and criticized the Social Security Administration’s limited in-person services, which require appointments that aren’t easy to arrange. “This is a challenge for many individuals, especially seniors in rural areas, who do not have reliable telephone or internet access,” a group of Senate Republicans said in a December letter to Social Security’s acting commissioner, Kilolo Kijakazi. “Of additional concern is the impact the closed field offices have on individuals who qualify for benefits but are discouraged from applying for them.” The office closures have had a real impact on people’s lives. The number of applications for disability insurance, for instance, fell from 2 million before the pandemic to 1.8 million in 2020, while benefit awards tumbled 10% that year and 11% in 2021. “Claims have been decreasing for many years, but that drop got much steeper during the pandemic,” said Stacy Cloyd, director of policy for the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives. Cloyd did not fault the agency for closing its offices in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 860,000 Americans, with a disproportionate impact on the elderly and people with health issues. “Having the field offices operate the way they’ve always been operating was understandably not an option,” Cloyd said. “If pandemic conditions allow for reopening on March 30, we want to be able to reopen our installations on that date.” The Social Security Administration initially sought to reopen earlier this month, but the AFGE balked at the agency’s plan, partly because it would not have required office visitors to wear masks, which will be required under the new agreements. The union also won teleworking privileges for more of its members, something that had been a major point of contention between the union and the agency prior to the pandemic. “We’re happy with the fact that we’re able to secure provisions in this agreement that will allow us to maximize telework participation across the board, where we wouldn’t normally have been able to under our current contracts,” Couture said. While Republicans have criticized the agency, Democrats have tried to walk a finer line among the stakeholders involved, namely their constituents who need better service and the agency employees who want to stay as safe as possible. “If you’re somebody who’s in need of the benefits of Social Security, it doesn’t matter what the other side is because your concern is your disability, your pension or your dependent or spousal coverage that you’re counting on,” Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) told HuffPost. “It’s also equally valid to say, well, wait a minute, we’re in the midst of a pandemic, and there are guidelines, rules and safety and health precautions all that have to be followed, as well.” Jones, for his part, was just one of five people HuffPost observed knocking on the Northeast D.C. field office door Monday and being turned away — all within half an hour. In May 2021, the Social Security Administration announced people who need replacement cards can arrange special “express interviews,” but only if they’re unable to order a new card online, as Jones had already done. Jones said he had planned to apply for an apartment this week and the card won’t arrive on time, and all he needed was some other document proving he had a Social Security number. The field office worker who turned Jones away gave him a number to call. He dialed it right away and got a busy signal.

2,"Elton John Tests Positive For COVID, Postpones Farewell Tour",coronavirus," National Reporter, HuffPost A positive COVID-19 test has forced Elton John to postpone at least two shows in Dallas, where he was scheduled to perform Tuesday and Wednesday nights. “Hi everyone, wanted to send a message to let you know that I have contracted COVID and so have had to reschedule my shows in Dallas,” John told his fans on Instagram. “If you have tickets, you’ll be contacted with the new dates really soon. It’s always a massive disappointment to move shows and I’m so sorry to anyone who’s been inconvenienced by this but I want to keep myself and my team safe.” The 74-year-old rock legend added that he’s vaccinated, boosted and only experiencing mild symptoms, and expressed optimism he’ll be able to pick back up this weekend for a show in Little Rock, Arkansas. The “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” tour has had a rocky path since its inception in 2018. In addition to a two-year hiatus caused by the pandemic, John also fell and injured his hip, delaying a planned European leg until 2023. John told the “Today Show” last year that he’s eager to stop touring so he can spend more time with his husband and two kids. “I’ll be 76 [when the tour is over],” he said. “I don’t know how much time I have left on this earth after that. You know, I’ve had enough applause. I don’t want to keep traveling. I don’t want to be away from my family.” National Reporter, HuffPost"
3,I Was An ER Nurse For 10 Years. These Are The Nightmare Conditions That Made Me Quit.,coronavirus," Guest Writer I am an emergency room nurse in a large U.S. city, and after a decade of working in hospitals, I want out. And I’m not the only medical professional who is quitting ― hundreds of thousands of us have since 2020. The stress we are encountering currently because of the fallout from a mishandled pandemic is what is finally breaking my colleagues and myself. I would like to give you a glimpse of my last day spent in the ER ― my latest, as I received assignments at various hospitals throughout my career by using a travel contracting company ― to understand the gravity of what is happening. I rush from one end of the emergency room to the other, dialing the pharmacy for some antibiotics that I have been waiting several hours for. I have just finished unsuccessfully coding one patient, while another decides to forgo her call light, and, instead, unsteadily walk out of her room to get me while I’m signing the other patient’s death paperwork. The patient who left her bed to get me falls and hits her head. The doctor, who witnesses the fall too, does not look up from his desk when it happens. “She’s going home,” he tells me. “No she isn’t, because she JUST FELL AND HIT HER HEAD. She needs a CT scan and this is a sentinel event,” I argue. “Ok, I’ll order a CT. Then she is leaving,” he replies. I guide her to a bed closer to the nurses station so that I might be able to hear her better if she needs me. The reality is we do not have enough staff to assist her with her needs while I am stuck in emergency after emergency. Moments earlier, the patient who died just before that woman fell was pushed into Room 9 with firefighters pumping on his chest. He was waiting outside with them in critical condition and he coded in the ambulance bay. Because we are so short-staffed, I asked the firefighter to continue to assist with the chest compressions while I provided medications to try to save his life. As I received the report from the transporting nurse, I learned that the patient had an active bleed and was given two units of blood at the previous facility where he was being treated. They ran out of blood there. “Would you like me to run and get STAT blood, doctor?” I asked as I looked down at the pale, motionless body in front of me. “No,” he replied. “We only have two units left, and we are saving it for any emergency pregnancy complications.” This is when I learned that all of the local hospitals are in dire need of immediate blood. Two units will not save a hemorrhaging pregnant woman ― not even close. I am watching my country’s health care system crumble in front of me, and this man is just one of its many casualties. “I am watching my country’s health care system crumble in front of me, and this man is just one of its many casualties.” A little while later I ask the doctor, “Are you planning on speaking with the deceased patient’s family? Would you like the phone number of his daughter?” He tells me to call the man’s primary provider to take care of the death certificate and speak with the family. I follow his orders. Shortly afterward, I see a young couple standing outside the code room. They are the distressed family members of the deceased patient. I ask the couple if anyone has spoken with them yet. They tell me they were led by hospital security to the body of the patient without anyone speaking with them. I ask the doctor who coded the patient if he will speak with the family to explain that we tried to save his life and hopefully ease their pain. He tells me no. I ask the on-duty social worker if he will speak with the family. He refuses. Suddenly, I hear a wailing sound from Bed 6 — the patient who fell. I am unable to provide a moment of comfort to the family of the deceased man in Room 9. I run to the bedside of the woman in Bed 6. She needs medicine for pain ― immediately. I obtain a STAT morphine and Zofran order from the doctor. I enter the orders in the computer because the doctor, with so many ER patients solely under his care, is too busy to do so. Soon after, the woman’s discharge paperwork comes in, but she is still crying from intractable pain. She is a multiple myeloma patient and the medications she is taking at home are not helping with her pain today. Are we allowed to admit her because she is unsteady and her pain is severe? The answer is no. We can’t allow her to occupy the bed ― there’s simply no room for her. I provide her with a walker and wheel her out in a wheelchair to a taxi as tears roll down her cheeks. “I’m sorry,” I say and then instruct her to call 911 if anything becomes “worse.” Earlier, I was forced to discharge a young homeless man with no shoes and no pants who was disabled from previous multiple strokes and who today was unable to even use the toilet by himself. I had already “gone up the chain of command” with my concern about what I felt was his dangerous discharge, but I was brushed off. I am worried he will not live the next few days. Meanwhile, I finally have the antibiotics for my patient in Bed 7. I had been waiting several hours for an emergency PICC line (which is a catheter in the vein) to be placed so that they could be administered to him. All of his veins were shot from drug abuse and this is the only way to provide him with his medication. He has a septic hip, and hours without antibiotics could prove critical for him. I run to his bedside but I now have another new patient in another room who needs me. Thankfully, another nurse is able to assist and provide the first antibiotic to the man in Bed 7 while I help the new patient. I am then called to the nursing station to finish the code paperwork from earlier in the day. I’m told to leave my patients once more to hand-deliver the paperwork to the nursing supervisor’s office. I text my travel contract company, which is how I got this job. “I can’t do this another day,” I write, adding, “Please take me off this contract.” I approach the nursing office at 7 p.m., which is the end of my shift. I let my superiors know about the fall, reiterate my concern about the unstable discharges (which I did not agree with), and apologize for pulling my contract. They respond by stating, “Why didn’t you call us at the time of the fall? Did you make an incident report?” “No. I was in a code. You can look through my chart notes and write your own incident report, because I am no longer in contract with you,” I reply. The mechanical responses from upper management further indicate a total failure of leadership. I am the third nurse (that I know of) in the last few days that has quit this unit. “I spent days on the unit without a break for food or to use the restroom. By the end of just three days, I developed a urinary tract infection and lost a few pounds off my already small frame.” This day was just one of many, many days like this at many different hospitals. The past years have been marked by chaos stemming from the total mismanagement of staff ratios, which have resulted in abysmal patient care and, ultimately, deaths. On my first day at this particular ER, the unit had run out of pulse oximeters, which measure oxygen levels, for several hours. I had two patients going to the ICU, both of whom were incredibly unstable, one other in respiratory failure with COVID-19, and another with SVT (a dangerous heart rhythm). There were only three nurses working in the ER. An entire ICU floor had been closed due to a staff COVID-19 breakout, which meant there were seven ICU patients stuck on hold in the ER. I said a prayer and placed two monitors from triage in my deteriorating patients’ rooms so that I could see their oxygenation. I spent days on the unit without a break for food or to use the restroom. By the end of just three days, I developed a urinary tract infection and lost a few pounds off my already small frame. These are just a few examples of what ER nurses are struggling with every single day in hospitals across the United States. This is why we are quitting in droves. And much of our system was broken even before COVID-19 came along. The pandemic just made it all that much clearer. I want to help my patients ― when I graduated nursing school I dedicated myself to saving lives ― but I refuse to be responsible for the systematic failures of the facilities that I am beholden to. I refuse to watch my patients die because of absolute chaos that could otherwise be avoided, while, sadly, we are told to keep quiet as the ship we’re on sinks. When we ask for help, we are threatened by administrators and told to remain “professional” in the face of extreme emotional turmoil. We are understaffed, under-resourced, and physically and emotionally exhausted. We continue to give and give, even when there’s literally nothing left to give, because we want to help our patients, even if it means hurting ourselves. I have seen horrible things and watched people die but the thing that I think has traumatized me the most is what I now know about the internal workings of the health care system, which prioritizes finances over lives, while the public remains trusting and unaware. Where do we go from here? How can we transform this system in the wake of such unbelievable catastrophe? Are we failing because health care remains a “for profit” enterprise? Are we failing because multiple other societal structures are collapsing and everything is intertwined? Where has the humanity in the world gone? I don’t have the answers. I don’t even know what’s next for me. But I know things can’t continue this way ― not for me personally and not for our country. We need to have this conversation before it’s too late. I pray it isn’t already. Sally Ersun is a pseudonym used by the author to protect her privacy. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

4,Overwhelmed By COVID News? Here's What To Monitor And What To Skip.,coronavirus," On Assignment For HuffPost As we push through another year of the global coronavirus crisis, there’s no doubt that the devastating effects of the pandemic have taken a collective toll on our mental health. Staying informed about COVID-19 is critical, but it can also be triggering. Between new variants like omicron cropping up and thousands of people getting sick each day, the all-encompassing stress of the “new normal” we’ve been navigating can be hard to take in. “After two years of chronic stress and a universal trauma, most people are beyond their capacity to take on any more stressors,” Neha Chaudhary, the chief medical officer of BeMe Health, told HuffPost. “If you’re feeling overwhelmed by COVID-19 news, just know you’re not alone.” So what can you do to stay up-to-date about the latest COVID news, but feel less mentally drained? We asked a few medical experts to share their advice. Here’s what they had to say. With COVID-19 dominating the news cycle, it may seem scary to think about the future of the pandemic. But ultimately, the global nature of this health threat is not within your control. One thing you can do is stay informed about protocols in your local community and do your part to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. “Pay attention to public health guidelines in your area, such as getting vaccinated and boosted and wearing masks for protection,” Sharon Chekijian, an emergency medicine physician at Yale Medicine, told HuffPost. Additionally, keeping tabs on the levels of spread in your community will help guide the right decisions for you and your family. “Living life in this limbo of outbreaks, variants, exposures and illness can feel overwhelming as we are constantly needing to evaluate risk, assess our circumstances, and make changes in our daily lives,” said Madeline Lucas, a therapist and clinical content manager at Real, a digital mental health and therapy platform. Don’t forget to check in with yourself and prioritize your well-being while consuming all this information. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a break to redirect your energy elsewhere by taking a walk or calling a friend, Lucas said. “If you’re feeling overwhelmed by COVID-19 news, just know you’re not alone.” In addition to staying plugged in to your local guidelines, it may be helpful to learn other key pieces of information, such as school closure policies, travel guidance and testing recommendations. This information can help you make decisions you’re comfortable with for you and your family’s safety, Chekijian said. While staying informed, understand that it’s OK to skip or take time off from content you find particularly distressing or triggering. Setting boundaries ahead of time will help limit your exposure to the influx of alarming COVID-related headlines. “Set aside some time to have parameters around your emotional capacity for news content,” said Naiylah Warren, a therapist and clinical content manager at Real. “Maybe that means spending only 20 minutes watching the news on television or reading only two articles a day.” It’s common for news stories to focus on the disastrous impact of the pandemic, which can incite fear and helplessness. While it’s important to be aware of the reality of everything going on, it might help to be more selective about your media consumption and to surround yourself with uplifting, solution-based stories that bring you joy. The World Health Organization recommends focusing on stories of recovery to promote positivity and hopefulness. Finding a balance between staying informed and not feeling overwhelmed by the news cycle may be difficult, but things like setting boundaries and taking breaks can make a tremendous impact on your mental health and well-being for the better.

5,"Neil Young Rips Conspiracy Theorist Joe Rogan, Puts Spotify On Blast",coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Rock icon Neil Young is calling out Spotify for distributing the misinformation-filled podcast by conspiracy theorist Joe Rogan. “I want you to let Spotify know immediately today that I want all of my music off their platform,“ Young wrote to his managers in a letter initially posted on his website on Monday. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” The since-deleted letter said the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer is actively canceling all of his music availability on Spotify because the company “is spreading false information about vaccines — potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them.” Young’s music remained on Spotify as of early Tuesday. Spotify’s Neil Young page said he has more than 6 million monthly listeners, and his top three songs combined have received more than half a billion listens on the service. Rogan claims to have 200 million listeners, a massive audience that led to a $100 million payday from Spotify when the company signed him to an exclusive multiyear contract in 2020. Since then, he’s used the platform to falsely suggest that young, healthy people don’t need to be vaccinated, then later called himself a “fucking moron” and “not a respected source of information.” However, Rogan’s also doubled down by promoting more misinformation and inviting on guests who do the same. Earlier this month, 270 scientists, doctors, health care workers and professors signed an open letter slamming Rogan as “a menace to public health” and calling on Spotify to establish a misinformation policy. Young has gone in the opposite direction of Rogan. While many performers have returned to the road, he hasn’t. Young even cancelled a planned appearance at Farm Aid, which he cofounded, over COVID-19 concerns last year. “I don’t want to let anybody down, but still can’t shake the feeling that it might not be safe for everyone,” Young wrote on his website at the time, adding: “All you people who can’t go to a concert because you still don’t feel safe, I stand with you. I don’t want you to see me playing and think it’s safe now. I don’t want to play until you feel safe, and it is indeed, safe. My soul tells me it would be wrong to risk having anyone die because they wanted to hear music and be with friends.” Last month, Young said he won’t be touring anytime soon for the same reason. “I don’t care if I’m the only one who doesn’t do it,” he told Howard Stern. Young’s newest album, “Barn” debuted last month on most streaming services, but if his letter is any indication, it may not be on Spotify much longer. He also released a documentary about the album on YouTube: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
6,Whoopi Goldberg Slams Bill Maher’s ‘Flippant’ COVID Commentary,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Bill Maher complained about living in a “masked, paranoid world” last week, and Whoopi Goldberg wasn’t having it. In his “Real Time” show monologue on Friday, Maher suggested that the coronavirus pandemic had “gone on too long” and “nobody cares anymore.” “You go out, it’s silly now. You have to have your mask, you have to have a card, you have to have a booster,” the comedian said. “They scan your head like you’re a cashier and I’m a bunch of bananas. I’m not bananas, you are.” On Monday’s episode of “The View,” co-host Goldberg called out Maher for being “flippant.” “That’s not really funny to people who have lost their kids … or people who have lost family members or dear friends to this,” she said. “Listen, nobody on the planet really wants to go through this. This is not something we’re doing because it’s sexually gratifying. This is what we’re doing to protect our families.” “I want to point out, there are little kids who can’t get vaccinated,” Goldberg added. “Lots of people who cannot get vaccinated, so you’re playing Russian roulette with their lives.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Cheryl Hines Addresses Her Husband Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Bonkers Anti-Vax Tirade,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Cheryl Hines said the opinions of her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are “not a reflection of my own” after he peddled a series of bizarre and unfounded coronavirus conspiracy theories over the weekend. Kennedy, a son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.), compared the experience of anti-vaxxers to that of victims of the Holocaust, referenced Anne Frank and ranted about 5G technology during a rally against vaccine mandates in Washington, D.C. His comments drew widespread criticism. On Twitter, the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum said that “exploiting of the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany — including children like Anne Frank — in a debate about vaccines & limitations during global pandemic is a sad symptom of moral & intellectual decay.” When another Twitter user responded to the institution’s tweet to ask whether Hines stood with her husband, she responded: “My husband’s opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.” My husband’s opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues. When someone else suggested she share the statement that “no one should compare anything to the horrors of the Holocaust” and that “my husband was wrong to do so,” Hines said she agreed. How about this? ""No one should compare anything to the horrors of the Holocaust. My husband was wrong to do so."" Yes, I agree with you. The next morning, Hines tweeted another statement condemning Kennedy’s remarks. “My husband’s reference to Anne Frank at a mandate rally in D.C. was reprehensible and insensitive,” she wrote. The atrocities that millions endured during the Holocaust should never be compared to anyone or anything. His opinions are not a reflection of my own.” Hines and Kennedy, who wed in 2014, have put their differences regarding the coronavirus on display before. Guests to their 2021 holiday party were instructed to get vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 before attending. Kennedy, one of the biggest peddlers of vaccine disinformation online, said the invitations had been handled by Hines — and that he hadn’t known of the request. “I guess I’m not always the boss at my own house,” he said at the time.

8,Eric Clapton Claims People Who Receive COVID-19 Vaccines Are Under 'Mass Hypnosis',coronavirus," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Eric Clapton is doubling down on his criticisms of COVID-19 safety protocols, arguing that those who are getting vaccinated are victims of “subliminal advertising” by pharmaceutical companies on social media. The 17-time Grammy winner made the eyebrow-raising claim in a video interview with “The Real Music Observer” that first appeared on YouTube last week. In it, he was asked about his decision to team up with Van Morrison, another vaccine skeptic, on the 2020 single “Stand and Deliver,” which compared COVID-19 lockdowns to slavery. “Whatever the memo was, it hadn’t reached me,” Clapton said. “Then I realized there really was a memo — a guy, Mattias Desmet, has talked about it. It’s great, you know, the theory of mass hypnosis formation. And I could see it, once I kind of started to look for it.” “I saw it everywhere,” he continued. “And then I remembered seeing little things on YouTube, which were like subliminal advertising. It’s been going on for a long time — that thing of ‘you will own nothing and you will be happy.’” Clapton appeared to be referring to a concept promoted by Desmet, a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium. Desmet’s widely discredited theory suggests people have been “hypnotized” into believing mainstream ideas about COVID-19 such as testing procedures and vaccinations. The term gained momentum after it was discussed by Dr. Robert Malone, another vocal skeptic of COVID-19 vaccines, in an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast that aired last month. Later in the interview, Clapton criticized the media for perpetuating what he described as “completely one-way traffic about following orders and obedience” and implied he’d channeled his frustrations into music. In addition to “Stand and Deliver,” he released an anti-vaccination anthem, “This Has Gotta Stop,” in August of last year. “These guys that were in power really started to piss me [off] ... but I had a tool,” he explained. “I had a calling and I can make use of that, so I set about it and started writing.” Clapton, 76, has criticized COVID-19 vaccines after outlining what he described as “disastrous” health consequences upon receiving the AstraZeneca jab last year. He later vowed never to perform at music venues that require proof of vaccinations, but seemingly backtracked on that pledge by taking the stage at New Orleans’ Smoothie King Center ― where attendees were required to show vaccination cards or test negative for COVID-19 before entering ― in September.

9,Virginia School Boards Sue Gov. Youngkin Over Optional-Mask Order,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost The boards of seven school districts in Virginia are suing the newly seated Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) over his order that effectively lifts mask mandates for students in the state’s public schools. The school boards — including that of Fairfax County, the state’s biggest school district — filed a lawsuit against Youngkin Monday, challenging the governor’s ability to “unilaterally infringe upon” the decisions of local school districts to require masking for student and staff safety amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The suit, filed in the Arlington County Circuit Court, also contends that Youngkin cannot overrule a state Senate bill that requires Virginia’s local school boards to follow the health and safety guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they provide in-person instruction. The CDC’s guidance recommends “universal indoor masking by all” students, staff, teachers and visitors to K-12 schools, “regardless of vaccination status.” On Youngkin’s first day in office, Jan. 15, he issued an executive order stating that any parent can “elect for their children not to be subject to any mask mandate” in schools, and that they do not have to “provide a reason or make any certification” to do so. In response to the lawsuit, Youngkin’s spokesperson Macaulay Porter said the governor’s office is “disappointed that these school boards are ignoring parents’ rights,” and plans on “aggressively defending” its position “as the legal process plays out.” Coronavirus cases nationwide remain near a record peak as the omicron variant spreads. Even as cases have started to drop from their highest levels in recent days, on average more than 2,000 people in the U.S. are still dying from the virus each day.

0,NBA Great John Stockton's Season Tickets Suspended Over Mask Refusal,coronavirus," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Gonzaga University has suspended Basketball Hall of Famer John Stockton’s season tickets because he refused to wear a mask while attending games as required, The Spokesman-Review reported over the weekend. “Basically, it came down to, they were asking me to wear a mask to the games and being a public figure, someone a little bit more visible, I stuck out in the crowd a little bit,” Stockton told the newspaper. Stockton, who graduated from the university in 1984, is the NBA’s career leader in assists and steals after nearly two stellar decades with the Utah Jazz. He’s more recently become famous for something else entirely: spreading wild and debunked conspiracy theories about the coronavirus and the vaccines, including an appearance in an anti-vaccine film. Local CBS station KREM said Stockton has been seen at the games all season, sans mask, despite university rules requiring them for attendance at athletic events. The station said several fans had complained about Stockton. Stockton told The Spokesman-Review he hopes to be able to return to the games “when the rules change.” Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
1,'I'm In Hell': Leonard Peltier Pleads For Help Amid Constant COVID Lockdowns In Prison,coronavirus," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Never mind that he shouldn’t be in a federal prison at all. Leonard Peltier, the Native American rights activist whom the FBI put behind bars decades ago without any evidence that he committed a crime, tells HuffPost that his facility’s prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns and failure to provide at least some inmates with booster shots has left him ― and likely others ― unbearably isolated and preparing for death. “I’m in hell,” Peltier said in a Friday statement, “and there is no way to deal with it but to take it as long as you can.” Peltier, who is 77 and has serious health problems including diabetes and an abdominal aortic aneurysm, said “fear and stress” from the prison’s intense coronavirus lockdowns are taking a toll on everyone, including staff. He described conditions like having next to no human contact or access to phones sometimes for weeks, no access to regular showers or substantial food, and not even the ability to look out a window or have fresh air. “Left alone and without attention is like a torture chamber for the sick and old,” he said. Peltier’s facility, a high-security penitentiary in Florida called USP Coleman I, is currently one of 98 federal prisons at a Level 3 COVID-19 operational level, which means its COVID medical isolation rate is at the highest level. For the facility’s 1,335 inmates, this translates to no contact with other people within the facility and no visitation from anyone externally. The Coleman facility has been in its latest COVID lockdown since Jan. 11, according to Peltier’s attorney, Kevin Sharp. It’s been imposing dayslong and sometimes weekslong COVID lockdowns dating back to March 2021. Some of the longer stretches were March 6-15, June 14-30, and Dec. 12-Jan. 4, said Sharp. Peltier says it’s not just mentally excruciating to endure constant lockdowns. He said he and others on his cellblock still haven’t gotten their COVID booster shots. They should have been offered them by now; all people incarcerated in federal prisons gained access to the initial round of vaccines last May, which means it’s well past the six-month window for getting boosted to stave off potential serious illness or death. In Peltier’s case, he got his first COVID-19 vaccination shot in January 2021 and his second in May 2021, according to Sharp, which means he was due for his booster in November. Peltier asks the prison’s medical staff “every chance he gets” when he and others in his cellblock will get their booster shots, said Sharp, and they always say they don’t know. People living in prisons are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 because of factors like being in close quarters, poor ventilation in old facilities and the fact that some prison staff aren’t getting vaccinated. But when lockdowns mean being denied human contact for weeks at a time and no details on when a COVID-19 vaccine booster will be available, the situation feels untenable for inmates like Peltier. “They are turning an already harsh environment into an asylum,” he said. It’s hard to know how many people within the massive federal prison system have not received their booster shots. There are currently 153,855 people incarcerated in federal prisons, of which 135,100 are in facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Donald Murphy, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said the department isn’t making data publicly available relating to inmates’ booster shot rates. Instead, he pointed to the department’s COVID resource webpage, which includes data on the total number of COVID-19 vaccination shots that have been given to inmates and staff since last year. “We are not breaking this number down to reflect booster shots only,” he said. The Bureau of Prisons has received a total of 316,714 doses and administered 287,681 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to staff and inmates since it became available last May, according to its website. Those numbers include the two-dose vaccines offered by Pfizer and Moderna, and the one-dose vaccine offered by Johnson & Johnson. As for the conditions Peltier described at the Coleman facility, Murphy declined to comment on “anecdotal allegations” or on “conditions of confinement for any particular inmate.” He did say that the Coleman facility “is currently administering COVID booster vaccinations for inmates,” despite the fact that Peltier has not been offered one and has seen no signs of it being offered to other inmates on his cellblock. Murphy also said the Bureau of Prisons follows Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance with regard to COVID-19 quarantine and medical isolation procedures. Here’s Peltier’s full statement on the conditions inside Coleman, provided to HuffPost: COVID has turned Coleman Prison back to the Dark Ages. I remember a time at Marion USP when I was put in solitary for so long, when 72 hours could make you start to forget who you were. I once wrote down who I was on the concrete floor under my bed, so if I forgot, I could read it back to myself. I traded my last cigarette for a pencil. I’d rush to the door when a guard left the meager plate of food, just to see a glimpse of another human being — even if it was one that hated me, it was another human and good for my mind for a minute. I’m in hell, and there is no way to deal with it but to take it as long as you can. I cling to the belief that people are out there doing what they can to change our circumstances in here. The fear and stress are taking a toll on everyone, including the staff. You can see it in their faces and hear it in their voices. The whole institution is on total LOCKDOWN. In and out of lockdown last year at least meant a shower every third day, a meal beyond a sandwich wet with a little peanut butter — but now with COVID for an excuse, nothing. No phone, no window, no fresh air — no humans to gather — no love ones voice. No relief. Left alone and without attention is like a torture chamber for the sick and old. Where are our human rights activists? You are hearing from me, and with me, many desperate men and women! They are turning an already harsh environment into an asylum, and for many who did not receive a death penalty, we are now staring down the face of one! Help me, my brothers and sisters, help me my good friends. Peltier is America’s longest-serving political prisoner. He’s been behind bars for 45 years for the 1975 murders of two FBI agents during a shootout on a Native American reservation ― something he has long said he didn’t do, even when it meant he could have been paroled if he said he did. His trial was riddled with misconduct and even the U.S. attorney who helped put Peltier in prison so long ago is now pleading with President Joe Biden to grant him clemency because, he says, federal officials never had evidence that he committed a crime. His imprisonment has drawn protests from an astounding mix of international human rights leaders including Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela and Coretta Scott King. Elected tribal leaders and the National Congress of American Indians have also passed resolutions urging clemency. Biden is likely Peltier’s last chance at freedom before he dies in prison.

2,'Endemic' Doesn't Mean What You Think It Does,coronavirus," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost Health officials have been warning for months that COVID-19 isn’t going away; instead, it’s much more likely to become endemic here in the United States and abroad. Many also believe the highly contagious omicron variant, which continues to drive up case counts around much of the country, could get us there. While moving from our current pandemic to an endemic state certainly sounds like a move in the right direction, health experts also caution that it doesn’t necessarily mean what people think it does. It’s certainly not the “normal” reality people lived up until 2019. Nor is our path to endemicity clear cut. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, endemic “refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.” The endemic level of disease in a given area is basically the baseline of that disease in a particular place. But it’s not necessarily the desired level of disease, the CDC clarifies. A disease could be considered endemic but still be pretty widespread. “An endemic disease is an infection that always remains in a given population,” Vincent Hsu, executive director of infection control at AdventHealth, told HuffPost. “It might be limited to a particular geographic area, such as malaria, but could also be a widespread infection that has seasonal patterns, such as influenza, or continues throughout the year causing generally mild illness, such as the common cold.” And knowing when exactly the transition from pandemic to endemic has happened is difficult, because health officials and epidemiologists may have different thresholds for when we’ve hit a sufficiently predictable, non-disruptive point of living with COVID. It’s a pretty nuanced term. “Practically speaking, for COVID to become endemic, we would need to be at a point where COVID is sufficiently commonplace that it is not causing severe disease resulting in hospitalizations and death,” said Jay Lee, a family physician in Costa Mesa, California. “In other words, we need community immunity against COVID to be high enough that we are not seeing the levels of hospitalization and death we continue to see now.” “Think of this surge as the 10th round of a heavyweight boxing match, and we are enduring a flurry of punches like we haven’t seen yet.” Moving from our current state (a pandemic) to endemic disease sounds like a good thing, and in many ways it is. But some experts worry that the general public is assuming that endemic disease is automatically less damaging or dangerous. We could get to a point where COVID is considered endemic, but its impact on many people who are infected is not minimal. (Again, think of malaria, which is endemic in parts of the world and can be deadly.) There could also still be unpredictable disruptions caused by the virus that would prompt restrictions and closures that would not feel at all “mild” at a society level. If the virus continues to infect relatively large numbers of people, it has more opportunities to change its genome. Take flu as an example. Most people who get the illness recover within a few weeks, but for some, it is deadly. Also, we sometimes get flu pandemics which, as the CDC explains, occur when a new virus emerges that is able to spread from person to person in an efficient and sustained way. “What we see with influenza is decades between major pandemics, and the major pandemics are due to shuffling of segments of the flu virus genome, which are known as genetic shifts,” infectious diseases expert Stuart Ray, vice chair of medicine for data integrity with Johns Hopkins Medicine, told HuffPost. Those shifts are what cause the major flu pandemics we’ve experienced, like H1N1 in 2009. But it’s not yet clear how much time we might get between genetic shifts with COVID. And if the virus is still infecting large numbers of people, it has more opportunities to change its genome. “A part of me is hopeful that with this omicron wave, we’ll generate enough immunity that we don’t see a lot of harm from future infections, and that we will reach a mild endemic state,” Ray said. “But I don’t know how stable that will be. And we might be dancing on a knife’s edge.” “A part of me is hopeful that with this omicron wave, we’ll generate enough immunity that we don’t see a lot of harm from future infections, and that we will reach a mild endemic state. But I don’t know how stable that will be. And we might be dancing on a knife’s edge.” That said, all of the experts who spoke to HuffPost for this story expressed cautious optimism that we can get to a point where COVID is endemic and we’re not caught off-guard by constant new disruptions or dangerous new variants. “We may reach an endemic state where we have a relative equilibrium of a fairly high rate of infection which fluctuates ... but the fluctuations are narrow enough that people would say this is endemic. We’re not having a big pandemic. Or even epidemics, but just sort of a smoldering rate,” Ray said. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has said it’s not clear whether COVID will become endemic in 2022 as a result of omicron. “I would hope that that’s the case. But that would only be the case if we don’t get another variant that eludes the immune response of the prior variant,” Fauci said. Experts like Lee expressed tempered hope, noting that we’ll likely know more about endemicity as we emerge from the omicron surge in mid-February or so. “Think of this surge as the 10th round of a heavyweight boxing match, and we are enduring a flurry of punches like we haven’t seen yet,” he said. If we hit sufficient community immunity, we’ll be able to have a knockout. If not, we’ll have to endure some more rounds. There are still a lot of unknowns that could impact when we hit the levels of widespread immunity necessary for COVID to become endemic. One is simply how long immunity lasts for people infected with omicron. Another is about what kind of variants could arise as the virus continues to spread and evolve. SARS-CoV-2 is not very stable genetically, and new variants could be more transmissible or more likely to cause severe disease — or both. Just because omicron has generally been milder than what proceeded it does not necessarily mean that would be the case with future variants. People’s behavior as we potentially near the transition from pandemic to endemic disease will make a difference in how and when we get there, experts say. Vaccination, improved ventilation, masking, social distance in times and areas of high transmission — all of those efforts continue to be critically important. If getting close to an endemic state “causes people to relax the use of benign mitigation efforts, like wearing masks when they’re indoors in crowded places at times when transmission rates are high, then we’re going to take longer to get to that mild endemic state,” Ray warned. “Exactly how COVID-19 plays out from here is anyone’s guess,” Hsu said. “At this point, vaccinations and boosters continue to be the single most effective way to prevent severe illness and spread to others.” Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

3,"NFL Ends Daily COVID Testing For All Players, Vaccinated Or Not",coronavirus," The NFL is curtailing daily testing of all players, vaccinated or unvaccinated, for COVID-19. In a memo sent to the 32 clubs and obtained by The Associated Press, the league said Friday that medical experts from the NFL and the players’ union agreed to the change. Those doctors have seen enough evidence of a decrease in positive tests in the last month to feel comfortable with dropping daily tests. Last month, weekly testing for vaccinated players and personnel was stopped, but anyone who reported symptoms of COVID-19 or was part of targeted surveillance still was subjected to testing. “Following consultation with our jointly retained infectious disease experts, the NFL and NFL Players Association have updated the NFL-NFLPA COVID-19 protocols to eliminate the distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated players to determine testing cadence,” the memo said. “Effective immediately, all players and tiered staff will be subject to strategic and targeted testing.” The league will continue symptom-based testing and screening for symptoms. “This comprehensive, symptom-based approach to testing reflects our recent experience with the omicron variant and conforms to current public health recommendations and best practices employed in healthcare,” the memo said, “and offers the best opportunity for identifying and treating cases promptly and avoiding spread within the facility.”"
4,Shaq Reveals How He’d Treat Unvaxxed Kyrie Irving If They Were On Same Team,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal said he’d “put hands on” unvaccinated Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving if they played on the same team. The Nets last month welcomed Irving back into the fold following his refusal to be inoculated from COVID-19. But he can only play road games due to New York City vaccine mandates. This week, Irving refused to reconsider his position on the shots, even following teammate Kevin Durant’s knee injury. Speaking on the latest episode of his “Big Podcast,” O’Neal said: “I don’t see how the team could put up with that, I’m just saying. If he was on my team I’d have to put hands on him.” “I know for a fact that these windows of winning championships, you don’t have them a lot,” he continued. “All that stuff just playing on the road, you can’t get in no rhythm like that.” O’Neal suggested Irving’s part-time role would damage relationships with teammates. “When I won my floor, we was close,” he said. “We was tight, we fought, we argued, we went to each others kids birthday parties, we went to parties on the road, we held secrets, we did a lot of things, we stuck up for each other, we trusted each other, you can’t do that with people coming in and out.” “His stand is his stand, I’m not going to get into the argument of what he should or shouldn’t do,” he added. “But I’m just saying from experience … if you want to win, you have to sacrifice.” Listen to O’Neal’s comments from the 11-minute mark here: Reporter, HuffPost"
5,Another One Of Biden's COVID Vaccine Rules Just Got Blocked In Court,coronavirus," Labor Reporter, HuffPost A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its vaccine mandate for federal employees on Friday, calling the requirement “a bridge too far” in light of recent actions by the Supreme Court. The ruling marks another judicial setback for the White House, which saw a separate vaccine-or-test rule halted by the Supreme Court last week. That rule, issued through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, would apply to large employers across the country. In granting an injunction against the rule for federal workers, Judge Jeffrey Vincent Brown, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, wrote the case is “not about whether folks should get vaccinated against COVID-19,” or even about “federal power.” “It is instead about whether the President can, with the stroke of a pen and without the input of Congress, require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment,” he wrote. Brown said the plaintiffs who oppose Biden’s rule were likely to prevail in court, pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in the OSHA case. The OSHA rule would require employers with at least 100 workers to implement programs in which workers either show proof of vaccination or undergo weekly testing for COVID-19. The injunction issued Friday prevents the administration from trying to enforce the rule for federal employees nationwide while more litigation plays out. But the vast majority of workers are already in compliance with it, the Biden administration said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that 98% of the federal workforce has been vaccinated, a figure she called “remarkable.” Psaki noted that the White House disagreed with Brown’s order, saying “we are confident in our legal authority here.” Biden had issued the rule for federal workers in September. The judge issued the order blocking it on Jan. 21, the same day the government said it could start disciplining workers who weren’t in compliance. The lawsuit against the rule for the federal workforce was brought by Feds for Medical Freedom, a group of federal employees who oppose the mandate, and AFGE Local 918, a labor union that represents workers inside the Department of Homeland Security. In his order, Brown noted that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled in its OSHA decision that COVID-19 was not an occupational health risk but a “universal” one, “no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases.” That assertion outraged occupational safety advocates and backers of the OSHA rule, considering the massive outbreaks that have occurred in meatpacking facilities and other workplaces. On the same day justices ruled against the Biden administration in the OSHA case, they declined to block a different vaccine rule issued by the White House. That rule requires that workers at medical facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid funding get vaccinated against COVID-19.

6,The CDC Is Changing The Way It Talks About Vaccination Status,coronavirus," Reporter, HuffPost As it becomes clear that booster shots significantly improve protection against serious illness from the omicron variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is shifting away from the phrase “fully vaccinated” in favor of calling people “up to date” on their COVID-19 vaccines. “What we really are working to do is pivot the language to make sure that everybody is as up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines as they personally could be ― should be ― based on when they got their last vaccine,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing Friday. “That means if you recently got your second dose and you’re not eligible for a booster, you’re up to date,” she continued. “If you are eligible for a booster and you haven’t gotten it, you’re not up to date, and you need to get your booster in order to be up to date.” But she clarified that the CDC is not attempting to change the definition of “fully vaccinated,” which could have implications for local ordinances that require some employees to be vaccinated in order to return to work. The language shift comes the same day the CDC released three reports showing that receiving the booster dose after the initial round of shots offers significantly improved protection against being hospitalized with COVID-19. One of them found that three shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were nearly 70% effective against omicron-related symptoms when compared with unvaccinated people. With just two doses, the study found, people had no significant protection against omicron symptoms. “It really shows the important of getting a booster dose,” the CDC’s Emma Accorsi, one of the study’s authors, said Friday. As of Sunday, about 30% of fully vaccinated people in the U.S. have received their booster dose. It’s available to people as young as 12 depending on which type of vaccines they received previously.

7,Booster Shots Significantly Improve Protection Against Omicron,coronavirus," NEW YORK (AP) — Three studies released Friday offered more evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are standing up to the omicron variant, at least among people who received booster shots. They are the first large U.S. studies to look at vaccine protection against omicron, health officials said. The papers echo previous research — including studies in Germany, South Africa and the U.K. — indicating available vaccines are less effective against omicron than earlier versions of the coronavirus, but also that boosters significantly improve protection. The first study looked at hospitalizations and emergency room and urgent care center visits in 10 states, from August to this month. It found vaccine effectiveness was best after three doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care visits. Protection dropped from 94% during the delta wave to 82% during the omicron wave. Protection from just two doses was lower, especially if six months had passed since the second dose. The second study focused on COVID-19 case and death rates in 25 states from the beginning of April through Christmas. People who were boosted had the highest protection against coronavirus infection, both during the time delta was dominant and also when omicron was taking over. Those two articles were published online by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Journal of the American Medical Association published the third study, also led by CDC researchers. It looked at people who tested positive for COVID-19 from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1 at more than 4,600 testing sites across the U.S. Three shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were about 67% effective against omicron-related symptomatic disease compared with unvaccinated people. Two doses, however, offered no significant protection against omicron, the researchers found. “It really shows the important of getting a booster dose,” said the CDC’s Emma Accorsi, one of the study’s authors. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

8,California Bill Would Allow Preteens To Be Vaccinated Without Parents' Consent,coronavirus," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California would allow children age 12 and up to be vaccinated without their parents’ consent, the youngest age of any state, under a proposal late Thursday by a state senator. Alabama allows such decisions at age 14, Oregon at 15, Rhode Island and South Carolina at 16, according to Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco who is proposing the change. Only Washington, D.C., has a lower limit, at age 11. Wiener argued that California already allows those 12 and up to consent to the Hepatitis B and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and to treatment for sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse and mental health disorders. “Giving young people the autonomy to receive life-saving vaccines, regardless of their parents’ beliefs or work schedules, is essential for their physical and mental health,” he said. “It’s unconscionable for teens to be blocked from the vaccine because a parent either refuses or cannot take their child to a vaccination site.” Currently in California, minors ages 12 to 17 cannot be vaccinated without permission from their parents or guardian, unless the vaccine is specifically to prevent a sexually transmitted disease. Wiener’s bill would lift the parental requirement for that age group for any vaccine that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes immunizations against the coronavirus, but Wiener said vaccine hesitancy and misinformation has also deterred vaccinations against measles and other contagious diseases that can then spread among youths whose parents won’t agree to have them vaccinated. California Gov. Gavin Newsom in October announced the nation’s first coronavirus vaccine mandate for schoolchildren. But it likely won’t take effect until later this year and allows exemptions for medical reasons, religious and personal beliefs — though lawmakers may try to limit non-medical reasons. Wiener’s legislation is permissive, not a mandate, but any vaccination legislation has been hugely controversial in California and elsewhere. Even before the pandemic, busloads of opponents filled the Capital and lined up for hours to protest bills lifting religious and personal beliefs for the 10 vaccines already required of school children. And in September, more than a thousand people rallied outside the state Capitol to oppose vaccine mandates, even though lawmakers had postponed their consideration of legislation requiring that workers either be vaccinated or get weekly coronavirus testing to keep their jobs. “This to me seems to be another example of Democrats wanting to remove parents from the equation,” said Republican Assemblyman James Gallagher. “I think that’s flawed policy. I think parents are vital to these decisions.” However, he thinks Wiener may have difficulty even in a Legislature overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats. “I think there will be bipartisan support for the proposition that parents should be involved in their kids’ health care decisions, in deciding what types of medical care and drugs they should be taking,” Gallagher said. On Wednesday, Wiener and other Democratic lawmakers announced that they have formed a “work group” to examine ways to promote vaccines and fight misinformation. Members include Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician who authored previous vaccine legislation; Sen. Josh Newman; and Assembly members Dr. Akilah Weber, Buffy Wicks, Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, and Evan Low. Wiener, joined by Pan, planned a news conference about his SB866 Friday alongside San Francisco’s public health director, Dr. Grant Colfax, and several school children. Wiener held out the examples of children who may want to get vaccinated because they currently are barred from participating in sports, band or other activities because their parents either won’t or can’t get them vaccinated. Children age 5 and up are currently eligible for coronavirus vaccines, but 28.6% of those in California ages 12-17 remain unvaccinated — more than 900,000 of an eligible population of more than 3 million, or more than one in four, Wiener said. He said those 12 and up can also consent to abortions in California, though in that case lawmakers in 1987 passed a law that would have required minors to get their parents’ consent absent a medical emergency or a judge’s permission. But that law was overturned by the state Supreme Court."
9,"UN Chief: World Worse Now Than 5 Years Ago Due To COVID, Climate And Conflict",coronavirus," UNITED NATIONS (AP) — As he starts his second term as U.N. secretary-general, Antonio Guterres said Thursday the world is worse in many ways than it was five years ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and geopolitical tensions that have sparked conflicts everywhere — but unlike U.S. President Joe Biden he thinks Russia will not invade Ukraine. Guterres said in an interview with The Associated Press that the appeal for peace he issued on his first day in the U.N.’s top job on Jan. 1, 2017 and his priorities in his first term of trying to prevent conflicts and tackle global inequalities, the COVID-19 crisis and a warming planet haven’t changed. “The secretary-general of the U.N. has no power,” Guterres said. “We can have influence. I can persuade. I can mediate, but I have no power.” Before he became U.N. chief, Guterres said he envisioned the post as being “a convener, a mediator, a bridge-builder and an honest broker to help find solutions that benefit everyone involved.” He said Thursday these are things “I need to do every day.” As an example, the secretary-general said this week he spoke to the African Union’s envoy Olusegun Obasanjo, twice with Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta, and once with Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in his attempt to get a cessation of hostilities in Ethiopia between the government and forces in the embattled Tigray region. “I hope that we are in a situation in which it might become soon possible to have a cessation of hostilities and that is where I’m concentrating most of my efforts,” Guterres said. As another example, Guterres said he has also been on the phone to try to get Mali’s military leaders who recently delayed elections scheduled for next month to 2026 to reduce the timetable. He said he spoke to Mali’s military ruler, President Assimi Goita, three presidents from the 15-nation West African regional group ECOWAS, Algeria’s prime minister and the African Union’s leader about “how to make sure that in Mali, there is an acceptable calendar for the transition to a civilian government.” Guterres said he hopes Mali’s military leaders will understand that they need to accept “a reasonable period” before elections. The secretary-general believes voting should be held in “a relatively short amount of time,” and said: “All my efforts have been in creating conditions for bridging this divide and for allowing ECOWAS and the government of Mali to come to a solution with an acceptable delay for the elections.” Guterres said the U.N. Security Council, which does have the power to uphold international peace and security including by imposing sanctions and ordering military action, is divided, especially its five veto-wielding permanent members. Russia and China are often at odds with the U.S., Britain and France on key issues, including Thursday on new sanctions against North Korea. On the issue on every country’s front burner now — whether Russia, which has massed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, will invade the former Soviet republic — Guterres said, “I do not think Russia will invade Ukraine, and I hope that my belief is correct.” What makes him think Moscow won’t invade when Biden and others believe Russian President Vladimir Putin will send troops into Ukraine? “Because I do not believe in a military solution for the problems that exists, and I think that the most rational way to solve those problems is through diplomacy and through engagement in serious dialogue,” Guterres said, stressing that an invasion would have “terrible consequences.” The secretary-general said “we have been in contact, of course” with top officials in Russia, though the U.N. is not directly engaged in the Ukraine crisis. Guterres is scheduled to deliver a speech to the 193 U.N. member nations in the General Assembly on Friday on his priorities for 2022. He singled out three immediate priorities that “are worrying me enormously”: the lack of vaccinations in large parts of the world, especially in Africa; the need to reduce emissions by 45% in this decade to try to meet the international goal of trying to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit); and the “extremely unjust” financial situation in the world that favors rich countries. Many developing countries have very few resources, high debts that are growing and they pay much higher interest rates than in Europe or North America, have no vaccines, and disproportionately “suffer the impacts of climate change,” Guterres said. “We need a deep reform in our international financial system in order to make sure that there is more justice in the way resources are available to allow for the recovery (from COVID-19) to be possible everywhere,” he said. On another major issue, Guterres stressed that the Afghan people can’t be collectively punished for “wrong things that are done by the Taliban,” so it is absolutely essential to massively increase humanitarian aid “because the Afghans are in a desperate situation with the risks of deaths by hunger” and disease in a frigid winter with COVID-19. “More than half the population is in desperate need of humanitarian aid,” he said, and money needs to be injected into the economy to ensure Afghan banks operate and doctors, teachers, engineers and other workers are paid to prevent the country’s economic collapse. The issue of recognition of the Taliban government is up to member states, Guterres said, but the U.N. has been pressing the Taliban, which took power in August as U.S.-led NATO forces were departing after 20 years, to ensure human rights, especially women’s rights to work and girls’ education, and to make the government more inclusive and reflective of Afghanistan’s diverse population. The secretary-general said he will be attending the Beijing Olympics in February “which is not a political act” but “to be present when all the world comes together for good — for a peaceful message.”"
