1,Group Who Interrupted Drag Reading Event Investigated For Possible Hate Crime,social-justice," SAN LORENZO, Calif. (AP) — Authorities were investigating a possible hate crime after a group of men allegedly shouted homophobic and anti-LGBTQ slurs during a Drag Queen Story Hour at a San Francisco Bay Area library, a sheriff’s official said. Deputies responded to the San Lorenzo Library Saturday afternoon following reports of a disturbance during the reading for preschool-aged children in celebration of Pride Month, said Lt. Ray Kelly with the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. The host of the children’s story program, Bay Area drag queen Panda Dulce, said on Instagram that the group disrupted the event, shouting “tranny” and “pedophile.” The disruption “totally freaked out all of the kids” and the group “attempted to escalate to violence,” he wrote. No arrests have been made, no one was physically harmed, and sheriff’s officials are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime and harassment of children, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “It appears the group of men may be affiliated with the Proud Boys organization,” said Kelly, adding that the five men involved were wearing the black and yellow colors associated with the far-right group. Kelly said the sheriff’s office plans to post deputies at future story-hour events at the library “to deal with any disruptors.” The incident was first reported by KQED. In Idaho, more than two dozen members of a white supremacist group were arrested near a pride event. Police say the 31 Patriot Front members had riot gear and were seen loading people into a U-Haul at a hotel parking lot in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Among those arrested was Thomas Rousseau of Grapevine, Texas, who has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the 23-year-old who founded the group."
2,"Facebook Fails, Again, To Detect Explicit Hate Speech In Ads",social-justice," SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The test couldn’t have been much easier — and Facebook still failed. Facebook and its parent company Meta flopped once again in a test of how well they could detect obviously violent hate speech in advertisements submitted to the platform by the nonprofit groups Global Witness and Foxglove. The hateful messages focused on Ethiopia, where internal documents obtained by whistleblower Frances Haugen showed that Facebook’s ineffective moderation is “literally fanning ethnic violence,” as she said in her 2021 congressional testimony. In March, Global Witness ran a similar test with hate speech in Myanmar, which Facebook also failed to detect. The group created 12 text-based ads that used dehumanizing hate speech to call for the murder of people belonging to each of Ethiopia’s three main ethnic groups — the Amhara, the Oromo and the Tigrayans. Facebook’s systems approved the ads for publication, just as they did with the Myanmar ads. The ads were not actually published on Facebook. This time around, though, the group informed Meta about the undetected violations. The company said the ads shouldn’t have been approved and pointed to the work it has done “building our capacity to catch hateful and inflammatory content in the most widely spoken languages, including Amharic.” A week after hearing from Meta, Global Witness submitted two more ads for approval, again with blatant hate speech. The two ads, again in written text in Amharic, the most widely used language in Ethiopia, were approved. Meta did not respond to multiple messages for comment this week. “When ads calling for genocide in Ethiopia repeatedly get through Facebook’s net — even after the issue is flagged with Facebook — there’s only one possible conclusion: there’s nobody home.” “We picked out the worst cases we could think of,” said Rosie Sharpe, a campaigner at Global Witness. “The ones that ought to be the easiest for Facebook to detect. They weren’t coded language. They weren’t dog whistles. They were explicit statements saying that this type of person is not a human or these type of people should be starved to death.” Meta has consistently refused to say how many content moderators it has in countries where English is not the primary language. This includes moderators in Ethiopia, Myanmar and other regions where material posted on the company’s platforms has been linked to real-world violence. In November, Meta said it removed a post by Ethiopia’s prime minister that urged citizens to rise up and “bury” rival Tigray forces who threatened the country’s capital. In the since-deleted post, Abiy said the “obligation to die for Ethiopia belongs to all of us.” He called on citizens to mobilize “by holding any weapon or capacity.” Abiy has continued to post on the platform, though, where he has 4.1 million followers. The U.S. and others have warned Ethiopia about “dehumanizing rhetoric” after the prime minister described the Tigray forces as “cancer” and “weeds” in comments made in July 2021. “When ads calling for genocide in Ethiopia repeatedly get through Facebook’s net — even after the issue is flagged with Facebook — there’s only one possible conclusion: there’s nobody home,” said Rosa Curling, director of Foxglove, a London-based legal nonprofit that partnered with Global Witness in its investigation. “Years after the Myanmar genocide, it is clear Facebook hasn’t learned its lesson.”"
3,A Conservative Tennessee Prosecutor’s Tough-On-Crime Approach Excludes Police,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter When Shelby County’s top prosecutor, Amy Weirich, was running for reelection in 2014, she declared, “I don’t apologize for being tough on crime.” In the years that followed, she lived up to that pledge. Over a long tenure as the top law enforcement official in a large Tennessee county that includes Memphis, Weirich has aggressively pursued violent and petty crime cases and cast herself as an unabashedly pro-police district attorney. Her office declined to bring charges against police officers who shot or killed people in Shelby County. It disproportionately locked up Black people, who make up 54% of Shelby County’s population and 85% of the people in the county’s jails. The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed multiple convictions secured by her office, and Harvard Law’s Fair Punishment Project found she engaged in more prosecutorial misconduct than any other district attorney in Tennessee. This fall, Weirich, a Republican, will face voters in this Democratic-leaning county for the first time in eight years. The election will be a referendum on her tough-on-crime agenda: Her Democratic opponent, Steven Mulroy, has advocated for a shift in Memphis’ criminal justice system and supports reform efforts such as establishing units to review prison sentences. It’s not just a question of philosophies. In 2020, Memphis reached its highest homicide total on record. The city broke that record again last year. Spikes in violent crime have vastly complicated the politics around criminal justice, and often the crime rate has been used as a cudgel against progressive, reform-minded prosecutors. This was shown true after San Francisco voters elected to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, one of the country’s most progressive top prosecutors. Boudin’s effort was centered around reforming the city’s criminal justice system, including actions such as ending cash bail and stopping the prosecution of minors as adults ― along with being the first DA in the city’s history to file homicide charges against police officers. Weirich sells herself as being tough on crime, but how will voters react when the crime rate has gone up anyway? HuffPost talked with former prosecutors who worked under Weirich, as well as attorneys for people shot by police. They described a prosecutor who was relentless in her efforts to crack down on crime but absolved the police of accountability: A leader whose approach drove down office morale. And they described how Shelby County and Memphis ― a majority-Black city that’s long suffered from poverty, sparse funding for education and a lack of economic opportunity for its Black residents ― have been hurt by her ruthless approach. Police in Shelby County have shot and killed 20 people during Weirich’s 11-year run as the county’s top prosecutor, but her office has not prosecuted a single one. A former prosecutor who worked in the Shelby County DA’s office and asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional consequences said an officer in the county who shot a person would not be “charged unless there are 100 witnesses and someone on video.” Pamela Fleming, who also worked under Weirich, said protecting police was part of the culture. “If you believe the police can be corrupt, we don’t know how you can be a prosecutor,” Fleming recalled higher-ups telling her during the decade she spent as a district attorney in the office. Weirich denied Fleming’s account in an interview with HuffPost, and pointed out that her office has prosecuted police for cases such as driving while under the influence, kidnapping and rape. But the office’s record on police shootings is clear: Officers have never been indicted ― let alone convicted ― in Memphis for fatally or non-fatally shooting civilians. Weirich’s office recommended charges against an officer in only one case, but the officer was never criminally charged. In the other cases, officers who violated department policy were not criminally held accountable. This is what happened in the case of Martavious Banks. A police officer critically injured Banks, who is Black, during a traffic stop in 2018. After police pulled Banks over, he told them he had no license or insurance and was driving his mother’s car. Banks drove away, but struck a curb within half a mile and got out of the car. Police said they saw a gun in the vehicle and that Banks reached down. Although a gun was found with Banks’ blood on it after the shooting, there was no indication Banks had threatened officers during the encounter. Banks attempted to flee into his house, according to police, and made it to the front porch when then-Memphis cop Jemarcus Jeames shot him five times. There’s no footage of the shooting. Only moments before it happened, the three officers on the scene turned off their body cameras, which was a violation of department policy. None of the officers were charged with a crime, although activists called for charges of attempted murder or assault with intent to commit a murder. Jeames resigned from the department, and the two other officers were disciplined with unpaid leave. Memphis lawmakers proposed that intentionally turning off a body camera and obstructing justice should be a felony violation, but the law never passed. Banks survived the shooting but wound up in jail. Weirich’s office charged him with evading arrest, reckless driving, having a revoked license and unlawful possession of a weapon due to a gun recovered inside his home. He was jailed for 11 months. After a plea agreement, Banks was released from jail on two years and 10 months probation. Banks sued the police department over the shooting, seeking $10 million for damages. He received a total of $200,000 in a settlement. Banks’ lawyer, Arthur Horne, said Jeames should have faced criminal prosecution. “Nationally, we have started to see more and more cases where cops are being prosecuted for being rogue officers,” Horne said. “Unfortunately, we have never had that here in Shelby County and can’t under Weirich’s administration. Her mantra is being tough on crime. It applies to people in this community, but it doesn’t apply to law enforcement.” Weirich said that Jeames acted “within the law” of the state of Tennessee even though he violated police department policy by turning off his camera. “If cops are killing people in self-defense or in defense of others, they have the legal right to do that. And I am not going to prosecute people who have not broke(n) the law.” When Weirich’s office attempted to bring charges against one police officer who fatally shot a civilian, a grand jury opted not to indict the officer. In 2015, Memphis police officer Connor Schilling shot and killed an unarmed 19-year-old named Darrius Stewart. Schilling stopped a car over a broken headlight. He said he saw that Stewart, who was a passenger in the vehicle, had multiple warrants for his arrest so he put him in the back of the police car. Schilling claimed that Stewart attacked him while sitting in the squad car and struck him with his handcuffs. A cellphone video from a witness showed the two struggling from the back of the patrol car to the ground. Schilling claimed he shot Stewart in self-defense, but an investigation conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations concluded Stewart was running away when Schilling shot him. Weirich’s office recommended involuntary manslaughter charges, but a grand jury decided not to indict Schilling. Federal authorities determined a year after the shooting that there was not enough evidence to conclude that Schilling had used unnecessary lethal force. Weirich has not looked to reopen the case. “The Darrius Stewart case was presented to the grand jury, I prepared an indictment, asked the case officer as I do in tens and thousands of cases, and the grand jury said no,” she said. Stewart’s family believes Weirich could have done more. The family filed a $17 million lawsuit against Schilling in 2020 and called for the case to be reopened. The lawsuit is still ongoing. “The general consensus is that you can indict a ham sandwich. When it comes to indicting officers, Amy [Weirich] can never seem to get it right,” Carlos Moore, an attorney for Stewart’s family, told HuffPost. “Compare her other indictments to what she does with cops who harm Black men, you would see a drastic difference.” Weirich defended her record in police violence cases and suggested her state’s laws made it difficult to obtain convictions or even indictments. Tennessee laws allow officers to use deadly force against someone who is fleeing or an “immediately dangerous felon.” Another former prosecutor who worked under Weirich and who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, said the office appeared to take a soft approach to police because they often had to work closely together. “[I] still don’t think that prevents you from being critical about police work and certain officers who have a record of not being credible or having certain behavior,” the former prosecutor said. Weirich has a far tougher approach when dealing with everyone else. She supports “truth in sentencing” laws, which require people convicted of a number of felonies to serve their full sentence without the possibility of receiving parole due to good behavior. In recent weeks, she doubled down on her support for “truth in sentencing” laws and has gone after Mulroy for not supporting them. “Make no mistake, this election is a clear choice between a DA who will fight for victims or a radical activist who sued our Sheriff to release prisoners from jail,” Weirich stated. “In many times, the system is not tough enough on violent offenders. They are sentenced to x amount of years and they are back on the streets.” Weirich’s rigid approach to crime was always a part of the office culture ― which at times has roiled her staff, according to conversations with four former employees. More than one of the interviewed prosecutors described her mentality as “dated,” and others said her approach to the city’s criminal justice system has been more or less a failure. Her office does not have an in-house unit to review its convictions and investigate claims of wrongful convictions. Such units have been established in more progressive district attorney offices throughout the country and have typically caused more good than harm in reviewing sentences. One of the former prosecutors said that Weirich told them “our entire office is” a conviction review unit. She has also spoken publicly against establishing such a unit in her office. But a prosecutor’s mentality is often different from one a review unit could provide, one prosecutor told HuffPost. “That mentality of ‘I’m not a social worker and I’m just here to prosecute this case,’ that mentality is not productive if you expect to change a culture of crime that we have here in Memphis,” the prosecutor said. “It is just not.” Prosecutors are also overworked. In 2018, the Prosecutor’s Center for Excellence, a policy group tasked with advising prosecutor offices in the country, found that many of the prosecutors in Weirich’s office were taking on too many cases to be able to do their jobs successfully. Weirich acknowledged the high caseload puts a strain on staff. “When you look at workload and caseload, we don’t have the amount of people that we need and we have no control of what comes through the door,” she said. “But, the DA office can’t say that. If a crime is committed and someone is arrested, we have to act.” Fleming said morale in the office has hit an “all-time low” during Weirich’s tenure. “The way she runs her office, it is about whatever is best for her image and making sure things do not cause discomfort for her,” Fleming said. “She talks, and gets photos-ops, but makes sure no one is making a stink. She does not care about what she does to her prosecutors on staff, it’s all about what will be in the paper.” Shelby County residents, particularly Black ones, are suffering most. The Justice Department investigated Shelby County’s juvenile court in 2018 and found that a majority of kids transferred to adult facilities were Black. The department’s report described Weirich tactics ― such as pushing for stiff sentencing on youth, aggressively prosecuting low-level crimes and not acknowledging youth mental illness ― as a “toxic combination for African-American youth.” “In Shelby County, this is only the most recent and high profile examples of how Weirich inflicts devastating harm among Black Memphians and their communities,” the letter reads. Local criminal justice advocates say Weirich’s office discriminates against Black people, citing poor diversity in the office and the high numbers of Black people in local prisons and jails. They have called for a racial equity audit of Weirich’s office, something at least two Shelby County Commissioners support. Mulroy, who is running against Weirich, called out the diversity in her office, claiming he had reviewed data and interviewed former employees to determine that only 30% of staff and 10% of attorneys in the office were Black. Mulroy said he obtained the data from the county and from interviews with former employees of the DA’s office. Weirich pushed back, calling Mulroy’s data “false” and “hypocritical.” In an interview with local Memphis television station Action News 5, Weirich said there are “more minorities” in supervisory positions in “our office right now than ever before.” Josh Spickler, a criminal justice advocate in Memphis who helped write the letter demanding an audit, was outspoken against Weirich’s handling of the case of Pamela Moses, a Black woman who was prosecuted for illegal voting when she attempted to register to vote despite being unaware that she was ineligible due to a prior felony conviction. She was initially sentenced to six years in prison until Weirich dropped the charges. Spickler told HuffPost that Moses never should have been charged and that Weirich’s actions were evidence of her overzealous pursuit to send people to jail. “Where in our society does this make any type of sense?” he said. “This was a Republican white DA prosecuting, in an election year, a Black woman who attempted to vote. It reeked of systemic and institutional racism and voter suppression and racism.” Weirich’s harsh approach never slowed down homicides in Memphis. In 2019, the city had the ninth highest murder rate in the nation. In 2020, Memphis set a grim record for homicides with 332 murders. The city’s totals increased again to 346 homicides last year, setting a new record in the city. But one of the former prosecutors said Weirich’s tough-on-crime model has ultimately been at the city’s expense. “The hard on crime mentality that you hear her say that people just want to be ‘soft on crime,’ the mentality she has mentioned since she has been in office, what has improved in our city crime wise?” the former prosecutor said. “Not a whole lot. None, nothing at all.” Social Justice Reporter"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what?

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"South African Pastor Found Guilty Of Treason, Racist Plot",social-justice," JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A South African court has convicted a pastor of plotting to overthrow the government and to kill thousands of Black people in the country. Harry Johannes Knoesen, 61, a leader of the National Christian Resistance Movement, was on Monday found guilty of high treason, incitement to carry out violent attacks, and recruiting people to commit attacks. Knoesen’s group explored the possibility of using a biological weapon to infect and kill Black people, including the poisoning of water reservoirs supplying Black communities, according to the prosecution. Knoesen was also found guilty of unlawful possession of firearms by the Middelburg High Court. Weapons and ammunition were found when he was arrested in Middelburg, a small town in the eastern Mpumalanga province. The plot by the pastor’s group was foiled in 2019 by South Africa’s police and intelligence services, who have since dismantled the organization’s cells across various parts of the country and arrested some of its leaders. Knoesen was convicted on evidence from witnesses including members of his group who are already serving jail sentences after they were convicted of similar crimes. The state alleged that Knoesen’s plot was motivated by his “highly racial views” and that he sought to justify his beliefs on religious grounds, claiming that he was ordained to “reclaim South Africa for white people.” “To further this end, he planned to attack government institutions and more specifically police and military institutions,” Monica Nyuswa, a spokeswoman for the National Prosecuting Authority, told The Associated Press. He also identified townships and informal settlements occupied by Black South Africans as targets for attack, she said. Knoesen allegedly used social media platform Facebook to incite violence against Black people and to recruit former members of South Africa’s military to join his movement and to carry out the planned attacks. These were foiled when he was arrested in November 2019 and the cells in various parts of the country were dismantled. In his testimony, Knoesen admitted to sharing “recipes” to manufacture explosives with his followers on Facebook, according to the Middelburg Observer newspaper. This is not the first racist, treasonous plot to be uncovered in South Africa. In 2013, 20 members of the right-wing white supremacy group known as the Boeremag were sentenced to prison for plotting to kill South Africa’s first Black president Nelson Mandela, overthrow the government and kill thousands of Black people. They were handed sentences ranging from five to 35 years following a 10-year treason trial, one of the longest in the country’s history. That group, like Knoesen’s, was opposed to South Africa’s democracy which brought an end to apartheid, the country’s regime of white minority rule that ended with the first democratic elections in 1994 which elected Mandela president. Knoesen is expected back in court on June 10 for the beginning of sentencing proceedings."

12,Tucker Carlson Mocks BTS For Speaking Out Against Anti-Asian Hate Crimes,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson seems to have something against a popular Korean boy band combining forces with the White House to denounce anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S. The Fox News host mocked the Biden administration and BTS Tuesday after the K-pop mega stars, who have millions of fans in the U.S. and around the world, appeared at the White House to raise awareness and speak out about the rise in hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans in recent years. “Things have gotten very bad for Joe Biden, both public-facing and internally. What are they doing about it? Well, they broke glass in case of emergency and invited a Korean pop group to speak at the White House today,” Carlson said, airing footage from the appearance. “Yeah, so we got a Korean pop group to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States. Okay. Good job, guys.” The Biden administration has been working to address the surge in violence against Asian Americans since last year. In May 2021, the president signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law, after a white shooter killed eight people — including six Asian women — at a massage spa in Georgia in March. Carlson’s show was named “what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news” in a recent New York Times investigation about how the Fox News host stoked white fears and division and channeled it into ratings over the years. He has directed his vitriol at immigrants and people of color across the board. In 2020, when advocates warned that former President Donald Trump’s racist names for the coronavirus were stoking anti-Asian hate, Carlson defended the president for doing so.

14,My Father Was My Gateway To American Life. Then I Found Out He Lied To Get Into This Country.,social-justice," Guest Writer The one thing I thought I knew for certain was that my Chinese father, Mow Lim, was allowed to immigrate in the 1940s because my grandfather was a U.S. citizen. I never questioned that fact or found out how Grandfather Sam, himself an immigrant, earned his citizenship. Nor could I ask my father these questions. He was killed in a plane crash in 1964, when I was 7. I adored my father and loved the stories my mother told me. He arrived on a steamship alone when he was 12, then moved from San Francisco to Tulare in the Central Valley in his teens. Butchering in a meat market during the day, he rode a bicycle to night school to learn English. He adopted the American name “Don” and, at 19, served in the U.S. Army in World War II. On a visit to China, he was matched to my mother. After they married, they had five children and he entered the grocery business. Before his death at 36, he owned a store in Castroville, California, and had a share of a larger one in Salinas. His photos in our albums comforted me for years after his death. He looked handsome and debonair with his arched eyebrows and easy smile. My eyes were always drawn to the picture of him in his teens, with a white T-shirt and rolled-up chinos. He had been my gateway to American life. He bought my sister a portable record player and dozens of 45s, and we listened to Barbara Lewis’ “Hello Stranger” and Lesley Gore’s “It’s My Party” long after his death. He enrolled us in music and dance lessons. On his rare days off, he took us to the Santa Cruz boardwalk or to Pacific Grove to collect shells. As the baby in the family, I got to sit on his lap in the evening and I would try to synchronize my breathing with his. After his death, my widowed mother was left with five children, aged 7 to 15, two grocery businesses and limited English. Cantonese became the primary language at home and Chinese instrumental music replaced the soundtrack to “Oklahoma” on the stereo. I wasn’t interested in my native culture. I wanted meatloaf with mashed potatoes or Taco Bell instead of the ground pork with salted fish and spare ribs with black bean sauce my grandmother made. I longed to go to summer camp and learn to canoe or vacation in Cape Cod and eat blueberries straight off the vines like the girls I read about in the books at the public library. Instead, my childhood and adolescence were spent working at the grocery store. “Are you going to marry Chinese?” my grandmother used to ask me. I always said yes because I wanted a partner who saw the importance of family, of saving face and being modest. In college, I met my Jewish boyfriend who embodied those traits and valued me. We married and settled in Los Angeles, where I pursued a career in social work and education. We raised two sons who were proud of their mixed heritage. I was confident of my citizenship and place in this country. It wasn’t until 2017 that I researched our history and realized how little I knew about my father’s life before he came to America. He’d left China during the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned the entry of laborers from 1882 to 1943. It was the only piece of legislation that barred a specific ethnic group from entering this nation and from becoming naturalized citizens. There was an exemption for sons of native-born U.S. citizens. Was that how my father was able to come? Some Chinese evaded the ban by claiming to be sons of native-born citizens. Men would testify that they were born in the U.S. and then provide witnesses affirming that fact. Once declared citizens by the government, they’d visit China, then report the birth of sons when they came back. Those offspring were eligible to immigrate due to birthright citizenship. Thousands of Chinese entered the U.S. during the exclusion act using false papers. They were called “paper sons.” In 1906, all birth records in San Francisco burned in fires after the earthquake, leading to a flood of false papers. Chinese already in the U.S. declared under oath that they were born here and had sons in China. We knew of families with “paper” names and real clan names and brothers with different last names because of assumed identities. But I didn’t think that was the case with my father or grandfather. What I found at the National Archives in San Bruno proved otherwise. My father’s case file contained transcripts and photos that documented his arrival. He was detained for 43 days before being interviewed by three inspectors. Barely 14 at the time, with cheeks still chubby with baby fat, they asked him 155 questions about his kinship and village life, trying to catch him in a lie. “Were your paternal grandmother’s feet ever bound?” “Has your village a fish pond?” “Were the tables and chairs the property of the school or individuals?” The interrogation took two days, each question and answer translated through an interpreter. There were some lies in his testimony. He said that his grandfather, my great-grandfather, was born in the United States, but I knew that wasn’t true. The grandfather was really his great-uncle Ock Jit, born in the Guangdong province, according to relatives. I requested files for Grandfather Sam, as well as Ock Jit, from the National Archives, where I discovered our clan’s path to the United States. In 1894, Ock Jit arrived in San Francisco via steamship. Wearing a black skull cap and black shirt, he told authorities he’d been born in Chinatown but went back to Guangdong for a visit and was now re-entering. He was detained but filed a writ of habeas corpus with the federal courts. His testimony, and that of two witnesses, convinced the judge he was from San Francisco and he was declared a native-born citizen. In subsequent visits to China, he returned to San Francisco and declared the birth of sons (one was my grandfather though he was really a nephew). Ock Jit had one son but said he had four. In total, seven men were let into America as his sons and grandsons. Reading their files made me uneasy. Their claim to citizenship was based on a lie. Were they “illegal immigrants”? Did that mean I wasn’t a true American? After the 2016 presidential election, the new administration railed against foreigners, documented and undocumented. There was talk of a Muslim ban. Would Chinese be singled out again? Would our status as citizens undergo scrutiny after the fact? But as I studied the story Ock Jit’s descendants told when they arrived, I couldn’t fault them for lying. Like all immigrants, they were seeking a better life for themselves and future generations. I was impressed by how they educated themselves on the exemptions in the exclusion act and used the government’s legal processes in their favor. They retained white attorneys knowledgeable of the judicial system to file the necessary paperwork for hearings. They took their cases to federal courts. I wondered if my father had any qualms about the deception. For many that entered during the exclusion era, there were fears of deportation if real relationships or names were revealed. My brother remembered my parents hiding the Chinese writing on a framed picture in case there was a surprise inspection from immigration. Fears of intimidation lurked in my mind with the rise of anti-Asian sentiment during the onset of COVID. Nearly a third of Asian-Americans in the San Gabriel Valley experienced hate during the pandemic, according to the LA Times. I thought back to what my ancestors did in the face of harsher times when they were clearly not welcomed here. I felt renewed gratitude for their efforts and reminded myself that this was my home. This was where I was born. And I am a true American.

15,Here's What No One Told Me About Trying To Learn English As An Adult,social-justice," Guest Writer I am 49 years old. Three years ago, I didn’t know who Frank Sinatra was. About a year ago, I finally realized I actually knew the character of Sherlock Holmes. In March, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins died. I had no idea who he was. I did not recently come out of a cave. I am a Chinese immigrant who came to this country at age 32. I teach public speaking and interpersonal communication at San Jose State University. Today, I consume 99% of the news in English. After years of being in America, I can express myself freely in my second language, even laughing at “SNL” jokes like Osh Kosh F’gosh on baby clothes. Still, when I first encountered the name Frank Sinatra, I was in an MFA workshop reading Gay Talese’s “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold.” Unlike everyone else in the room, I had no grasp of the singer’s cultural significance. We can’t separate language from culture, but a chasm separates language and cultural knowledge. The very first thing many immigrants notice upon arriving in the U.S. is a sudden loss of a free tongue, the ease of expression, along with the loss of mainstream cultural references, which is ironic considering the U.S. has the largest immigrant population in the world. U.K. publishing house Collins says that shared cultural references bond a language’s native speakers. The references can be to a country’s historic events or arise from the news of the day. Those of us who don’t speak English from birth (I call us multilingual speakers or English learners instead of nonnative speakers) are excluded, at least for a long stretch of time, from the conversation. The word “mainstream” implies exclusion, implies the division between a norm and an exotic. I came to this country with limited English proficiency. Obviously, language was the first reason that I didn’t understand many cultural references, a steep contrast to my ability to swim freely back in my old pond as a radio host in China. Being in the media most of my life, I wanted a sense of normalcy, which was a simple desire to understand. My feeling has been one of constant catching up, an effort to reach some vague idea of mainstream. I soon realized it was mostly one-sided: The mainstream did not care if I joined or not. I started ESL in community colleges with many other immigrants from diverse linguistic backgrounds, trying to conquer English, while in fact, we were all trying to figure out America. We immigrants work hard to get around. It’s our job to climb this mountain. The mountain is high and inflexible. The older we are to arrive to this country, the more likely we are to feel disoriented and disconnected from the popular TV shows, books and topics the mainstream talks about. We are like kids moving to a new school, suddenly isolated when everyone arounds us talks about things we don’t understand. Some references are unknown to me only because of the translation barrier. I didn’t know Sherlock Holmes in Chinese is 福尔摩斯. I knew 福尔摩斯 all along but not Sherlock Holmes. Similar to historic figures and names, in geography, I sometimes cannot match the countries with my knowledge of them in Chinese. The first time I talked to a Bangladeshi student, I realized too late, that Bangladesh was 孟加拉国 in my language. I knew it, but, at the same time, I didn’t know it. I was ashamed. I will never forget that one day in a public speaking class I was teaching when a student requested to sit down to give his speech. “I just had a ‘brownie,’ you know?” The entire class laughed except for me. He meant a marijuana brownie. How would I have known? I went to school counseling after the class because I thought I was being laughed at. I don’t think the reality was too far away from what I thought. This brownie moment happened when I was a new instructor, freshly graduated with my master’s in communication studies, as well as a serious grader during a quick speech exercise. I could not find a way to be. This fish suddenly lost her ability to swim. After 17 years in the country, now I am at a point in my life where I’m no longer afraid of embarrassment. I can even make fun of myself. If the brownie moment presented itself to me today, I would have laughed along with my students, and asked, “What does it taste like?” But that laughter from years ago has been ingrained in my journey of English ― the loss in the sea. The road is bumpy for older immigrants working to learn both English and mainstream references, but my eagerness to learn helps me make sense of many cultural ideas. Being a radio person, I naturally picked up the habit of listening to NPR, whether I understood it or not. At first, my days were filled with words I did not know. Being a pond fish at sea, I did the only thing I knew how to do: I swam. When I didn’t understand something, I Googled it. I am still doing that today. Like right at this moment, I need to express this thing in my mind that I can only put it in a Chinese idiom, 积小成多, a cultural idea in my language. So, I looked it up in English. Now a new phrase, “many a little makes a mickle,” is part of my lexicon. It can be so odd when newfound words are introduced into my writing and used to tell my story. Those new words are like me ― always out of place. My husband, an immigrant from Italy, came to the U.S. years before me and is a fan of many American classics. It was because of him that I watched the entire “Seinfeld” series (and on repeat) and “SNL” each week. He and I also share an affection for ’80s songs. I listened to these same songs back in China when I didn’t know much about the lyrics, but now newfound meanings add to some existing familiarity. An Italian man and a Chinese woman listening to American classics in America. Isn’t this household a microcosm of this country? We blend together in this unique place we call America. As an immigrant, I explain myself very often in writing and everyday interactions, knowing the mainstream won’t get my cultural references if I don’t spend the extra two minutes or the extra two paragraphs to make myself clear. I do that so my “exotic” cultural experience somehow becomes acceptable. Mainstream media is a powerful current working its force over me, nudging me to become the same fish like everyone else. I realize I’ve been trying to swim against the stream but still want to be part of the American conversation. The day of I first heard of Frank Sinatra, my MFA classmates did not give me a look of “What? You don’t know who Sinatra is?” They just simply continued to carry on the discussion. And during those conversations, I learned about the singer and his baritone voice and I found a new fascination. I wonder if it was because my classmates did not react negatively to me on that day that perhaps I was saved. I wanted to keep learning instead of feeling left out or less than the others because of what I didn’t know. Those writers became friends and will remain my friends for life. I try to understand what it means, but there’s no need to overthink it. This fish from different waters felt normal that day. It’s only when we are ridiculed do we see ourselves as small and incompetent. It’s only when the fish is reminded she is different that she becomes self-conscious and doesn’t know how to swim. If you are the fish in the mainstream, please teach me, and if you can, teach me with a smile. If I know that learning from you is free of mockery but full of adventure, I will swim alongside you, and I may even tell you about all of the great things in my old pond. Maybe that way we can all be a part of redefining and shaping the mainstream. Maybe we can make something beautiful together.

0,Judge: COVID Asylum Restrictions Must Continue On Border,social-justice," LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) — Pandemic-related restrictions on migrants seeking asylum on the southern border must continue, a judge ruled Friday in an order blocking the Biden administration’s plan to lift them early next week. The ruling is just the latest instance of a court derailing the president’s proposed immigration policies along the U.S. border with Mexico. While the administration can appeal, the ruling sharply increases the odds that restrictions will not end as planned on Monday. A delay would be a blow to advocates who say rights to seek asylum are being trampled, and a relief to some Democrats who fear that a widely anticipated increase in illegal crossings would put them on the defensive in an already difficult midterm election year. Migrants have been expelled more than 1.9 million times since March 2020 under Title 42, a public health provision that denies them a chance to request asylum under U.S. law and international treaty on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Lafayette, Louisiana, ordered that the restrictions stay in place while a lawsuit led by Arizona and Louisiana — and now joined by 22 other states — plays out in court. The states argued that the administration failed to adequately consider the effects that lifting the restrictions would have on public health and law enforcement. Drew Ensign, an attorney for the state of Arizona, argued at a hearing that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed to follow administrative procedures requiring public notice and time to gather public comment. Jean Lin, a Justice Department attorney, told the judge that the CDC was empowered to lift an emergency health restriction it felt was no longer needed. She said the order was a matter of health policy, not immigration. Summerhays, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, had already ruled in favor of the states by halting efforts to wind down use of the pandemic-era rule. He said last month that a phaseout would saddle states with “unrecoverable costs on healthcare, law enforcement, detention, education, and other services.” Title 42 is the second major Trump-era policy to deter asylum at the Mexican border that was jettisoned by President Joe Biden, only to be revived by a Trump-appointed judge. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to allow the administration to force asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. That case, challenging a policy known as “Remain in Mexico,” originated in Amarillo, Texas. It was reinstated in December on the judge’s order and remains in effect while the litigation plays out.

3,California Church Shooting Was 'Politically Motivated Hate' Crime: Sheriff,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The suspected gunman who opened fire in a church in Orange County, California, on Sunday — killing one person and injuring five others — is a Chinese American man believed to have targeted the Taiwanese congregants in a “politically motivated hate incident,” per the Orange Country sheriff. The suspect, 68-year-old David Chou, was a Chinese immigrant and U.S. citizen who “specifically targeted the Taiwanese community” when he traveled from Las Vegas to the Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods and shot Taiwanese Presbyterian churchgoers during a luncheon, Sheriff Don Barnes said at a press conference Monday. “Based on the information we’ve collected, it was a politically motivated hate incident,” Barnes said, adding that authorities believe the suspect was “upset about political tensions between China and Taiwan,” and targeted the parishioners based on their nationality. On Sunday, about 50 members of the Taiwanese Presbyterian Church were having a lunch banquet when the suspect arrived, secured the church doors with chains, superglued the locks and began shooting at parishioners. He killed Dr. John Cheng, 52, who leaves behind a wife and two kids, per the sheriff’s office. The five wounded were age 66 to 92. Barnes said Cheng was a “hero” who charged the shooter before being shot dead. Others threw a chair at the shooter, then tied his legs with extension cords until law enforcement arrived. Deputies arrived within minutes and took the suspect into custody, the sheriff said. The suspect was booked on one count of felony murder and five of attempted murder. Law enforcement recovered two handguns at the scene and found several bags of ammo, as well as four Molotov cocktail-like devices the suspect placed inside the church. The suspect had no known connection to the church, and had been living in the U.S. for years, most recently working as a security guard in Las Vegas. The FBI has opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the shooter, a field office spokesperson said at Monday’s press conference. “There’s just no place for hate in this country anymore, whether it’s racially based hate, religiously based, national origin,” Barnes said Monday. “This is a manifestation of the ugliest part of our humanity that exists in our country today.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"For This Child Of Immigrants, Pop Culture Became A Guide To Life In America",social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost This is part of This Made Me, a HuffPost series paying tribute to the formative pop culture in our lives. Read more stories from the series here. The first time I heard about Simon & Garfunkel was on an episode of “Arthur.” Art Garfunkel — or the cartoon moose version of him — was walking around Ellwood City, singing “The Ballad of Buster Baxter.” It wasn’t until a few years later, watching “The Graduate,” that I realized that he was half of one of the most influential musical duos of the 20th century. As the only child of immigrants, “Arthur” and other PBS shows enabled my first foray into American pop culture — and in the process, my first attempts at figuring out what it even means to be American. Without a baseline of cultural references acquired from my parents, I unknowingly (and later knowingly) started to cobble together my own pop culture reference points, acquiring my own mental library of formative movies, television, books and music. It’s a process that continues today in my professional life as a culture reporter and writer. In my teens, I thought becoming a cinephile would help me become more sophisticated and cosmopolitan. So I checked out VHS tapes and DVDs of Oscar-winning and nominated films from my local library, perused IMDb message boards and film blogs, and read about “auteur directors” (almost all of whom were white men). On TV, I watched a lot of sitcoms, admiring the density of the jokes and topical references on “The Office,” “Arrested Development,” and “30 Rock.” The latter was especially formative. I saw a lot of myself in Liz Lemon: nerdy, bespectacled, and deeply committed to and successful at her job as a writer (and not so successful romantically or socially). During the same period, I also started to become a writer — and once again, had to teach myself a lot of things. I collected memorable figures of speech, expressions and turns of phrase, filing them away in my brain (and later, in a Google Doc). I had a lot of trouble figuring out which prepositions went with which turns of phrase and discovered expressions that I was using wrong because I had misremembered them. Whenever I used an expression, I would Google it and triple-check to make sure I wasn’t misusing it. Is it “cut and dry” or “cut and dried”? What’s a “ballpark figure”? How do you “call an audible”? Why are there so many sports metaphors? I felt like I had to be overprepared and extra thorough in order to make up for what I didn’t know and stake my claim as a writer, a profession I assumed I couldn’t enter because I didn’t know anyone who looked like me doing it. Being a child of immigrants is like playing a game of telephone your entire life. There are so many references I’ve misheard or only half-learned, concepts that I only vaguely understand or have retained in some modified way. I feel like I have secondhand or even thirdhand knowledge of “American culture” because I had to learn it myself. At the same time, I also have second or thirdhand knowledge of my parents’ Chinese culture because there was only so much they could replicate or pass down. I spent a lot of time writing about this bifurcated existence in my journals and in essays, trying to articulate what it was, but failing to find the right words. I wondered whether I was doing all of this “correctly,” as if there was one “correct” way to do all of this, or one “correct” definition of “American pop culture.” Throughout my childhood, I could sense that my parents also struggled with these questions: What is “American culture”? What does it mean to be American? They, too, tried to teach themselves aspects of pop culture. We developed a ritual of watching the evening news each night, followed by “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune.” My dad subscribed to whatever newspapers and magazines we could afford: our local paper, Time and Newsweek. Sometimes, he would buy the Sunday New York Times, and when I was a teen, he indulged my budding interest in movies and TV by paying for my subscription to Entertainment Weekly. Sometimes, we would watch those library VHS tapes or DVDs together. Or, I’d convince them to drive me to the only indie theater in town to watch that year’s Oscar contenders. A month or two later, we’d tune in to the Oscars to see if the movies we had managed to see won any awards. But there was something missing here. My process of acquiring pop culture for myself didn’t always feel authentic and didn’t always feel like me. It’s like I was trying things on for size. Sometimes, I felt like I was going off of what I was expected to like, or letting other people’s tastes determine my own. Many of those tastes, many of those definitions of what was “great,” what was “the best,” what was “the most influential,” were shaped by people who did not look like me. And many of the things I found formative did not center on people who looked like me, even in work that I loved dearly. “In my teens, I thought becoming a cinephile would help me become more sophisticated and cosmopolitan. So I checked out VHS tapes and DVDs of Oscar-winning and nominated films from my local library, perused IMDb message boards and film blogs, and read about 'auteur directors' (almost all of whom were white men).” Now, as a culture journalist, I often get to cover people who likely had to go through a similar process of acquiring pop culture on their own and didn’t often see themselves represented in that work. But now, they’re reshaping and transforming the culture. They’re taking existing genres like the sitcom and making them their own. They’re becoming auteur directors and directing award-winning movies. I got to tell Lulu Wang how much “The Farewell” meant to me because of how much it mirrored my own existential crises of being caught between two cultures. For instance, it meant so much to hear Awkwafina speak Chinese the way that I speak Chinese: mangled, slightly off, with some Chinglish thrown in, and occasional pauses to ask my parents for a quick translation. I got to ask Sandra Oh about how she has built her formidable body of work as one of the few Asian actors on TV whose characters get to be their whole selves, whose cultural identities are not the sole definition of the story or catalyst for the plot. I got to talk to Mira Nair about how her movies have so powerfully evoked the experience of having to live across multiple cultures, and Sarita Choudhury about the joy of getting to see her play a glamorous South Asian woman just living her life. As I keep moving forward in my career, I’ve started to consider more deeply how I, as a culture journalist, am now shaping other people’s pop culture tastes and helping them acquire their own library of formative cultural works. It’s a role that I take seriously, trying to elevate pop culture that I find meaningful and that is likely meaningful to others. It turns out that my parents and I do have some common pop culture reference points. My dad also listens to Simon & Garfunkel. Unlike me, he did not discover them through a cartoon moose on a PBS show: He has been a fan since the 1980s (apparently when Simon & Garfunkel became popular in China). When I remember to call my parents, they often pepper me with questions: “We saw a commercial for this movie. Is it good? Will we like it?” “What movies will win Oscars this year?” “What’s that actor’s name again?” At the beginning of 2021, while staying at my parents’ house during the pandemic winter, the three of us watched “Minari,” a movie that, among other things, is about an Asian American immigrant family grappling with what it means to be American. Afterward, sitting in the same kitchen where we’d eat dinner before watching the evening news and “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” each night, where I’d pore over those newspapers and magazines, my dad said to me: “I liked it because obviously, I can relate to it. But what if only people like us like it?” I responded: “Who cares? We shouldn’t have to ask that question. Countless times, we’ve had to imagine ourselves in movies and TV that were not about us and that we couldn’t directly relate to.” Earlier this year, I got to interview the cast of “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” featuring a career-defining role for the legendary Michelle Yeoh and an unexpected career comeback for ’80s child star Ke Huy Quan. Recounting reading my article, my dad said: “Wow, I always wondered what happened to that kid from ‘The Goonies’ and ‘Indiana Jones’!” Over the years, my parents and I have butted heads over my career choices, and sometimes it’s still hard for them to understand what I do and how hard it was for me to get here. So for my dad to have learned something from my reporting means the world to me. For my parents, I am now their pop culture guide — a role that I never expected. And slowly, I’ve been able to guide them toward more pop culture that looks like and feels like us. Like my early attempts at assembling some pop culture building blocks, it’s complicated and imperfect, and it might always remain a work in progress. But instead of a patchwork of whatever I could find, it’s starting to feel a bit more whole. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
11,"Mug Shots Can Ruin Lives, And They’re All Over Facebook",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mug shots are a snapshot of the worst days of people’s lives. They’re taken when someone has been accused of a crime, but not convicted; fodder for the public’s voyeuristic impulses even if they serve no purpose to the public. No matter what happens next — whether a person is cleared, convicted, serves their sentence or has their record expunged — many of those photos continue floating around the internet. They can keep popping up for years, including in searches when someone is looking for a job, when they’re trying to build a safe life or even in news stories when they are victims of a crime. They can make people the targets of racism, threats and public humiliation. In recent years, there’s been a shift away from publicly posting mug shots in the media and by some law enforcement offices. Several news outlets have said they will no longer publish daily mug shot galleries or post mug shots of people who have been arrested but not yet convicted of a crime. But that reckoning has yet to hit one of the widest-reaching platforms in the world: Facebook. The platform continues to allow law enforcement agencies to post mug shots, usually of people who have not been convicted of a crime. If a local law enforcement agency doesn’t actively post mug shots to Facebook, sometimes individual users will — a web of amateur-run “local mug shot” pages have spread across the platform. Often the person pictured in the mug shot will be recognized, or even tagged, in the comments, prompting a pile-on from members of their community. The more people comment and react to the mug shot, the further the post will travel throughout the social media platform. Even if the individual is never convicted of a crime, there is no mechanism for getting the image removed. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment, but it often claims that it is a neutral platform rather than a publisher that makes editorial decisions about the content on its site. In reality, Facebook does moderate content and the company has policies prohibiting certain content it deems too harmful. Although enforcement is inconsistent, Facebook claims to prohibit bullying, harassment, hate speech and posts containing personal or confidential information that could lead to physical or financial harm. Mug shots typically contain or invite all of the above. Pages operated by people who cull mug shots from the local sheriff department’s websites and repost them on Facebook attract tens of thousands of users who gleefully gawk at the arrests of people in their communities. Because the mug shot pages are location-specific, Facebook users often recognize the people in the mug shots and comment with intrusive commentary about their lives. “She is trash cuz someone else is raising her kids,” a member of the Niagara County Mugshots group — which has 24,000 followers — commented on a picture of a mug shot. “Dude didn’t give her the d she tried to take it im guessing by the look on her face,” another group member commented on a different mug shot. The Niagara County Mugshots page links to a merch page which sells T-shirts that say, “PUBLICLY SHAME YOUR LOCAL SEX OFFENDER.” Even when group members don’t recognize the individual under arrest, the comments typically devolve into hateful vitriol. “Make sure to disinfect him before you release him into the wild again,” one commenter posted. “Another Polish monster removed from society. Though, is justice really being served? Locking up a Polish person is like sending a dog to prison. They have no idea what they did wrong, or why they are there,” another wrote. “They’re producing content like any other content creator. It’s to get clicks, it’s to engage.” Even some law enforcement officials have acknowledged the harm caused by mug shots spreading online. A spokesperson for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office praised the Houston Chronicle for doing away with mug shot galleries. The San Francisco Police Department announced in 2020 it would no longer release mug shots without an immediate public safety reason. The following year, California state lawmakers restricted law enforcement from posting mug shots on social media for people arrested on nonviolent charges. But throughout the country, cops continue to post mug shots of the arrests they make as a way of promoting their work — at the expense of those who stand accused but not convicted of a crime. The Lee County Sheriff’s Office in Florida regularly posts mug shots with salacious captions on its Facebook page, where it has 205,000 followers. The Sheriff’s Office refers to the people it arrests as “thugs” and “criminals.” The captions are written in a way that suggests the goal is to make the mug shots go viral. The posts describe the alleged crimes in theatrical detail and include hashtags and jokes about the defendants, including referring to a man arrested around Christmastime as a “Grinch.” Facebook users often respond by cheering on law enforcement and thanking them for keeping their community safe — even in cases where it’s not clear the individual arrested posed much of a threat. Facebook’s platform allows police departments to post their own content, rather than relying on the media to cover their arrests and messaging, said Sarah Esther Lageson, an associate professor at Rutgers University who researches the growth of online crime data, mug shots and criminal records. “They’re controlling the narrative and they use Facebook and mug shots as a way to show how busy they are. They’re producing content like any other content creator. It’s to get clicks, it’s to engage,” Lageson said. “And for what? Who’s bearing the brunt of the problem there? It’s the person that’s going to be publicly shamed.” The Lee County Sheriff’s Office does not appear to delete comments even when they are racist or threatening. Their mug shot posts include comments such as: “Send Pedro back to Haiti,” “Hope he gets what he deserves in prison, hopefully he will find out what’s it’s like to get violated by the other inmates,” “Illegal?,” and “Will he get a slap on the hand because he is a minority, underprivileged?” The Lee County Sheriff’s Office often posts mug shots of kids, including many who will never be found guilty of a crime. Even those who are later found guilty may be eligible for an expungement of their juvenile record as adults. Caitlyn Mumma, a public information officer at the sheriff’s office, said they try to remove mugshots of individuals whose records are expunged but not for people who are never convicted of a crime after their arrest “because it’s still a public record even if the charges get dropped.” Last year, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office posted a mug shot of a 12-year-old boy accused of making violent threats on social media, with a caption that includes the boy’s home address. The image of the child, captured on what was likely one of the worst days of his life, has been shared 27,000 times and has 45,000 comments. Several of the commenters took it upon themselves to diagnose the child with severe mental illnesses, citing the absence of tears in the mug shot. The 12-year-old boy’s parents could not be reached for comment but Lageson has done extensive research on how people respond to their mug shot blowing up online. “They get totally overwhelmed. And even if they feel like it’s a privacy violation, or due process violation, their instinct is to sort of avoid it as much as possible,” Lageson said. That leads to avoiding any circumstance that could prompt others to discover the mug shot. “Online dating, volunteering at schools, churches, applying for promotions, applying for more safe or stable housing or employment — these are all real things that people have told me they’ve stopped doing because of this,” Lageson said. “And of course, these are all the things that make us safer, because those are all factors that prevent crime.” In 2020, Facebook put out a call for proposals from academics seeking funding for research related to digital privacy. Lageson submitted a proposal that included creating a process for people to request their mug shot be removed from the platform, especially if their record had been expunged. Lageson did not receive the grant. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Republicans Criticize Biden For Not Starving Undocumented Immigrant Babies,social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Republicans criticized the Biden administration on Thursday for providing food to infants detained in its custody — effectively suggesting the babies should be starved because of their immigration status. “The Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said at a news conference. “This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.” “Baby formula should go to Americans before illegals,” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. “This should not have to be said.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) accused the administration of giving “critical supplies to illegal immigrants before the very people he took an oath to serve.” Greene referenced photos of baby formula at a border facility, likely referring to a Washington Examiner article about immigrants detained at the border receiving baby formula amid a nationwide shortage. Nehls also tweeted a link to the article. The Examiner refers to the immigrants as a “lucky group” and cites posts by Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) about “thousands and thousands of containers of baby formula” being sent to the border. Cammack said she received a photo of the deliveries from a border agent. Cammack called on people to demand the Biden administration “take the baby formula that they have basically siphoned out of the supply chain and put it back in the damn stores for American kids.” The formula shortage is a crisis. Infants need either breast milk or formula for nutrition until they are at least 1 year old, and breast milk isn’t always an option. Doctors recommend against diluting milk or formula, switching to cow’s milk or making homemade formula. So the need for Americans to access baby formula is very, very real. But babies in U.S. government custody need sustenance, too, and their parents don’t have the option of leaving detention to buy supplies. If the government didn’t provide food to the babies in its custody, they would starve. The baby formula shortage has become a popular way for Republicans to attack President Joe Biden, although few lawmakers from either party have offered actual solutions to the issue. Immigration is a popular attack line, too, so it’s not much of a surprise that the right would blame immigrant babies for stealing food from American ones. The right has demonized undocumented immigrants for years, and the U.S. has a disturbing record of neglecting or mistreating children in its care. In one of the most infamous examples, former President Donald Trump intentionally split children from their parents in an attempt to dissuade immigrants from coming to the United States. For years, Republican lawmakers have blocked efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. Republican politicians have suggested immigrant detention centers, including ones that lock up children, are too nice. The right’s claims about baby formula for undocumented kids fit into the narrative that Democrats are encouraging unauthorized immigration by not being harsher to undocumented people. Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump who championed many of that administration’s harshest immigration policies, said the Biden administration was “diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration.” How many American Parents couldn’t feed their children, or were forced to use a formula their infants couldn’t tolerate, because Biden was diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration through our open border? https://t.co/hdKFsMvzvo Cammack insisted that her screed against baby formula for undocumented infants was actually part of a pro-children agenda, and she accused the Biden administration of helping cartels smuggle immigrant kids by being insufficiently tough on the border. “It’s not these kids’ fault,” she said. “My heart breaks for these kids.” Just not enough to let them eat.

13,"As An Asian-American Woman, I Can't Step Outside Without Feeling Terrified",social-justice," Guest Writer Despite living in a city infamous for its lack of public transportation, I had excitedly accepted the challenge of getting around Los Angeles via bus, metro, or on foot. That all changed when the pandemic started. Initially, my anxiety was due to COVID-19, but then it was the trauma of watching Asian Americans like me get beat up or killed while walking on the street or on public transit in my city and cities like mine. In March 2021, seven people, mostly Asian women, were killed in the Atlanta-area mass shootings. Then, a few months ago, I saw myself in the grisly murders of Christina Lee and Michelle Go in New York City. Now, with anti-Asian hate crimes increasing by 339% last year, I’m terrified of being outside and away from the safety of my home or car. As soon as I step outside, I’m hyperalert and hypervigilant about everything and everyone around me. When anti-Asian hate crimes began to rise as the pandemic progressed, I was grateful for the mask mandate, as I thought it was helping me blend in by covering my face. I continued my routine of taking long walks in Los Angeles, thinking that this mask would provide me with anonymity and safety. However, very early on, when I was wearing a hat, sunglasses and a mask ― my entire face covered ― I heard two men snicker behind me and say, “Look at that Asian girl.” At that moment I realized that I will always stick out, regardless of how much I try to hide myself. Today I avoid being in heavily populated Asian spaces. The 2.7-square-mile Koreatown used to be my ultimate safe haven and a place where I could exist as a Korean and an American. It’s usually where I can find all the comforts and familiarities of home from across the Pacific Ocean. But these days I try to minimize my time there because I can’t help but feel like we are a massive collective target. Because of this fear, I never leave home without pepper spray, with the safety unlocked and in an accessible place in my pocket. When another body approaches, I instinctively put my hand around it in case I need to protect myself. It’s exhausting and requires more mental exertion and bodily awareness. I can’t stop looking at everyone like they’re a potential threat. I’ve created a safety plan in my head ― always keep an eye on the exit, don’t look people in the eye, have my pepper spray ready, and get ready to run. I avoid the neighbors, strangers and passersby I used to smile at and instead try to disappear even more than I already did as an Asian American ― the invisible minority. And when our cries are met with silence from our allies, the message is loud and clear, once again: We don’t matter. After Atlanta, a common recurring theme that I heard echoed among my Asian American therapy clients was that they didn’t feel acknowledged or seen by the non-Asian colleagues, peers and friends in their lives. We didn’t get the “are you OK” messages or the check-ins from non-Asian friends and co-workers. We continued to feel unseen and unheard. And so, in order to cope, we turned to each other. Asian American mental health care providers in California saw an increase in demand for services in the wake of surging anti-Asian hate incidents, including the killings in Atlanta. Crisis Text Line reported at the start of the pandemic that the number of Asian Americans seeking support more than doubled. I facilitated virtual support groups for Asian Americans after the events in Atlanta, and the familiar feelings of fear, loneliness, isolation and anger united us from all over the country. I met Asian Americans from all sorts of cultures and backgrounds: Korean, Chinese, Indian, Filipino, trans-racial adoptees, third-culture kids, and those without access to an Asian community. Due to many years of my internalized racism and succumbing to the model minority myth, I am the “token Asian” of my friend group, which has resulted in a lack of real connection to an Asian community. Therefore, I cherished my time in these support groups. I also needed support and understanding. We cried together and processed our fears together. We talked about our vision and goals for how we want to move forward as Asian Americans, individually and collectively. We validated and offered support to each other, which made us feel safe and connected, regulating our nervous systems and allowing us access to deeper parts of the brain used for thinking and processing. We decided that we need to be louder and prouder. We need to mobilize and use our voices even when we feel stuck and frozen. We need to educate, speak up and spread awareness. We need to see ourselves and each other if we want others to see us. So lately I’ve been trying something new. I’ve been actively seeking and cultivating relationships with other Asian Americans as a way to feel like a part of a community ― which is a basic need, as humans are biologically wired to want to connect and belong. With them, I don’t have to explain the filial piety and sense of guilt and duty I have toward my parents. I can sing songs in Korean at karaoke. We can order all the spicy food and name all the dishes correctly. With them, I feel safe and accepted, even as the world keeps spinning and the anti-Asian violence continues.

14,Tucker Carlson Goes Full-Bigot To Assess Karine Jean-Pierre's Qualifications,social-justice," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson proudly wore his prejudice Tuesday in a cheap shot at new White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. (Watch the video below.) Jean-Pierre is the first Black woman and openly gay person to hold the position being vacated by Jen Psaki this week. Jean-Pierre previously worked as President Joe Biden’s deputy press secretary. The popular Fox News host declared that the administration had found someone as “shallow, nasty and partisan” as Psaki. He then assessed Jean-Pierre’s job qualifications as only someone who hates others on first sight could. “Karine Jean-Pierre is our first out LGBTQ+ White House press secretary and that’s all you need to know,” Carlson said. “It’s a good thing, shut up and celebrate. That’s why she got the job. She’s in the right group and to the Biden administration, which thinks exclusively in terms of groups and never in terms of individuals because individuals are messy and inconvenient. The group is all that matters.” “Show us your picture and we’ll tell you if you’re qualified for the job,” he added. Carlson has a deep history of homophobic and racist comments.

15,Less Immigrant Labor Across US Contributing To Price Hikes,social-justice," Just 10 miles from the Rio Grande, Mike Helle’s farm is so short of immigrant workers that he’s replaced 450 acres of labor-intensive leafy greens with crops that can be harvested by machinery. In Houston, Al Flores increased the price of his BBQ restaurant’s brisket plate because the cost of the cut doubled due to meatpacking plants’ inability to fully staff immigrant-heavy production lines. In the Dallas area, Joshua Correa raised prices on the homes his company builds by $150,000 to cover increased costs stemming partly from a lack of immigrant labor. After immigration to the United States tapered off during the Trump administration — then ground to a near complete halt for 18 months during the coronavirus pandemic — the country is waking up to a labor shortage partly fueled by that slowdown. The U.S. has, by some estimates, 2 million fewer immigrants than it would have if the pace had stayed the same, helping power a desperate scramble for workers in many sectors, from meatpacking to homebuilding, that is also contributing to supply shortages and price increases. “These 2 million missing immigrants are part of the reason we have a labor shortage,” said Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California at Davis, who calculated the shortfall. “In the short run, we are going to adjust to these shortages in the labor market through an increase in wages and in prices.” The labor issues are among several contributors to the highest inflation in 40 years in the United States — from supply chains mangled by the pandemic to a surge in energy and commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Steve Camarota, a researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, believes a spike in illegal immigration under President Joe Biden will make up whatever shortfall lingers from the pandemic. He also contends wage increases in low-paying sectors like agriculture are minor contributors to inflation. “I don’t think wages going up is bad for the poor, and I think mathematically it is not possible to drive down inflation by limiting wages at the bottom,” Camarota told The Associated Press. Immigration is rapidly returning to its pre-pandemic levels, researchers say, but the U.S. would need a significant acceleration to make up its deficit. Given a sharp decline in births in the United States over the past two decades, some economists forecast the overall pool of potential workers will start shrinking by 2025. The immigrant worker shortage comes as the U.S. political system is showing less of an appetite for increasing immigration. Democrats — who control all branches of the federal government and more recently have been the party more friendly to immigration — haven’t tried to advance major legislation permitting more new residents to the country. A recent Gallup poll showed worries about illegal immigration at a two-decade high. With a tough election for their party looming in November, Democrats are increasingly divided about the Biden administration’s attempt to end pandemic-related restrictions on seeking asylum. “At some point we either decide to become older and smaller or we change our immigration policy,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former official in President George W. Bush’s administration who is president of the center-right American Action Forum. He acknowledged a change in immigration policy is unlikely: “The bases of both parties are so locked in.” That’s certainly the case in Republican-dominated Texas, which includes the longest and busiest stretch of the southern border. The Legislature in 2017 forced cities to comply with federal immigration agents seeking people who are in the U.S. illegally. Gov. Greg Abbott sent the Texas National Guard to patrol the border and recently created traffic snarls by ordering more inspections at border ports. The turn against immigration distresses some Texas business owners. “Immigration is very important for our workforce in the United States,” said Correa. “We just need it.” He’s seeing delays of two to three months on his projects as he and his subcontractors — from drywallers to plumbers to electricians — struggle to field crews. Correa has raised the standard price of his houses from $500,000 to about $650,000. “We’re feeling it and, if we’re feeling it at the end of the day as builders and developers, the consumer pays the price,” said Correa, who spoke from Pensacola, Florida, where he brought a construction crew as a favor to a client whose hasn’t been able to find laborers to fix a beach house damaged by Hurricane Sally in 2020. The share of the U.S. population born in another country — 13.5% in the latest census — is the highest it has been since the 19th century. But even before Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election vowing to cut immigration, migration to the United States was slowing. The Great Recession dried up many jobs that drew workers to the country, legally or illegally. Rising standards of living in Latin America have prodded more people to stay put — or to return from the United States. Flores, who runs a chain of Mexican restaurants as well as his barbecue restaurant, said while the COVID-19 pandemic was a bigger shock to his industry, the immigration slowdown has hit it hard — and not just for meatpackers that supply his restaurant’s brisket. “You’ve got a lot of positions that aren’t being filled,” he said. He’s steadily raised pay, up to $15 an hour recently. “This is a culmination of years and years,” said Flores, who’s president of the Greater Houston Restaurant Association. Helle, who raises onion, cabbage, melons and kale just outside the border town of McAllen, Texas, is also paying more to his workers, who are almost exclusively immigrants. People born in the U.S., he says, won’t work the fields regardless of the pay. Before he could find farmworkers just in the region. Now he’s joined a federal program to bring agricultural workers across the border. It’s more expensive for him, but he said it’s the only way he can keep his crops from spoiling in the ground. Helle, 60, has farmed the area for decades. “I live 10 miles from the Rio Grande river and I never in my life thought we’d be in this situation.”"

0,Afghan Evacuees Face Serious Struggles Without Congressional Help,social-justice," Afghan Fellow, HuffPost The 76,000 Afghans who were airlifted out of their country and relocated to the U.S. last year have made a fresh start in the U.S. But they have no guarantee of staying unless Congress passes legislation that would offer a pathway to legal status for the Afghans who were forced to flee. Evacuees and their allies are holding a day of action on Thursday to push for lawmakers to include legal status for Afghans in the U.S. as part of a broader budget bill that largely focuses on relief for Ukraine. President Joe Biden called for including Afghans in the legislation, and some lawmakers have voiced their support. But numerous attempts to include this version of the measure, called the Afghan Adjustment Act, have failed due to objections from Senate Republicans. If it’s omitted again, Afghans who were welcomed by the U.S. when it pulled out of their country, leaving the Taliban to take over, will be left to fend for themselves here. The two main options for long-term protection available to Afghans are asylum and special immigrant status — both complicated, potentially costly and uncertain processes. “I can’t even plan my life and business for more than a year here,” Maryam Yousufi, a journalist and entrepreneur who is now settled in Washington, D.C., said in an interview. Yousufi was a well-known face in the Afghan media, having worked with many local and international platforms, including the U.S.-funded Voice of America. She started a small business designing and selling traditional luxury Afghan clothing to local and international consumers only a year before Kabul fell. “You have life, you have family and you have business, and all of a sudden you have to leave all of them behind to seek protection somewhere else,” Yousufi said. Yousufi is working to restart her business after months of struggling to settle down in the U.S. She had some of her products shipped to the U.S. and is now looking to register her brand here. “This is a new beginning for me, and I’m excited about it,” she said. Now she just needs to ensure she can continue. The protection for Yousufi is just temporary. Last August, the Biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow Afghans to enter the U.S. for a two-year period. Parole status is not recognized as an immigration status, and there is no road to permanent residency for those who enter the country on parole. Since the parole status is temporary, these Afghans must adjust their status — which means obtaining a green card, asylum or some other visa — in order to stay long-term and avoid possible deportation. “The worst-case scenario for Afghans unable to adjust their status is that the current temporary protection options expire and they are unable to find another pathway,” said Sarah Ivory, president of USAHello, a nonprofit working for refugees. “In this case, they would become undocumented and risk deportation.” The Biden administration announced in March the designation of temporary protected status, or TPS, for any Afghans residing in the U.S. as of March 15. This protects Afghan parolees from having to return to unsafe conditions — but it would only extend the temporary protection and does not guarantee permanent residency. Permanent residency and eventual citizenship do not just protect people from deportation. It would also allow them to apply to bring relatives to the U.S., something many Afghans are desperate to do. “My wife and children are in danger [in Afghanistan], and I want to bring them over as soon as possible,” Sultanzai, who requested that his full name not be used for security concerns, said. Sultanzai is a former member of Afghan security forces who worked closely with the American forces in eastern Afghanistan for eight years until 2018. He was flown to the U.S. last August and now lives in the D.C. area. Sultanzai had been on the Taliban’s “kill list” for years, and many of his comrades had been ruthlessly killed in recent years. Rather than endangering his family’s safety on the road to Kabul, he ventured out alone to see if he could track down his former superiors first and get his loved ones on a flight out later. He was able to get into the airport, but was immediately boarded on a flight. It was too late to help his family. He recalled someone telling him during boarding, “Save yourself first, then bring your family later.” But he’s not sure how to do it. One of the ways that Afghan parolees are able to adjust their status to a more permanent status is through the special immigrant visa (SIV) program. Evacuees who apply have to be employed for at least one year by an approved entity and also get a letter from their supervisor in support. “I feel abandoned and confused,” Sultanzai said. He said his American supervisors guaranteed him an SIV when he worked with them. He has enough certificates and photos to prove that he worked with the Americans, but he is unable to obtain a letter of support from them because he has been out of his post for several years and he lost his contacts. “They all vanished, no email address, no phone number,” Sultanzai said. His inability to communicate in English also prevents him from reaching out to others who may assist him. Many Afghans are currently in various stages of obtaining an SIV and are unsure of their next steps. Yousufi would also like to pursue SIV status based on her work with Voice of America. But she has only received her initial approval after four months and has yet to file a petition. The program has a backlog of tens of thousands of applications, making it even more difficult for SIV applicants to adjust their status in time, especially those who recently applied to the program. Those who do not qualify for the SIV program must petition for asylum. The majority of Afghan parolees have only four months left to file an asylum petition, which is currently the only option for most of them to adjust their status. All asylum applicants must apply within one year of their last entry into the U.S. SIV applicants are also considering applying for asylum during these next four months because there has been no progress on their application and they don’t want to wait any longer. “I don’t want to risk waiting to hear from SIV,” said Yousufi. She has only a few months left to find legal help, prepare documents and submit her petitions. But like the SIV program, the asylum system is extremely backlogged, demanding and hard to navigate. There was already a 400,000-case backlog of asylum applications before the arrival of this wave of Afghans in the U.S. “Asylum is a very high threshold to meet,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a group that aids refugees and migrants. The petitioner must have enough documentation to prove that they are personally at risk of persecution if they were to return to their home country. These documents may not be available to Afghans, who had to pass through Taliban checkpoints on their way out of the country. “Some [asylum-seekers] may have even destroyed documents that would be helpful in an asylum proceeding, but a death sentence in the hands of the Taliban.” “Some may have even destroyed documents that would be helpful in an asylum proceeding, but a death sentence in the hands of the Taliban,” Vignarajah said. Navigating the asylum process in the U.S. is nearly impossible without the assistance of an immigration lawyer. There aren’t enough pro bono lawyers to help the tens of thousands of Afghans in such a short time. Plus, most Afghans do not have the financial resources to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. “Their cases could be rejected,” Ivory said. “ Especially if they do not have legal support in putting together their petition.” For Afghans like Sultanzai who lack English skills, navigating the process could be even harder. Many Afghans are unaware that they must apply for asylum before it is too late. The resettlement agencies that assisted Afghans in filing for basic resettlement needs such as housing and food programs only offer support for 90 days. The rest is on them. Sultanzai has not been able to find legal support yet. “I don’t even know what to do next,” he said. Biden called on Congress last week to pass legislation that would help Afghan parolees to adjust their status as part of his request for emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine. Refugee groups urged their members to call representatives and share their stories on Thursday to push for Congress to include them in the funding. “We need everyone across our country calling into their representatives and senators to ask them to include this in the Ukrainian supplemental,” Shawn VanDiver, the founder and board chair of AfghanEvac, a coalition of organizations helping at-risk Afghans relocate and resettle, told HuffPost. “This is the shot we have. There won’t be another opportunity until 2023 and neither Afghans or the veterans who they stood with can wait that long. We need this to happen now and we need folks on both sides to not play partisan games.” Advocacy groups have been urging Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act for months as a way out of the limbo in which Afghans find themselves. If passed, this would give Afghan parolees a direct route to lawful permanent residency, bypassing all other options, including SIV and asylum. “The Afghan Adjustment Act would create a fast track for Afghans that would acknowledge that, by virtue of their evacuation and the events that have unfolded, they already meet the standards for humanitarian protection,” Ivory said. Advocates hope the White House’s latest request will help. “This request is a promising sign for the legislation’s chances of passing,” Vignarajah said.“We remain hopeful that Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize the urgency and moral imperative to do right by those who fought and served alongside us in Afghanistan.” But sources in the Senate told HuffPost that numerous attempts to include this version of the Afghan Adjustment Act have failed due to objections from Senate Republicans. “Given that, its future is uncertain in the supplemental as well,” said one staffer, who requested anonymity to discuss the situation. “We shall see.” Afghan Fellow, HuffPost"
1,"Like Many Mothers, I'm Returning To Work After The Pandemic. But I Wasn’t Welcomed Back.",social-justice," Guest Writer Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I slogged away as a Ph.D. student, a primary parent of two young daughters, and an occupational therapist with two jobs: one as a part-time outpatient OT at a hand therapy clinic, and one at the local hospital in the pediatric intensive care unit on weekends. I was furloughed from my position as an outpatient OT at the beginning of the pandemic, and I needed to remain home with my two daughters anyway when schools closed. While we hunkered down, they watched ungodly amounts of TV and I miraculously finished my dissertation. (My kindergartner did not fare as well academically on Zoom school.) I defended my dissertation anticlimactically via Zoom, wearing a button-up and slippers. I came downstairs a doctor, and immediately needed to clean up homemade slime from the floor. After nine months of picking up on-call weekends at the hospital, I found a part-time research position where I could work from home. My daughters, 4 and 7 at the time, were still at home due to school closures, so working from home was a necessity. I wasn’t alone in this situation. Following the onset of COVID, women left the workforce in droves for these same reasons. Even for those whose jobs could be performed at home, many were driven out by the added demands of household management and caring for children who were suddenly home from school and day care. Even once my children’s schools reopened, any COVID symptom could still require them to stay home, which added a spontaneous spin to the game I called “How Much Can I Work This Week.” My younger daughter likes to crawl on the bathroom floor (because she’s a kitten, obviously) and then lick her hands, causing her to develop approximately 295 colds per year and take subsequent sick days off school. I also needed to be ready at any given moment to pick my kids up when there was an inevitable positive case in one of their classrooms, lest they marinate in a COVID petri dish a moment longer. While I felt grateful for my remote research position, especially with my kitten-human hybrid child and her perpetually runny nose, I desperately missed the connection with patients ― and I needed more hours of work. Around this time, someone actually asked me whether finding a new job would be “fair to the employer,” given the unpredictability of my schedule amid the roller coaster of school closures and COVID waves. I mourned the losses suffered by women in the workplace as data emerged and headlines read “Coronavirus child-care crisis will set women back a generation.” I’d worked tirelessly my entire adult life to earn advanced degrees, and yet in a blink, they seemed inconsequential. I felt I had failed at expanding my daughters’ understanding of what women were capable of, an effort generations in the making. A year and a half into the pandemic, I finally returned to steady inpatient hospital work during the week, once my daughters’ school schedules felt relatively reliable. I assumed everyone would be understanding of my interrupted professional life, given the upheavals we’d all presumably experienced in the COVID era. I was assigned to a new department, which I was very excited about. There, it soon became evident that I was expected not only to learn new clinical skills, navigate the culture of the department and refresh my lost self, but to do so quickly. Where I had expected empathy, I was instead greeted with hostility, apathy and criticism about the gap in my patient care experience. I was told I lacked “basic” skills (after 10+ years in the field), and that my “break” from clinical care was detrimental. “This is why full-time is different from weekends,” a supervisor sneered, as if I’d recently returned from vacation. Being a parent during the pandemic had required a total paradigm shift in my work, yet the outside world seemed unchanged. Naturally, the people who said such things were not parents themselves. They found it difficult to understand what parents experienced during the pandemic, like the gravity of our professional despair as our lives revolved around homeschooling and the monotony of making snacks every nine minutes. At work, I cared for infants. It was not lost on me that my ability to quickly develop a rapport with new mothers, and provide personal insight into the trials of breastfeeding, came from the same parent who’d spent the previous two years keeping a family alive, psychologically safe and intellectually stimulated. The employer enjoyed the former skill set, but not the latter. Within two months, it became evident that I was not welcome to bring my whole self to this position. I attempted to salvage my role, to no avail. I left the hospital altogether two months after that. I continued working remotely part-time, doing research for my other institution. But I did not want to completely leave patient care behind. I’ve recently started part-time at a new hospital, and have been met with flexible scheduling and photos of colleagues’ children, which felt like a warm hug. This phase of the pandemic is providing the opportunity for more women to return to work— but only if they are welcomed. It may take a beat for the mothers who left the workforce in 2020 to regain our professional footing. Some of us may have years-long gaps on our resumes due to caring for children, parents or other dependents, responsibilities that often fall to women. Companies need to expect this, plan for it, and consider it another casualty of the pandemic, rather than a reflection of a woman’s capabilities. This is necessary to reclaim the net 5.4 million women’s jobs we lost during the pandemic. Of course, I am beyond fortunate. I was not trapped with an abuser during this time. I have a partner and that partner kept his job. In general, Black and Latina women fared far worse than white women when it comes to employment. I also want to recognize that some male parents stayed at home with their children during the pandemic. For many, though, the pandemic drove families into antiquated gender stereotypes. It’s likely that COVID is not over, and that a new wave will be upon us soon. Parents again may need to leave work at a moment’s notice when a COVID case forces a child’s classroom to close. Organizations need to work proactively to welcome mothers back into the workforce nonetheless. Otherwise, we are actively supporting our collective regression into generations past. We are effectively undoing our mothers’ and grandmothers’ and great-grandmothers’ battles to give women a choice. I, and the many other moms who’ve had to take time out of the workforce, need your grace and understanding. This might take the form of flexible work schedules, awareness of important meetings held in the late afternoon or early evening, or a mutually agreed-upon timeline of skill acquisition. We need help easing the transition, and empathy about the gaps in our work experience. In many ways, the pandemic stripped away the illusion of boundaries between work and home. We can no longer work like we don’t have children, or parent like we don’t have jobs. We are bringing our whole selves to work, and we deserve respect for our experiences, including motherhood.

2,Sydney Man Gets 12 Years For Pushing Gay American Off A Cliff In 1988,social-justice," CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — An Australian man was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison Tuesday for the 1988 murder of an American who fell off a Sydney cliff that was known as a gay meeting place. The death of mathematician Scott Johnson was initially called a suicide, but his family pressed for further investigation. A coroner in 2017 found a number of assaults, some fatal, where the victims had been targeted because they were thought to be gay. Scott White, 51, pleaded guilty in January and could have been sentenced to up to life in prison. Justice Helen Wilson said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, an aggravating factor that would have led to a longer sentence. She also said she applied more lenient sentencing patterns in place in New South Wales state in the late 1980s. He must serve at least eight years and three months in prison before he can be considered for parole. White was 18 and homeless when he met 27-year-old Los Angeles-born Johnson at a bar in suburban Manly in December 1988 and went with him to a nearby cliff top at North Head. White’s former wife Helen White told police in 2019 that her then-husband had bragged about beating gay men and had said the only good gay man was a dead gay man. She told the court on Monday that her husband had told her Johnson had run off the cliff. Scott White told police that he was himself gay and frightened that his homophobic brother would find out. Wilson said it was not possible to draw any conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt about what had happened at the clifftop. “The offender hit Dr. Johnson, causing him to stumble backwards and leave the cliff edge,” Wilson said. “In those seconds when he must have realized what was happening to him, Dr. Johnson must have been terrified, aware that he would strike the rocks below and conscious of his fate,” Wilson added. “It was a terrible death.” Wilson did not accept the defense lawyers’ argument that Helen White had been motivated to report him to police by a reward. Under cross-examination on Monday, Helen White denied she had been aware of a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward for information on Johnson’s murder when she went to police in 2019. She said she only became aware of a reward when the victim’s brother, Steve Johnson, doubled the sum in 2020. Outside court, Boston resident Steve Johnson thanked prosecutors and the judicial system for ensuring White was sent to prison. “We didn’t get compensation for Scott this week but what Scott got was dignity,” the older sibling told reporters. Younger sister Rebecca Johnson said she was satisfied with the sentence. “Today I feel like we’ve had answers and we’ve had justice, and that’s for our brother and that’s for gay men who were bashed or killed in that era,” she said. White had a record of violent crime before and after the murder but had not committed any offense since 2008. “It should be understood that the court is not sentencing a violent and reckless young man for a targeted attack on a gay man,” Wilson said. “Because of the lapse of time, the offender is no longer the same angry young man who raised his fists to another on the edge of a cliff. Neither is the court imposing a sentence for a crime motivated by hatred for a particular sector of society. The evidence is too slender to support that,” Wilson added. She said a sentence for the same crime today would be “much higher.” White’s lawyers have appealed his conviction and hope he will be acquitted of the murder charge in a jury trial. A coroner ruled in 2017 that Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence by unidentified persons who attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.” The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some men were also robbed. A coroner had ruled in 1989 that Johnson had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died. Johnson studied at universities in California and at Cambridge in Britain before moving to Australia in 1986 to live with his Australian partner Michael Noone. They lived in Canberra where Johnson studied at the Australian National University which posthumously awarded him a Ph.D. He was staying a Noone’s parents’ Sydney home when he died."
3,Sydney Man Admits Pushing Gay American Off A Cliff In 1988,social-justice," CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A man told police he killed American mathematician Scott Johnson in 1988 by pushing the 27-year-old off a Sydney cliff in what prosecutors describe as a gay hate crime, a court heard on Monday. Scott White, 51, appeared in the New South Wales state Supreme Court for a sentencing hearing after he pleaded guilty in January to the murder of the Los Angeles-born Canberra resident, whose death at the base of a North Head cliff was initially dismissed by police as suicide. White will be sentenced by Justice Helen Wilson on Tuesday. He faces a potential sentence of life in prison. “I pushed a bloke. He went over the edge,” White said in recorded police interview in 2020 that was played in court. White said in the interview he lied when he had earlier told police that he had tried to grab Johnson and prevent his fatal fall. A coroner ruled in 2017 that Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence by unidentified persons who attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.” The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed. A coroner had ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died. His Boston-based brother Steve Johnson maintained pressure for further investigation and offered his own reward of 1 million Australian dollars ($704,000) for information. White was charged in 2020 and police say the reward will likely be collected. White’s former wife Helen White told the court that her then-husband “bragged” to their children of beating gay men at the clifftop well-known for gay meetups. Helen White said she read a newspaper report in 2008 about Johnson’s death and asked her husband if he was responsible. “It’s not my fault,” Scott White allegedly replied. “The dumb (expletive) ran off the cliff.” “I said, ‘It is if you chased him,’” Helen White told the court. She said her husband did not reply. Under cross-examination, Helen White denied she had been aware of a AU$1 million reward for information on Johnson’s murder when she reported her former husband to police in 2019. She said she only became aware of a reward when the victim’s brother, Steve Johnson, doubled the sum in 2020. Steve Johnson said in his victim impact statement that, “With a vicious push, Mr. White took Scott and he vanished.” “This man (Scott Johnson) who once told me he could never hurt someone even in self-defense died in terror,” the brother added. Steve Johnson said he appreciated White’s guilty plea. “If he had turned himself in after his violent action, I would have had a little more sympathy. If he had grasped Scott’s hand and pulled him to safety, I would owe him everlasting gratitude,” the brother said, his voice choked with emotion. Scott Johnson’s sisters Terry and Rebecca Johnson, his partner Michael Noone and Steve Johnson’s wife Rosemarie Johnson also gave victim impact statements. Rosemarie Johnson described the initial police failure to investigate Scott Johnson’s death as “indefensible and inhumane.” Rebecca Johnson, a younger sister, said the police report of suicide “made no sense.” “How could a community fail so spectacularly that they created boys capable of such horror?” she asked, referring to media reports of gay beatings in Sydney being described as a sport. Prosecutor Brett Hatfield said the precise details of the murder were not known and that White’s accounts had varied. White had met Johnson in a nearby bar in suburban Manly and Johnson had stripped naked at the clifftop before he died, Hatfield said. He said the gravity of the murder was significantly elevated because it was motivated by the victim’s sexuality. White’s lawyer Belinda Rigg said her client was gay and had been concerned that his homophobic brother would find out. In January, White yelled repeatedly in court during a pre-trial hearing that he was guilty, having previously denied the crime. His lawyers will appeal that plea in the Court of Criminal Appeals and hope he will be acquitted at trial. Scott Johnson was a doctoral student at Australian National University and lived in Canberra. He was staying at Noone’s parents’ Sydney home when he died."
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Christians Aid Migrants Because Church Is Run By Satan: Marjorie Taylor Greene,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) recently told a far-right Catholic media organization that “Satan’s controlling the church” of Christians who provide aid to undocumented immigrants. The extremist lawmaker, whose website boasts of her “strong Christian faith,” sat down for an interview Thursday with right-wing activist Michael Voris, founder of Church Militant. In a clip from the interview released by the group Right Wing Watch, Voris asked Greene about Catholic organizations in the U.S. that use federal funding to help resettle undocumented immigrants and refugees. “I thought we had a separation of church and state,” Greene said in response. “What it is, is Satan’s controlling the church,” she continued. “The church is not doing its job, and it’s not adhering to the teachings of Christ, and it’s not adhering to what the word of God says we’re supposed to do and how we’re supposed to live.” She added that Christian groups that say you should take care of migrants are “destroying our laws” and taking advantage of Americans. “Yes, we are supposed to love one another, but their definition of what love one another means, means destroying our laws,” she said. “It means completely perverting what our Constitution says. It means taking unreal advantage of the American taxpayer. And it means pushing a globalist policy on the American people and forcing America to become something that we are not supposed to be.” She also suggested that the U.S. government should sever foreign aid to the home countries of undocumented immigrants who are “illegally invading.” “We should hold those countries accountable,” she said. “‘Oh, I’m sorry, Guatemala, you’re not getting a check this year because you’ve sent X number of thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people to illegally invade our country as if they’re an army.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene says that Christian organizations are working to resettle undocumented immigrants and refugees in the U.S. because ""Satan's  controlling the church."" https://t.co/cbnTrbOjuY pic.twitter.com/3N3X72ZLgc Greene’s comments earned a rebuke from the Catholic League, an organization that defends the religious and civil rights of Catholics. In a statement, the group’s president, Bill Donohue, called Greene “a disgrace” and said she needed to apologize immediately. “She had plenty of opportunities to make rational criticisms of the agency, but instead she slandered the entire Catholic Church,” he said. “We are contacting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy about this matter. He’s got a loose cannon on his hands.” Voris, a devout supporter of former President Donald Trump, has claimed that Catholics support men like Trump because they “no longer see any trace of masculinity in their religious leaders.” In 2020, he warned that not voting for Trump would result in Christians being “identified, hunted down, declared ‘illegal’ for some made-up reason.” “Don’t be expressing your regrets as you’re herded onto the trains heading for the camps,” he wrote. In Church Militant’s write-up of Greene’s interview, it declared she was “universally despised by the Marxist Left for her straight shooting and belief in Christ” and claimed that was the reason Greene’s critics are “using trumped-up accusations about Jan. 6” to block her from running for reelection. The day after the interview, Greene testified in a hearing about whether she is qualified to run for reelection in Georgia. She is accused of assisting the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which could be considered a violation of the 14th Amendment prohibition on members of Congress taking part in an “insurrection or rebellion.” She faces a lawsuit from a group of her constituents represented by Free Speech for People, an organization that advocates for fair elections.

11,Judge Halts Preparations For End Of Title 42 U.S. Asylum Limits,social-justice," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Biden administration must stop what amounts to the phasing out a pandemic-related public health rule allowing the expulsion of migrants without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum, a federal judge in Louisiana ruled Wednesday. The administration plans to end the policy outright on May 23. But it acknowledged in recent court filings that it has recently processed more single adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador under immigration laws — which include rights to seek asylum — instead of the public health policy. U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays, in Lafayette, issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, saying the administration must stop the stepped-up processing for at least the next two weeks. He also said in his ruling that states suing to stop the termination of the public health policy are likely to succeed in court. Twenty-two states are challenging plans to keep the administration from ending the expulsion policy, which was put in place under former President Donald Trump’s administration in 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Louisiana, Arizona and 19 other states filed suit in U.S. District Court in Lafayette, Louisiana. Texas filed a similar suit in Victoria, Texas, on Friday. Summerhays, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump, presides over the Louisiana-based case in Lafayette. He has scheduled a May 13 hearing on the larger issue of whether President Joe Biden can end the pandemic migration rule. The plaintiff states had asked him last week to issue an order blocking the administration from processing more migrants under immigration law instead of the public health rule. About 14% of single adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were processed under immigration laws during a seven-day period ending last Thursday, the administration had acknowledged. That’s up from only 5% in March, according to government figures. “Under this temporary restraining order. Defendants are required to return to policies and practices in place prior to the issuance of the Termination Order, which should have the result (all else being equal) of returning to historical practices in line with historical benchmarks,” Summerhays wrote. Migrants have been expelled more than 1.8 million times under the rule invoked in March 2020. Advocates for asylum-seekers support the end to the rule, which they say endangers people fleeing persecution back home and violates rights to seek protection under U.S. law and international treaty. The states challenging the administration say the U.S. is not ready for a likely influx of migrants resulting from the rule’s end, straining public services and economies. At two often-contentious hearings Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sought to defend the administration’s handling of an increase migrants at the Southwest border and its plans to deal with the prospect of more with the potential end of Title 42. Mayorkas sought to push back on Republican accusations that the Biden administration has encouraged irregular migration by allowing some people to seek asylum, blaming economic and political turmoil and violence throughout Latin America and the world. “Some of the causes of irregular migration have only been heightened by years of distress preceding this administration,” he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Ben Fox in Washington contributed to this story.

13,Supreme Court Hears Arguments Over 'Remain In Mexico' Policy For Asylum-Seekers,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is seeking the Supreme Court’s go-ahead to end a controversial Trump-era immigration program that forces some people seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico for their hearings. The justices are hearing arguments Tuesday in the administration’s appeal of lower-court rulings that required immigration officials to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” policy that the administration “has twice determined is not in the interests of the United States,” according to court filings. Texas and Missouri, which sued to keep the program in place, said it has helped reduce the flow of people into the U.S. at the southern border. “Many raise meritless immigration claims, including asylum claims, in the hope that they will be released into the United States,” the states told the Supreme Court in a filing. About 70,000 people were enrolled in the program, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols, after President Donald Trump launched it in 2019 and made it a centerpiece of efforts to deter asylum-seekers. President Joe Biden suspended it on his first day in office and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ended it in June 2021. In October, DHS produced additional justifications for the policy’s demise, to no avail in the courts. The program resumed in December, but barely 3,000 migrants had enrolled by the end of March, during a period when authorities stopped migrants about 700,000 times at the border. The heart of the legal fight is whether the program is discretionary and can be ended, as the administration argues, or is essentially the only way to comply with what the states say is a congressional command not to release the immigrants at issue in the case into the United States. Without adequate detention facilities in the U.S., Texas and Missouri argue that the administration’s only option is to make the immigrants wait in Mexico until their asylum hearings. The two sides separately disagree about whether the way the administration went about ending the policy complies with a federal law that compels agencies to follow rules and spell out reasons for their actions. Those being forced to wait in Mexico widely say they are terrified in dangerous Mexican border cities and find it very hard to find lawyers to handle their asylum hearings. Democratic-led states and progressive groups are on the administration’s side. Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri. Those include the America First Legal Foundation, led by former Trump aides Stephen Miller and Mark Meadows. As the court is weighing the asylum policy, the administration is expected to end another key Trump-era border policy that was put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. It allows authorities to expel migrants without a chance to seek asylum. The decision to end Title 42 authority, named for a 1944 public health law, on May 23 is being legally challenged by 22 states and faces growing division within Biden’s Democratic Party."
14,SCOTUS Blocks Biden Immigration Attempt,social-justice, Microbio
15,Supreme Court Conservatives Likely To Open Door To School Prayer,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The Supreme Court’s conservatives appear likely to rewrite the rules for allowing religious prayer in public schools after arguments were heard Monday in a case involving a football coach who prayed on the field’s 50-yard line after games. Even if the court ultimately adopts a narrow ruling in favor of the praying football coach, it would make a notable chip in the legal structure established during the 20th century to separate church and state. That would be a major victory for the Christian religious right, which has been engaged in grassroots organizing to put religious prayer back in schools since the Supreme Court’s 1962 ruling barring it from public schools. That same group backed the nominations of all six of the Supreme Court’s current conservative justices. One obstacle to a broad ruling overturning decades of precedent is that the facts in the case of Kennedy v. Bremerton School District are highly disputed. The case centers on the actions of Joe Kennedy as the football coach at a public school in Washington state. As a coach, Kennedy was known to mix religious prayer into motivational talks he gave to players. He also led students on his team and opposing teams in silent religious prayer at the 50-yard line after football games. In 2015, the school became aware of his religious prayers after receiving a complaint from an opposing team’s coach. The school tried to accommodate him by saying he could continue to give motivational talks to his players as long as they remained secular and that he could continue to pray, as long as it was somewhere more private than in the middle of the football field. After initially complying, Kennedy hired a right-wing legal nonprofit to represent him and launched a media campaign to claim persecution and bring attention to his prayers. The media blitz resulted in partisan attention to his cause as right-wing media rallied around him. It ended after he went to lead his post-game prayer at the 50-yard line and a crowd of supporters rushed the field in what a lower court deemed a “stampede” that the school district argued put students in danger. The school district then put Kennedy on administrative leave. Kennedy filed the lawsuit claiming his right to religious expression was denied. He subsequently moved to Florida. Kennedy’s lawyer, Paul Clement, sought to frame the case solely around a single instance of the coach silently praying at the 50-yard line after a football game. However, Richard Katskee, an attorney for Americans United for Separation of Church and State who argued for the school district, sought to include the whole record of Kennedy’s prayers and refusal to compromise with the district. Another dispute arose over whether Kennedy was acting in his official capacity as a public school football coach after the conclusion of a game. Clement argued that Kennedy was not acting in such a capacity because the game was over and players could go to the locker rooms as they pleased. The court’s liberal justices, however, noted that Kennedy was required to stay after games for post-game talks with his players, cleanup and making sure students and the crowd got home safely. There were also differences between the two sides about the legal principle at issue when the school district placed Kennedy on administrative leave. Katskee argued that the school district’s sanction of Kennedy was on strong legal grounds as his public prayers raised the possibility that students would feel coerced into joining them. But conservative justices brought up the school district’s initial claims, from filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that it could sanction the coach over the fear that his prayers could constitute a government endorsement of religion. Amid the wide variance in the acceptance of the facts of the case, the justices largely questioned the two lawyers about a range of hypothetical situations, as opposed to the actual one at hand. Could a math teacher tell students the class was taking a five-minute break to pray, Justice Elena Kagan wondered. Can the school fire a teacher who wears a “Nazi swastika” as part of their religious beliefs and leads students in prayer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked. What about if the coach makes a political statement like kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, Justice Clarence Thomas wanted to know. Or if they waved a Ukrainian flag in protest of Russia’s invasion, Justice Samuel Alito asked. And what if Kennedy stood at midfield with his arms raised and gave an audible prayer, Chief Justice John Roberts asked. What is clear in regard to the case is that the conservative justices are extremely likely to side with Kennedy. This was known well before the arguments, as Alito wrote a concurrence joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Thomas regarding the Kennedy case in 2019 noting their support for the claims brought in it. They are likely to have a majority with the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett now on the bench. The only question is how far a ruling goes in scaling back the limits placed on school prayer in public schools during the 20th century. The new post-Barrett court has already issued far-reaching rulings increasing protections on religious liberty, especially Christian religious liberty. This case looks likely to join those in the pantheon of decisions that will define early 21st-century jurisprudence. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Biden Has A Streamlined Plan To Admit Ukrainians To The U.S. Will It Be Fast Enough?,social-justice," Afghan Fellow, HuffPost The Biden administration’s new program to admit refugees from Ukraine could face the same processing struggles that have plagued efforts to welcome Afghans and other refugees, immigration experts warned after the program was announced on Thursday. The new plan, called Uniting for Ukraine, will allow U.S. citizens and groups to financially sponsor people fleeing Ukraine to come to the U.S. The goal is to admit 100,000 of about 5 million people who have fled since Russia invaded their country in February. U.S. officials said the program is also intended to deter Ukrainians from traveling to Mexico to attempt to enter the U.S. via the southern border. Around 15,000 undocumented Ukrainians have arrived during the last three months, mostly at the U.S.-Mexico border, senior administration officials told reporters on Thursday. The application process for the new program will be “fairly quick” — about a week for clear-cut applications, The Washington Post reported, citing a senior administration official. While immigration and refugee advocates applauded the goal of the program, past efforts to expand refugee admission to the U.S. suggest it won’t be so simple to bring in 100,000 Ukrainians. “The administration is saying they expect these cases to be decided within a week — I think that’s very ambitious,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, Bipartisan Policy Center’s managing director of immigration and cross-border policy. “I hope they’re right, but I’m currently skeptical.” The streamlined process, set to launch on April 25, will rely on a humanitarian parole program, a tool mostly used for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. It allows certain Ukrainians who have sponsors in the U.S. to enter and stay for two years without having to seek a visa or go through backlogged refugee procedures. Humanitarian parole has been previously used in crisis circumstances to resettle Vietnamese in 1975 and Iraqi Kurds in 1996. More recently, it was used to relocate and resettle tens of thousands of Afghans in the wake of the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s takeover of the country. Afghan refugee resettlement was supposed to be accelerated, too — but it hasn’t turned out that way. In September, the Biden administration introduced humanitarian parole as a tool for speeding up the relocation of at-risk Afghans who were left behind by the U.S. pullout. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has struggled to keep up with a surge in applications that is 20 times larger than the total number of applications it receives in a typical year, Al Jazeera reported. The process has stalled after almost seven months. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told Al Jazeera in February that of more than 40,000 Afghan humanitarian parole applications filed since July 2021, it had denied 930 and conditionally approved just 160. The overwhelming majority have yet to be processed, and the agency offered no timeline for their completion. The refugee resettlement process as a whole was significantly damaged by the Trump administration, which attempted to slash U.S. efforts to welcome people fleeing other countries. Biden announced a goal of admitting 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, but the U.S. is nowhere near doing so. Only 8,758 refugees have been admitted in the first six months of the current fiscal year, according to State Department figures. Prioritizing applications from Ukraine could put unprocessed cases at the bottom of the pile. “It’s not like there is excess capacity in the U.S. government, sitting around doing nothing that can now be applied to process these new applications,” Brown said. “Everybody is fully occupied processing the existing applications. And we know we have backlogs.” The Ukrainian program does have some unique aspects. Unlike Afghan evacuees who have been paroled into the United States without sponsors and were resettled through resettlement agencies, the new program requires Ukrainians to have an individual or group in the United States that’s willing to sponsor their arrival. Sponsorship is intended “to provide the initial financial and other support that will help Ukrainians integrate and regain their footing here in the United States,” said Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, a refugee group encouraging Americans to sponsor Ukrainians refugees. “We have far more capacity as a nation,” Ash said. “And we are tapping into the goodwill of a much broader range of American institutions and American people.” A YouGov poll conducted for Welcome.US shows that 72% of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and independents, support the United States welcoming Ukrainians fleeing the war. About 90 million American adults are already taking part in helping Ukrainian refugees settle in the U.S., or would like to, the survey found. But the government’s ability to process applications quickly could be an issue, Ash said. Once sponsorship is approved, Ukrainians will receive travel authorization to the United States and will be considered for parole only after they undergo vaccinations and other public health requirements, pass rigorous biometric and biographic screening, and are vetted in security checks. “I am concerned that that is going to be a potential constraint on people fleeing Ukraine being able to find safety quickly,” Ash added. Even after arrival in the U.S., Ukrainians are likely to face even more backlogs in the immigration system. While parole allows for temporary lawful presence, it does not confer immigration status and does not provide a path to lawful permanent residence. Once here, however, refugees could apply for asylum. “What’s going to happen when that temporary status expires?” Melanie Nezer, senior vice president at HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, told The Washington Post. “There is a concern that this would just add to the undocumented population here if Congress doesn’t act.” Ukrainians will be eligible for work authorization once paroled through this process, but that could take months, Brown said. Meanwhile, refugee organizations want similar protections for other refugees from around the world who have fled violence and persecution, including those who have left their homes in Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Mauritania, as well as tens of thousands more Afghan allies who were left in their country. Ash said she hopes the U.S. can replicate quicker processing for other refugees, too. “The U.S. government recognized that we needed a rapid mechanism for people to be able to come to safety,” Ash said. “These are really important innovations that now we need to standardize, replicate, and recognize for all refugee populations.” Afghan Fellow, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) raised eyebrows on Tuesday when she tweeted a dramatic exaggeration of the immigration situation on the U.S.-Mexico border. “Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 1,000,000,000 migrants at our southern border in just 6 months,” she wrote on Twitter. “President Biden’s open border policies are fueling this crisis!” According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics, between October and March, just over 1 million migrants were apprehended or expelled at the southern border. Her post stayed up more than five hours before it was deleted. Lesko’s erroneous tweet appeared in the wake of news that the state of Florida, led by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, has banned dozens of proposed math textbooks because they supposedly reference critical race theory and other “prohibited topics.” Commentators concluded that banning math materials might not be the best idea: This is what happens when you ban the math books. https://t.co/Ow3duUVF5Q 4 hours and this is still up.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Texas Governor Dumps First Busload Of Migrants In DC For Political Stunt,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) congratulated himself Wednesday for dumping a busload of immigrants in the heart of Washington, D.C., as part of a political tantrum over President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. The stunt allows the Biden administration “to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border,” Abbott claimed in a press release. The migrants arrived at a building near Capitol Hill that is home to the Washington bureaus of Fox News, NBC News and C-SPAN. They were greeted by staff from Catholic Charities DC, a group that offers food assistance, medical care, job training and English lessons, a spokesperson told HuffPost. Five of the immigrants told CNN they were from Venezuela and had arrived at the southern U.S. border on Sunday, where they were processed by authorities and released while their immigration claims worked their way through the court system. Their bus ride took roughly 30 hours, they said, with food and water provided along the route. Abbott’s office noted that other migrants on the first bus had also come from Colombia, Cuba and Nicaragua. A second bus is en route. Texas Governor @GregAbbott_TX carries out his pledge to transport illegal migrants to Washington, DC. The bus pulled up right in front of the building that houses @FoxNews , @NBCNews and ⁦@cspan⁩ pic.twitter.com/KsrP04LSuw Abbott’s office said the travel arrangements to Washington were a voluntary process in which individuals needed to show Homeland Security documentation to board a bus or plane. The Texas Division of Emergency Management was directed to coordinate their travel plans. For some of the immigrants, the bus ride helped speed their journey to where they ultimately wanted to go. One migrant, a 26-year-old mother of two from Venezuela, told The Texas Tribune that she and her small family had wanted to escape Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime and were headed to New York. “We are very thankful for all the help that has been given to us,” she told the Tribune in Spanish. But Abbott’s plan has earned scorching criticism for exploiting vulnerable individuals to make a political point. An ACLU of Texas staff attorney called Abbott’s plan “outrageous and blatantly unconstitutional” when it was first announced, while it was still unclear that the busing would be voluntary. White House press secretary Jen Psaki labeled Abbott’s plan a “publicity stunt.” Texas state Rep. Matt Shaefer, a Republican, called it a “gimmick.” Texas Democrats said Abbott was merely working “to demonize immigrants.” “For years, Texas Republicans have looked to the Southern Border as a wedge issue, creating a narrative that stirs up emotions but neglects the truth,” the Texas Democratic Party said in a Monday statement. Abbott has spoken out harshly against Biden’s stance on immigration, mischaracterizing the president’s immigration policy as one of “open borders” when not much has changed from the Trump era despite Biden’s campaign-trail promises. “As the federal government continues to turn a blind eye to the border crisis, the State of Texas will remain steadfast in our efforts to fill in the gaps and keep Texans safe,” Abbott said in his statement on Wednesday. “By busing migrants to Washington, D.C., the Biden Administration will be able to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border. Texas should not have to bear the burden of the Biden Administration’s failure to secure our border.” Biden recently announced he would rescind a policy enacted under Trump known as “Title 42” that allowed authorities to turn away asylum-seekers on the basis of public health, given the prevalence of COVID-19. Until the pandemic hit, the number of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border had been steadily increasing over the last decade, and the question of how to handle vast numbers of migrants has now reportedly divided White House advisers.

In a video that went viral, she appears to try to grab the teen as he tries to exit the hotel. The teen’s father, jazz musician Keyon Harrold, accused Ponsetto of racial profiling. Her missing phone was apparently later located in an Uber, and the driver returned it to her. In an interview with CBS after the incident, Ponsetto admitted she should have approached the situation differently, “maybe not yelled at him like that and made him feel, you know, maybe some sort of inferior way, making him feel as if I was, like, hurting his feelings.” Ponsetto is already on probation in California for a separate case. The terms of her guilty plea on Monday allow her to continue her probation and counseling.

14,Gov. Greg Abbott Says Texas Will Bus Undocumented Immigrants To D.C.,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ordered the state to start busing undocumented immigrants to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday in response to President Joe Biden’s lifting of a policy that turned away migrants because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Texans cannot continue to shoulder the burdens imposed by open-border advocates in other parts of the country,” Abbott said in his order to the Texas Division of Emergency Management, or TDEM. Migrants in Texas ― many of whom are seeking asylum in the U.S. after fleeing government corruption, violence and crime in their home countries ― will be given “voluntary transportation” to Washington and other undisclosed locations, the governor said in his directive. It’s unclear what other choices they’ll have. “We are sending them to the United States’ capital, where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border,” Abbott said at a press conference Wednesday in the border city of Weslaco. The order is among several legally dubious actions Abbott announced Wednesday to target illegal border crossings. Others include directing the state’s Department of Public Safety to start stopping and inspecting commercial vehicles coming across the U.S-Mexico border ― though that’s sure to slow traffic between Texas and its biggest trading partner ― as well as increasing military activity in South Texas and installing razor wire in more easily crossed parts of the Rio Grande. TDEM estimates the plan will require 900 charter buses to take immigrants on the approximately 30-hour bus journey to D.C. Abbott did not elaborate in his directive or his press conference on how the program will be managed or funded, and opponents quickly decried what they characterized as attention-getting antics by someone angling to run for president in 2024. “If Abbott focused on solutions instead of stunts, then Texas could have made some real progress on this issue over the last seven years,” Democrat Beto O’Rourke said in a statement. O’Rourke, a former U.S. House member, is seeking to unseat Abbott in the Texas gubernatorial race later this year. RAICES, a Texas-based organization that helps immigrants and refugees, called Abbott’s actions “disgusting.” We see what you are doing here, and it's disgusting.@GregAbbott_TX  is trying to Make Texas White Again. https://t.co/4AduW1FBQF The governor’s war on immigrants is sure to face court challenges from opponents who say he’s overstepping the federal government’s authority on immigration matters. The architects of Abbot’s plan say states have the constitutional right to defend themselves from an “invasion,” but experts say that defense is shaky. “Just because the state says that it is an invasion that doesn’t necessarily make it so, it is not clear to me what additional legal authority that conveys on them,” Emily Berman, an instructor on constitutional law at the University of Houston, told The Associated Press following Abbott’s announcement. Recent media investigations into Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star,” the moniker he’s given to his administration’s ongoing crackdown on immigration, have found that it’s both rife with corruption and ineffective at slowing border crossings into Texas. Abbott’s latest orders follow Biden’s announcement that he’s lifting a public health measure next month called Title 42. Under the Trump-era policy, the U.S. asserted the authority to block migrants from entering the country due to the risk of COVID-19 contagion. The policy has been used to turn away asylum-seekers more than 1.7 million times in the past two years, but will now expire on May 23. The Department of Homeland Security said it’s preparing for around 18,000 migrant arrivals a day once Title 42 is lifted, up significantly from this week’s average of 7,100 arrivals. Democrats have been divided on the decision to ditch the policy, with progressives championing it as long overdue and moderates saying the country wouldn’t be able to manage the sudden influx. “Title 42 was a cruel and discriminatory policy that circumvented U.S. law, preventing people from accessing protections established by Congress,” Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement following the decision. The two Democratic senators from Arizona, which also shares a border with Mexico, said they opposed the move. Sen. Mark Kelly said it’s “unacceptable to end Title 42 without a plan and coordination in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and humane process at the border.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,New York Man Facing Hate Crime Charges In Attacks On 7 Asian Women,social-justice," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost A man arrested last month in connection with a string of attacks on seven Asian women over a three-hour period in New York City has been charged with felony and misdemeanor hate crimes charges, prosecutors said Monday. Steven Zajonc, 28, was indicted on six counts of third-degree assault as a hate crime and seven counts of second-degree aggravated harassment for the Feb. 27 attacks in Manhattan. Authorities said the attacks were not provoked. In several of the attacks, Zajonc allegedly approached the women from behind and struck them in the face with a closed fist or elbow before fleeing. Their injuries included bruising and bleeding, prosecutors said, and one victim was knocked unconscious and treated at a hospital for a concussion. “These attacks on seven New York women, each fueled by anti-Asian hate, are yet another sobering reminder of the demonstrable fears [Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders] communities, particularly AAPI women, in our City continue to face,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. Zajonc, who was not listed as having an attorney, was arrested on March 2 after he barricaded himself inside of a New York Public Library in Midtown following a manhunt, NBC New York reported at the time. Anti-Asian hate crimes rose dramatically following the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The Manhattan DA’s Office said it has 27 open hate crime cases related to anti-Asian hate crimes as of Monday. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

0,COVID-19 Asylum Limits At US-Mexico Border To End May 23,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Centers for Disease Control announced Friday that it is ending a policy that limited asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The use of public health powers had been widely criticized by Democrats and immigration advocates as an excuse for the United States to shirk its obligations to provide haven to people fleeing persecution. The policy went into effect under President Donald Trump in March 2020. Since then, migrants trying to enter the U.S. have been turned away more than 1.7 million times. The policy, known as the Title 42 authority, named for a 1944 public health law to prevent communicable disease, will end on paper April 1, but it will not take effect until May 23, to allow border officials time to prepare. “After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC director has determined that an order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,” the CDC said in a statement. The decision is expected to draw more migrants to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Department of Homeland Security said this week that about 7,100 migrants were coming daily, compared with an average of about 5,900 a day in February — on pace to match or exceed highs from last year, 2019 and other peak periods. But border officials said they are planning for as many as 18,000 arrivals daily. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Asylum Limits At Border Expected To End May 23,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is expected to end the asylum limits at the U.S.-Mexico border by May 23 that were put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision, not yet final, would halt use of public health powers to absolve the United States of obligations under American law and international treaty to provide haven to people fleeing persecution. Ending the limitations in May would allow for time to prepare at the border, the people said. But the delay runs against the wishes of top Democrats and others who say COVID-19 has long been used as an excuse for the U.S. to get out of asylum obligations. It also raises the possibility that more asylum-seeking migrants will come to the border at a time when flows are already high. The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday  that about 7,100 migrants were coming daily, compared with an average of about 5,900 a day in February  and on pace to match or exceed highs from last year, 2019 and other peak periods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended its asylum-blocking powers for two months in late January, near the height of the omicron variant. The authority is up for renewal this week, but officials have not formally decided to terminate it yet and an announcement was expected over the next few days. The people familiar with the plans saw a draft report that has not been finalized and they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. The limits went into place in March 2020 under the Trump administration as coronavirus cases soared. While officials said at the time that it was a way to keep COVID-19 out of the United States, there always has been criticism that the restrictions were used as an excuse to seal the border to migrants unwanted by then-President Donald Trump. It was perhaps the broadest of Trump’s actions at the border to restrict crossings and crack down on migrants. The health order has caused migrants to be expelled from the United States more than 1.7 million times since March 2020 without a chance for them to request asylum. The limits took effect over the objections of CDC officials, and Dr. Martin Cetron of the Division of Migration and Quarantine refused the order to begin its use. He said there was no public health basis for such a drastic move, the AP reported. But then-Vice President Mike Pence ordered the CDC’s director to use the agency’s emergency powers and it went into effect. The limitations on seeking asylum became more difficult to defend on scientific grounds as mask mandates were lifted, vaccination rates climbed and COVID-19 rates dropped among migrants crossing from Mexico. President Joe Biden, who has rolled back some of Trump’s other more restrictive policies and reinstated higher asylum figures, has taken increasing criticism for keeping the policy. Homeland Security officials, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and other top Democrats were increasingly vocal about wanting to end so-called Title 42 authority, named for a 1944 public health law to prevent communicable disease. Schumer called it “perplexing that the (CDC) continues to recommend the extended use of this draconian policy at the border, contradicting the overwhelming signs of America’s pandemic recovery under President Biden’s leadership.” His comments were in a joint statement this month with Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California. Not all Democratic elected officials agreed, including some from border and swing states. Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, both Arizona Democrats, sided with Republican leaders to say Title 42 should remain until U.S. border authorities were prepared for sharp increases in new arrivals. And they’re not. Homeland Security officials said Tuesday they were planning for as many as 18,000 arrivals daily, an astounding number that they cautioned was simply to prepare for all possible outcomes, not projections. But there has been no major changes to how migrants are processed at the U.S.-Mexico border and no increase in holding facilities for them. The immigration court backlog continues to soar to more than 1.7 million cases. While there is no aggregate rate for migrants, COVID-19 test results from several major corridors for illegal border crossings suggest it is well below levels that have triggered concerns among U.S. officials. In California, 54 of 2,877 migrants tested positive in the first two weeks of March, according to the state Department of Social Services. That’s a rate of just 1.9%, down from a peak of 28.2% on Jan. 8. In Pima County, Arizona, which includes Tucson, the seven-day positivity rate among migrants didn’t exceed 1.3% in early March. The positivity rate among 5,300 migrants tested last month at the Regional Center for Border Health near Yuma, Arizona, was 0.1%. McAllen, Texas, the largest city in the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, has a higher rate among migrants — 11.3% for the week ending March 16 — but it has been consistently lower than the general population. Critics say Title 42 has been an excuse to avoid asylum obligations under U.S. law and international treaty, buying Biden time to create the “humane” asylum system that he promised during his 2020 campaign. Justin Walker, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, wrote this month in an order restricting the policy that it was “far from clear that the CDC order serves any purpose” for public health. Walker, who was appointed by Trump, noted that the Biden administration has not provided detailed evidence to support the restrictions. “The CDC’s order looks in certain respects like a relic from an era with no vaccines, scarce testing, few therapeutics, and little certainty,” Walker wrote for a three-judge panel. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted falling rates when she ended asylum limits on unaccompanied child migrants on March 11, while keeping them for adults and families with kids. In August, U.S. border authorities began testing children traveling alone in their busiest areas: Positives fell to 6% in the first week of March from a high of nearly 20% in early February. ___ Dearen reported from New York and Spagat from San Diego.

3,"New Immigration Rules Aim To Decide Us Asylum Cases In Months, Not Years",social-justice," The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled new procedures to handle asylum claims at the U.S. southern border, hoping to decide cases in months instead of years. The rules empower asylum officers to grant or deny claims, an authority that has been limited to immigration judges for people arriving at the border with Mexico. Until now, asylum officers have only done initial screenings for asylum and other forms of humanitarian relief for border arrivals. The change could have far-reaching impact, but administration officials said they will start slowly and without additional resources. It will take effect 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, which will occur next week. The administration estimated last year that it would need to hire 800 more employees for asylum officers to handle about 75,000 cases a year. Without more money and new positions, it is unclear how much impact the move will have at first. The United States has been the world’s most popular destination for asylum-seekers since 2017, according to the U.N. refugee agency, putting enormous strain on immigration courts. The court backlog has soared to nearly 1.7 million cases. “The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department includes asylum officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the new procedures will ease burdens on immigration courts, which are part of the Justice Department. Asylum claims for people who are not detained take an average of nearly four years to decide. “This rule advances our efforts to ensure that asylum claims are processed fairly, expeditiously and consistent with due process,” Garland said. Under the new rules, asylum officers expect to decide cases in 90 days. Rejected applicants will be sent to immigration judges, who also expect to issue decisions in 90 days. Judges will be able to complete cases faster with detailed documentation from asylum officers, officials said. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, said the change will move asylum seekers so quickly through the immigration courts that they probably won’t be able to get lawyers in time and will likely have to represent themselves. “These timelines are punishing, brutal, and will almost certainly prevent the vast majority of asylum seekers going through this system from being able to obtain lawyers,” he wrote on Twitter. The new procedures, which generated more than 5,300 public comments after they were proposed in August, may face legal obstacles. Many changes to the immigration system during the Trump and Biden administrations have been successfully challenged, delayed or modified in courts. ___ Taxin reported from Los Angeles, and Spagat reported from San Diego.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Video taken by another student and posted to social media shows the white teen, a ninth grader, throwing cotton balls at the Black student, who is sitting at a table in a crowded cafeteria. The white student then strikes the Black student four times with what appears to be a small belt, The New York Times reported. The Black student then jumps up from his seat and pushes the other student away.

13,Deportation Agents Are Using An App To Monitor Immigrants,social-justice," LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. authorities have broadly expanded the use of a smartphone app during the coronavirus pandemic to ensure immigrants released from detention will attend deportation hearings, a requirement that advocates say violates their privacy and makes them feel they’re not free. More than 125,000 people — many of them stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border — are now compelled to install the app known as SmartLink on their phones, up from around 5,000 less than three years ago. It allows officials to easily check on them by requiring the immigrants to send a selfie or make or receive a phone call when asked. Although the technology is less cumbersome than an ankle monitor, advocates say tethering immigrants to the app is unfair considering many have paid bond to get out of U.S. detention facilities while their cases churn through the country’s backlogged immigration courts. Immigration proceedings are administrative, not criminal, and the overwhelming majority of people with cases before the courts aren’t detained. Advocates said they’re concerned about how the U.S. government might use data culled from the app on immigrants’ whereabouts and contacts to round up and arrest others on immigration violations. “It’s kind of been shocking how just in a couple of years it has exploded so quickly and is now being used so much and everywhere,” said Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign director for the Latino rights organization Mijente. “It’s making it much easier for the government to track a larger number of people.” The use of the app by Immigration and Customs Enforcement soared during the pandemic, when many government services went online. It continued to grow as President Joe Biden called on the Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. His administration has also voiced support for so-called alternatives to detention to ensure immigrants attend required appointments such as immigration court hearings. Meanwhile, the number of cases before the long-backlogged U.S. immigration court system has soared to 1.6 million. Immigrants often must wait for years to get a hearing before a judge who will determine whether they can stay in the country legally or should be deported. Since the pandemic, U.S. immigration authorities have reduced the number of immigrants in detention facilities and touted detention alternatives such as the app. The SmartLink app comes from BI Inc, a Boulder, Colorado-based subsidiary of private prison company The GEO Group. GEO, which runs immigration detention facilities for ICE under other contracts, declined to comment on the app. Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, declined to answer questions about the app, but said in a statement that detention alternatives “are an effective method of tracking noncitizens released from DHS custody who are awaiting their immigration proceedings.” In recent congressional testimony, agency officials wrote that the SmartLink app is also cheaper than detention: it costs about $4.36 a day to put a person on a detention alternative and more than $140 a day to hold someone in a facility, agency budget estimates show. Advocates say immigrants who spent months in detention facilities and were released on bond are being placed on the app when they go to an initial meeting with a deportation officer, and so are parents and children seeking asylum on the southwest border. Initially, SmartLink was seen as a less intensive alternative to ankle monitors for immigrants who had been detained and released, but is now being used widely on immigrants with no criminal history and who have not been detained at all, said Julie Mao, deputy director of the immigrant rights group Just Futures. Previously, immigrants often only attended periodic check ins at agency offices. “We’re very concerned that that is going to be used as the excessive standard for everyone who’s in the immigration system,” Mao said. While most people attend their immigration court hearings, some do skip out. In those cases, immigration judges issue deportation orders in the immigrants’ absence, and deportation agents are tasked with trying to find them and return them to their countries. During the 2018 fiscal year, about a quarter of immigration judges’ case decisions were deportation orders for people who missed court, court data shows. Advocates questioned whether monitoring systems matter in these cases, noting someone who wants to avoid court will stop checking in with deportation officers, trash their phone and move, whether on SmartLink or not. They said they’re concerned that deportation agents could be tracking immigrants through SmartLink more than they are aware, just as commercial apps tap into location data on people’s phones. In the criminal justice system, law enforcement agencies are using similar apps for defendants awaiting trial or serving sentences. Robert Magaletta, chief executive of Louisiana-based Shadowtrack Technologies, said the technology doesn’t continually track defendants but records their locations at check ins, and that the company offers a separate, full-time tracking service to law enforcement agencies using tamperproof watches. In a 2019 Congressional Research Service report, ICE said the app wasn’t continually monitoring immigrants. But advocates said even quick snapshots of people’s locations during check ins could be used to track down friends and coworkers who lack proper immigration authorization. They noted immigration investigators pulled GPS data from the ankle monitors of Mississippi poultry plant workers to help build a case for a large workplace raid. For immigrants released from detention with ankle monitors that irritate the skin and beep loudly at times, the app is an improvement, said Mackenzie Mackins, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles. It’s less painful and more discreet, she said, adding the ankle monitors made her clients feel they were viewed by others as criminals. But SmartLink can be stressful for immigrants who came to the U.S. fleeing persecution in their countries, and for those who fear a technological glitch could lead to a missed check in. Rosanne Flores, a paralegal at Hilf and Hilf in Troy, Michigan, said she recently fielded panicked calls from clients because the app wasn’t working. They wound up having to report in person to immigration agents’ offices instead. “I see the agony it causes the clients,” Flores said. “My heart goes out to them.” ___ Taxin reported from Orange County, California.

14,‘F**kin’ Duh!′ John Oliver Thinks You’ll ‘Scream At Your TV’ After Seeing This,social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver said on Sunday that TV shows have fed a big myth about justice in the United States, and that’s the notion that the appeals process can fix wrongful decisions. The reality is quite different. Or as Oliver put it, the system is “fundamentally fucked,” with wrongfully convicted people languishing in prison. “It really feels like our system is essentially guilty until proven rich or lucky,” Oliver said after highlighting some of the most egregious cases. “And that has to change, because we cannot keep letting the most vulnerable be casualties of a system that cares more about quick and final decisions than actually correct ones.” In one clip played by Oliver from “The Innocence Files” on Netflix, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner ― who has worked to free the wrongfully convicted, especially in cases involving police misconduct ― said justice means ensuring the guilty don’t walk free and that the innocent aren’t locked up instead. “That ain’t right,” he said. “I mean, duh!” Oliver agreed. “Yeah, he’s right: Fuckin’ duh!” Oliver said. “You’ve probably already been screaming that at your TV for the last 15 minutes.” And that was before he got to what may have been his most outrageous example: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

0,"For Asian Americans, Pandemic ‘New Normal’ Means Continuing To Face Attacks",social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, the wave of anti-Asian racism and violence that began in early 2020 has shown no signs of abating. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of advocacy organizations and scholars, has been compiling a database of self-reported anti-Asian incidents nationwide since March 2020. The coalition has now recorded 10,905 reports of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans, according to its latest report, released Thursday, which includes incidents that occurred between March 2020 and December 2021. “This is a really challenging time for our community. Even with hopes that the pandemic will be behind us, we know that these fears that our communities have, the suffering, the pain, needs attention,” said Cynthia Choi, the co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action and one of Stop AAPI Hate’s co-founders. “We need more support for healing, for recovery, for joy, and to work towards efforts that are really going to bring about meaningful change, both within our communities and across communities, too.” Asian Americans know this is not a new story, and many of the trends outlined in Stop AAPI Hate’s newest report have been all too familiar. For instance, the data suggests women are about twice as likely to be targeted as men: Sixty-two percent of the reported incidents involved AAPI women, while 31% involved men, 3% involved nonbinary people, and 4% were unspecified. For every incident that makes headlines, such as a recent spate of deadly assaults in New York, so many others go unnoticed or unreported. The true number of incidents is likely far higher, given that Stop AAPI Hate’s data is self-reported. According to the report, verbal harassment continues to be the most commonly reported type of incident (63%), followed by physical assault (16.2%), the avoidance or shunning of AAPI people (16.1%), and civil rights violations (11.5%), including workplace or housing discrimination and being refused service or barred from public transportation. For the first time, the group’s gender breakdowns of the incident reports included nonbinary AAPI people. Stop AAPI Hate found incidents involving nonbinary AAPI people are more likely to include deliberate avoidance or shunning (21.4%), being coughed at or spat on (13.9%), denial of service (8.3%) and online harassment (12.1%), compared to AAPI women and men. Some of the most high-profile incidents of anti-Asian racism have been hate crimes, and policymakers and leaders have often responded to these incidents with calls for more law enforcement involvement. But for many kinds of attacks, like being harassed in a public space, more policing or criminalization is not the answer and will only cause further harm, as Choi pointed out. “We are really concerned that the immediate kind of reactive response is more law enforcement,” Choi said. “You know, even the police will say that they’re not equipped to deal with people who are having a mental health crisis. So why not have people who are equipped to do that? So I think that we have been accustomed to think about community safety in a very narrow way.” Instead, Stop AAPI Hate and other AAPI advocacy groups have called for more community-based and systemic approaches. For example, among the group’s recommendations is treating street harassment as a gender-based and public health problem, instead of just accepting it as a fact of life for women. “We as a society have essentially said: ‘Women, you’re on your own. Street harassment, there’s nothing we can do about it. Navigate the world, the decisions you make, based on the fear for your own safety,’” Choi said. “It’s incredibly important that we not just accept that this is happening. Just because it’s not criminal doesn’t mean that we don’t take it seriously and that there isn’t something that we can do.” Long-term problems require long-term solutions, such as those geared toward education and prevention. Choi said she would like to see lawmakers better engage community-based organizations that have already done the groundwork. For example, many AAPI groups are building solidarity with other communities of color and working together to combat structural racism and white supremacy, forces that too often pit communities of color against each other. In New York and California, legislators recently enacted state budgets that include millions of dollars in funding for community-based AAPI community organizations, such as those that provide culturally specific and language-specific legal, health and mental health services. Choi hopes more state lawmakers start to take this kind of approach. “We would really appreciate lawmakers working with community-based organizations that are on the front lines, who understand the needs of our community the best,” Choi said. “And we have been consistently calling for, along with our partners within the movement, to recognize that even though the focus has been on interpersonal forms of hate, that it’s a systemic problem, and so we need to have systemic actions.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
1,3 House Republicans Vote Against Making Lynching A Hate Crime,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Three Republicans in the U.S. House were the only votes against a bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime. The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, named after a 14-year-old Black boy beaten and lynched in Mississippi in 1955, passed the House with an overwhelming vote of support, 422-3, on Monday. The bill would make lynching a federal hate crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison. The only three representatives to vote against the bill were Republicans Andrew Clyde (Ga.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Chip Roy (Texas). In a series of tweets, Massie explained he voted against the bill in part because “passing this legislation falsely implies that lynching someone does not already constitute criminal activity.” The bill doesn’t imply that. Instead, it gives federal authorities the power to prosecute lynchings as hate crimes. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who authored the bill, said he was 8 years old when he saw a photograph of a dead and brutalized Till. The experience “shaped my consciousness as a Black man in America, changed the course of my life, and changed our nation,” Rush said in a statement. Rush cited the 2020 killing of Black man Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia as an example of a modern-day lynching. Arbery was 25 years old when he went for a jog and was chased and shot to death. Three white men were convicted of federal hate crime charges last month in his killing. “The House today has sent a resounding message that our nation is finally reckoning with one of the darkest and most horrific periods of our history, and that we are morally and legally committed to changing course,” Rush said. The bill will now go to the Senate, where it is expected to pass. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Nigerian Government Condemns Racist Treatment Of Africans Fleeing Ukraine,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost As hundreds of thousands of people escape Ukraine amid Russia’s attack on its soil, Africans fleeing the violence have reported facing racist, disparate treatment compared to white Ukrainians. On Monday, the Nigerian government called out the “unfortunate reports” of Ukrainian police “refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains” headed toward Ukraine’s border with Poland. With around 4,000 Nigerians, mostly students, “stranded” in Ukraine, the Nigerian government said, there have been reports of Polish officials refusing Africans entry into Poland. “It is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour,” Nigeria’s presidential office and residence said in a statement on Twitter. “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.” South Africa’s head of public diplomacy echoed similar concerns that South African students and other Africans “have been badly treated” at Ukraine’s border with Poland. The South African foreign office official shared a video of a woman at a Ukrainian border town saying Africans waiting to cross were being “pushed,” “shoved” and “denied access,” forced to wait in the cold as Ukrainians got “special treatment.” SA students & other Africans have been badly treated at the #Ukrain/Poland border. 🇿🇦 Amb J Mngomezulu has driven from Warsaw (5 hours) to go deal with the matter, receive our nationals & offer further support. 🇿🇦 Amb G Tsengiwe in Hungary is also attending to SANs on his side. pic.twitter.com/e2IFBrkzdb One Nigerian man, identified only as Isaac, told BBC News that Africans were being “chased back” and hit by police “armed with sticks,” and said border officials had told them they were “not tending to Africans.” Another Nigerian, Osemen, told the news outlet that only Ukrainians were being permitted to board a train in Lviv to the border with Poland. A group of Congolese students told Canada’s CTV News that Africans were being “put aside” until border guards processed Ukrainians, and were told that “Ukrainians go first.” Responding to the reports of disparate treatment, the Polish embassy in Nigeria said in a statement Saturday that “all nationals are given equal treatment and none are discriminated against,” adding that Nigerians were “among those” who’d been able to cross into Poland “in recent days.” The Polish government in Nigeria added that the situation at the border is “becoming increasingly challenging” and that it takes “longer with each passing day” to get through. Tens of thousands of African students have been studying in Ukraine, according to Reuters. Over 500,000 people have fled the country since Russia attacked last week, the United Nations said. The U.S. civil rights group the NAACP released a statement Monday condemning the mistreatment of Black people seeking to flee Ukraine, saying: “As history has taught us, whenever there is a crisis, Black and brown communities will feel the effects first and be provided with aid last.” “Black families, immigrants… are not only facing challenges to evacuate a deadly warzone but are being pushed from trains and beaten by police officers,” the NAACP said. “These callous acts are atrocious and reprehensible… Every individual must be treated with dignity and humanity.” Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Bomb Threats Rattle More Historically Black Schools Amid FBI Investigation,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Three more historically Black colleges and universities faced bomb threats Friday morning, just two days after the FBI described the ongoing rash of incidents as “violent extremism and hate crimes.” New Orleans’ Dillard University, North Carolina’s Elizabeth City State University and Virginia’s Norfolk State University ― all HBCUs ― either asked people to shelter in place or asked them to clear the campus Friday amid new bomb threats. As of Friday afternoon, officials had given the all-clear at Norfolk. Not a week of Black History Month this year has gone by without bomb threats at HBCUs. And earlier this week, the FBI said it had tallied 57 bomb threats at HBCUs and other Black gathering spaces between Jan. 4 and Feb. 16. “This investigation is of the highest priority for the Bureau and involves 31 FBI field offices that are actively working with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to identify those involved,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday. “The FBI is investigating these cases as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes.” Though no explosives related to the threats have been found, the FBI said it recognizes “the fear and disruption this has caused across the country.” Several of the bomb scares have occurred at HBCUs within the University of North Carolina system, whose president on Friday called the threats a reminder of “the barriers that too many of our students still face on the path to higher education.” Statement from UNC System President Peter Hans: pic.twitter.com/KYJzLArtAT Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also spoke out Friday, saying he’s “extremely disturbed by the continuing bomb threats against HBCUs.” There are more than 100 accredited HBCUs across the country. Though they enroll students of all races, Black students account for about three quarters of their enrollment. Earlier this month, media reports circulated that the FBI had identified six “tech savvy” juveniles as persons of interest in HBCU bomb threats. But the agency said this week that it’s still unable to share any details about the investigation. Several HBCU officials and civil rights groups testified before a congressional committee last week about the ongoing bomb threats, saying the response must go beyond an FBI investigation. There must be a “commitment to fund research and prevention initiatives to address hate and long-term contributors to extremism,” Southern Poverty Law Center President Margaret Huang said. She described the need for lawmakers to condemn actions against HBCUs, address the growing threat of white supremacy movements and invest in countering the spread of misinformation. “We cannot allow white supremacy, racism and bigotry to prevent our treasured HBCUs from being safe spaces where students can learn and grow,” Huang said.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,3 Men Convicted Of Hate Crime Charges In Murder Of Ahmaud Arbery,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter Three men were convicted of hate crime charges in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery after a federal trial in which the government argued that they were motivated by racism when they fatally shot Arbery in February 2020. Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan were also convicted of attempted kidnapping charges stemming from the murder. Additionally, Travis McMichael was found guilty of brandishing and firing a firearm. Gregory McMichael was also found guilty of brandishing a firearm. The jury of eight white people, three Black people and one Hispanic person came to an unanimous decision on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Brunswick, Georgia. Jurors began deliberating on Monday after prosecutors and the defense gave their closing arguments. Prosecutors ended Monday’s closing statements arguing the three men, who are all white, associated Arbery’s “Black skin with criminality” when he was killed in broad daylight. “They didn’t just make racial assumptions, they made racial decisions,” Christopher Perras, a special litigation counsel for the Department of Justice’s civil rights division, said. On Feb. 1, U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood denied plea agreements reached between Gregory and Travis McMichael and the Department of Justice. The McMichaels would have avoided a federal hate crimes trial. Instead, they would have been able to serve their first 30 years of their life sentence from the state murder in federal prison, where they would have avoided Georgia’s state prison conditions. The plea agreements had no mention of Bryan. Throughout the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of racist statements made by Travis McMichael, the man who fatally shot Arbery, in the years and months before Arbery was murdered. Amy Vaughn, an FBI intelligence analyst, testified about text messages where Travis McMichael made several racist comments toward Black people, as well as comments he made to friends on social media. Travis McMichael referred to Black people as “subhuman savages” and responded to a video of a Black person with a firecracker saying he wished it blew “that f**king n****r’s head off.” Prosecutors also displayed evidence of Bryan using racial slurs and condemning his daughter for dating a Black man. In one instance, Bryan said that his daughter has her a “n****r now,” and that the relationship had been causing strife between him and his daughter. The racist messages and statements made by the men were key evidence throughout the trial, a stark contrast compared to the state murder trial that focused on whether or not the men committed murder when they killed Arbery. All three men were convicted of felony murder in November and they were sentenced to life in prison in January. Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. In 2020, Arbery’s killing sparked mass protests for months in major cities across America. A video recorded by Bryan that showed the murder spread throughout social media, sparking outrage. The jury’s verdict comes just a day before the two-year anniversary of Arbery’s murder on Feb. 23, 2020. Prominent civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump released a statement on unanimous decision made by jurors on Tuesday. “Tomorrow marks two years since Ahmaud Arbery was stalked, trapped, and murdered in cold blood as he jogged through his Brunswick neighborhood. And today, after much sorrow, grief, and pain, Ahmaud’s family can finally put this chapter behind them. For the last 24 months, they’ve dedicated themselves to getting justice for their son,” Crump said in a statement. “They’ve had to relive his brutal murder, watch and listen as he was demonized in court, and fight to share with the world who Ahmaud Arbery was and who he could have been had his young life not been so violently cut short.” Crump went on to add that there was never any “doubt” that the McMichaels and Bryan chased and killed Arbery because he was Black. He said the prosecution “revealed to the world” what their views were through text messages, testimony and video evidence. “Ahmaud Arbery was denied the opportunity to define his own legacy, but America, we have the power to ensure that it is one that propels our fight for equal justice and dispels hate from this world. That is how we continue to honor Ahmaud and make sure his death was not in vain.” Social Justice Reporter Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"DOJ, Defense, Rests Its Case In Hate Crimes Trial Of Men Who Killed Ahmaud Arbery",social-justice," Social Justice Reporter The prosecution and defense both rested Friday in the trial of the three white men charged with a federal hate crime in the murder of Black 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery. U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood dismissed jurors, who are slated to hear closing arguments Monday in the trial of Greg and Travis McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan. The jury will begin deliberations once final arguments are made. Travis McMichael’s former supervisor Joe Mandela testified Friday that he received a call from McMichael on Feb. 23, 2020, the day Arbery was fatally shot. McMichael, who was working as a government contractor for Metson Marine at the time, told Mandela that he had shot and killed someone who was doing break-ins. Mandela testified that McMichael, 36, told him he had shot Arbery, 25, in self-defense and that he was not being charged in the shooting. After the video surfaced showing McMichael fatally shooting Arbery at close range, Mandela said he was “upset” and alerted their employer about the video. McMichael’s security badge was then taken away. A woman who served in the Coast Guard with McMichael said he referred to her as a “n****r lover” because she dated a Black man. She also said he had made sexually lewd comments toward her. During their opening arguments, which began Monday, prosecutors presented evidence that Travis McMichael and Bryan had an extensive history of using racial slurs and making racist comments toward Black people. The government argued Arbery was chased down and killed because of the “color of his skin.” Throughout the week, prosecutors presented 19 different witnesses, including Amy Vaughn, an FBI agent who obtained messages from the phones of McMichael and Bryan. Vaughn detailed several instances dating back to 2019 in which Travis McMichael made racist comments about Black people in private text messages and in comments on social media. In one instance, McMichael described Black people as “subhuman savages.” In another, he responded to a friend’s Facebook post by saying he wished a firecracker “blew that n****rs head off.” Bryan’s history of racist comments included messages in which he expressed disapproval of his daughter dating a Black man. “She’s got her a n***** now,” Bryan, 52, said in private messages. Arbery was gunned down while running near a construction site in the neighborhood of Satilla Shores, Georgia. Bryan, Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory McMichael, chased Arbery while driving two different pickup trucks. The younger McMichael shot and killed Arbery at close range during the pursuit. In the state murder trial, prosecutors argued that the McMichaels and Bryan made “drive-way decisions” that factored into the killing of Arbery. All three men were convicted of felony murder. They were sentenced to life in prison in January. Only Bryan’s sentence offers the possibility of parole. The defense did not bring any witnesses forward for Travis McMichael or Bryan. One witness was brought forward on behalf of Gregory McMichael, 65. The McMichaels and Bryan are all charged with a hate crime violating Arbery’s civil rights and face attempted kidnapping charges.

12,Afghans Evacuated To The U.S. Are Living In Limbo. Here’s How Congress Could Help.,social-justice," Afghan Fellow, HuffPost Last August, human rights activist Zarlasht Haidary was among the lucky few vulnerable Afghans who were airlifted out of the country before the last U.S. troops departed. Her activism made her a target for the Taliban, so she chose to leave despite the knowledge that she could live in limbo for months, years — possibly a lifetime. She had been displaced before, after fleeing Afghanistan when the Taliban took power in 1996 when she was just 6 years old. “As a kid, I barely grasped what we went through ... but what I grew up to realize is that that country had never been our home, and we were never welcomed there as Afghan immigrants,” she said in an interview from Boston, where she is currently living. “Now everything is happening all over again, only I feel the gravity of it this time.” More than 76,000 Afghans have arrived in the U.S. in this wave of evacuations, while thousands more are waiting in bases and refugee facilities in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates with the expectation that they will be relocated to the U.S. in the coming months. But many of those Afghans don’t know what happens next, because they are arriving under what is known as humanitarian parole status. Like Zarlasht, they will only be authorized to live and work in the U.S. for two years and receive resettlement benefits for a few months. Humanitarian parole allows temporary lawful presence in the United States but does not create a path to lawful permanent residence. “I am not sure what comes next, and I cannot think of any long-term plan now,” she told HuffPost. According to a recent Department of Homeland Security report, 36,821 Afghan evacuees living in the U.S. have no clear route to permanent legal status. They do not qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa, or SIV, program for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government. Even for those eligible for Special Immigrant Visas, it could take years to get a green card due to a backlog of applications. Afghans and civil society groups are calling for an urgent fix, asking lawmakers to introduce and pass legislation creating a pathway for Afghans here on humanitarian parole to gain lawful permanent residence status — essentially, a green card. No such bill yet exists in Congress, though groups have floated the idea of an Afghan Adjustment Act. “Every day our staff receives calls from Afghan parolees anxious about their prospects of remaining on safety of American soil,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, at a press conference on Capitol Hill this week. “They worry about how they could possibly find and afford a lawyer to navigate a deeply complex asylum system, and they are justifiably terrified at the possibility of being returned to the same peril they narrowly escaped just six months ago.” Vignarajah said this legal limbo is creating an “unwarranted source of stress and sleepless nights for our new Afghan neighbors” and making resettlement and integration more difficult. “Humanitarian parole was only the best option for the Biden administration to get a large number of people out very quickly,” said Bilal Askary, an Afghan American advocate who works with Welcome with Dignity, a campaign that advocates for refugees’ rights. “It does not guarantee the fate of recently arrived Afghans in America.” While Congress has authorized $13.3 billion to resettle Afghans, advocates are hoping Congress will take action to make it possible for evacuees to get green cards. Two congressional aides told HuffPost the idea is gaining traction on Capitol Hill. But one noted that Democratic leadership in the House and Senate will make a final call on whether to push for it and may be wary of doing so ahead of this year’s midterm elections. “Now Republicans are starting to more openly freak out about bringing refugees into the country,” the aide said. The proposed act would give Afghans an additional opportunity to stay in the U.S. beyond the current SIV, asylum and priority refugee processes, said Chris Purdy, director of Veterans for American Ideals and Outreach at Human Rights First. “Those pathways take a long time. An Afghan Adjustment Act would allow every Afghan that is here to become a legal permanent resident after a year by skipping those pathways,” he added. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a backlog of 412,000 pending applications for asylum, according to a 2021 report. Purdy estimated that around 40,000 SIV applications are pending, which is “more than double the 18,000 a year ago.” Some advocacy groups are also promoting the idea of offering Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to recently arrived Afghans, another designation the government can give on a country-by-country basis if conditions in a particular nation temporarily make it unsafe or impossible to return there. Purdy said that would be helpful, but it is not permanent. In at least three similar instances, Congress has created pathways for people fleeing war or unrest to stay in the U.S.: for Cubans in 1966, Southeast Asians in the 1970s and Iraqis after the U.S. invasion in 2003. Discussions among lawmakers are “at a member-to-member level,” Purdy said. “We have had hundreds of meetings with officials on both sides of the aisle. Republicans clearly want to get this done; there are questions that they have to have answered.” Supporters of the idea say it would prevent further chaos and benefit countless desperate people. “If we fail them again, they’re going to be homeless on our streets this time.” Matt Zeller, a U.S. Army veteran, author and senior adviser to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said at the press conference. Purdy noted that by granting special status to Afghans already in the U.S., Congress could free up resources to evacuate others in Afghanistan who are still at risk: “For every case that we do not do here in the United States on SIV, we could use that case on someone in Afghanistan and get them out.” The view of the Biden administration — which is currently facing flak for its approach to Afghanistan’s ongoing crisis — remains unclear. “We’ve had very encouraging conversations with the White House on this,” Purdy said. “They want to see Afghans put on a pathway so they’re not languishing in a temporary status or in a backlog for years. But they have got to do something big and positive, and so this would be a great opportunity for them to come out and support this in a robust way rather than just private conversations.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

13,Jury Hears Evidence Of Racial Slurs During Hate Crimes Trial Of Ahmaud Arbery's Killers,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter Travis McMichael and William Bryan, two of the three men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery in 2020, used several racial slurs about Black people, including in the days leading up to Arbery’s death, an FBI analyst testified in federal court Wednesday. FBI agent Amy Vaughn said that McMichael shared several racist messages with friends as far back as 2019, adding detail to the claims made by prosecutors in opening statements of the federal hate crimes trial on Monday. Vaughn is the fifth witness to testify in the trial, in which the government aims to prove that Arbery’s death met the legal definition of a hate crime. The FBI has reviewed McMichael and Bryan’s cellphones. Gregory McMichael, Travis’ father and the third man convicted in the killing, also had information from his iCloud taken by agents. Greg McMichael’s phone was encrypted, according to Vaughn. The government showed jurors messages from Travis McMichael’s phone beginning in March 2019. McMichael asked a friend, identified as H.B., where they “ended up last night.” H.B. wrote back: “n*****s everywhere.” “Damn. They ruin everything,” McMichael replied. “That’s why I love what I do. Not a n****r in sight.” “Ha ha ha,” H.B. wrote. “What do you do?” McMichael described himself as a “government contractor driving boats for Navy & Marines.” He added: “Love it. Zero n*****s work with me.” In another instance, McMichael was meeting someone at a Cracker Barrel in January 2019. A person identified as M.B. told him there were “hood rats” somewhere nearby. In response, McMichael said: “They need to change Cracker Barrel to N****r bucket.” In August 2019, McMichael referred to a location in Georgia as “N*****ville,” according to evidence presented at the trial. He also shared a racist song by the late singer Johnny Rebel with the n-word in its title. The song was played for jurors. On social media, prosecutors said, McMichael was just as inflammatory. Writing on Facebook, he referred to Black people as “subhuman savages,” they said. On a post shared by McMichael’s friend Derrick Thomas, describing an incident where a firecracker blew up in a Black person’s face, McMichael wrote that he wished the explosion blew “that n****r’s head off.” In comments on another Facebook post, McMichael wrote that he would “kill that f*****g n****r.” At some point, McMichael told Thomas that a gun was recently stolen from his truck. According to Thomas, McMichael believed the person who stole the gun was white. However, prosecutors accused Thomas of changing his story, saying he’d previously told jurors that McMichael believed the thief was a Black person. Amy Copeland, McMichael’s attorney, argued that many of the messages lacked context because you could not hear the inflection of McMichael’s voice. Bryan also had a record of using racial slurs toward Black people, prosecutors said. In private text messages from 2020, Bryan said he’d been “working so all the n****rs” could take the day off on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Bryan did not approve of his daughter dating a Black person, according to prosecutors. In a text message, Bryan told someone: “She has her a n****r now. I’ve been calling it for a while. Not surprised.” In their opening statements earlier this week, prosecutors hinted that all three men convicted of Arbery’s murder had a record of using racial slurs. Arbery was fatally shot on Feb. 23, 2020. The shooting sparked national outrage and months of protests, and accelerated a national conversation on race in America and the profiling of Black people. While the state murder trial did not explore the possibility of a racial dimension to Arbery’s killing, the federal trial is focused on whether the three white men who chased Arbery down did so out of racism. Bryan and the McMichaels are charged with attempted kidnapping and a hate crime violating Arbery’s civil rights. In November, all three men were convicted of felony murder in Arbery’s death. During the state murder trial, no evidence was presented of Bryan or Travis McMichael using racial slurs in text messages or Facebook posts. Social Justice Reporter"
14,Tom Cotton Claims Democrats Flooded Streets With Criminals By Supporting Trump Policy,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) on Wednesday accused Democrats of being insufficiently supportive of law enforcement, citing in part their backing of a prison reform bill President Donald Trump championed and signed into law in 2018. Congress approved the measure, known as the First Step Act, by huge bipartisan margins. The vote was 87-12 in the Senate, with most of Cotton’s Republican colleagues on board. But Cotton and a few other conservatives insisted the law threatened public safety. On Wednesday, amid a fight over a group of U.S. attorney nominees, Cotton called the law the “worst mistake of the Trump administration.” He attacked Democrats for voting “lock-step” in favor of its passage. Democrats quickly pointed out that Trump and other Republican senators enthusiastically backed the law, pitching it as a major criminal justice reform initiative in their appeals to win over Black voters. “The Republicans were in the majority ... Donald Trump signed it into law!” a bewildered-sounding Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) noted on the floor. The law reduced prison sentences for some federal inmates whom federal prison officials deemed unlikely to commit future crimes. It also allowed inmates currently serving time for crack cocaine offenses to petition courts for an earlier release, correcting for the disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine. The floor fight boiled over after Cotton placed a hold on eight of President Joe Biden’s U.S. attorney nominees, who would serve as top law enforcement officials around the country. The Senate typically confirms U.S. attorney nominees via voice vote. It last required cloture on a U.S. attorney nominee in 1993 and last held a roll call vote on such a nominee in 1975. But Cotton has sought to maximize his leverage in the Democratic-controlled Senate by objecting to quick confirmation of U.S. attorney nominees. Without agreement from all 100 senators, Democrats would need to hold a recorded vote on each nominee, burning precious floor time in the process. “I will not agree to fast-track political nominees to the department when the department is hanging out to dry career law enforcement officers,” Cotton said on the Senate floor. Cotton’s gripe was that the Justice Department had not stepped in to help defend federal law enforcement officers from lawsuits from protesters who claim they were wrongfully injured by the officers during a 2020 siege of the federal court building in Portland, Oregon. The Justice Department previously told Cotton it was helping more than 70 officers and that it had refused one request for representation. The department didn’t explain why but said that when it considers requests for legal help from a federal officer, it looks at whether the “conduct at issue fell within the scope of employment” and whether there had been wrongdoing. “Thus, there are occasionally instances where, based on a review of the facts, it is not in the interest of the United States to provide representation,” the Justice Department told Cotton in a letter earlier this month, adding that it couldn’t get into details due to confidentiality and attorney-client privilege rules. Cotton complained Wednesday that the officer denied representation, as well as three other officers who had not yet been granted representation, had not been told why they’d been left hanging ― and why they’d also been put back on unrestricted active duty. “It would be pretty strange to send them back to the special operations group with no restrictions if they engaged in some kind of misconduct in Portland,” Cotton said. But when Durbin asked if Cotton had received a privacy waiver from any of the four, meaning he’d been given permission to receive information about their cases, Cotton said he had not, so he apparently doesn’t have any official information about what happened. In December, Cotton briefly threatened to block quick confirmation for U.S. attorney nominees from states only represented by Democrats. He relented after exacting an apology from Durbin on an unrelated issue. “There were a lot of things I disagreed with [in] the Trump Justice Department ... but never once did I think about holding up the U.S. attorney of Arkansas or of Arizona or of Illinois because I disagreed with Donald Trump,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a former prosecutor, said Wednesday in a speech on the Senate floor. Cotton has embraced “tough on crime” politics more aggressively than any other Republican in Congress. Even after the Trump administration had released thousands of federal prisoners under the First Step Act and no crime wave resulted, Cotton vowed that the crimes would come. “When the law is fully implemented, yes, I believe that people who are released early from prison will go on to commit crimes,” Cotton told HuffPost in 2019. “It is almost a mathematical certainty.” Holding up the installment of U.S. attorneys across the country may undermine Cotton’s “tough on crime” stance, however. As federal prosecutors, their job is literally to go after criminals. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Prosecutors Say Ahmaud Arbery Was Killed Because Of The ‘Color Of His Skin’,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter Prosecutors said Monday that the three white men who killed Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, made “decisions about Ahmaud” based on the “color of his skin.” “At the end of the day, the evidence will prove that if Ahmaud Arbery had been white, he would have gone for a jog, checked out a cool house and made it home for supper,” Bobbi Bernstein, deputy chief of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, told jurors in opening statements of the highly anticipated federal hate crimes trial of Arbery’s killers. “They made assumptions about Ahmaud because of the color of his skin, and it would not have happened [if] he was white,” she said. Bernstein said Travis McMichael, the man who shot Arbery, had a history of using racial slurs. For example, on Jan. 2, 2020, a friend shared a video with him of a Black man lighting a firecracker. Bernstein said McMichael had responded to the friend by saying, “It would have been cooler if it blew that fucking n****r’s head off.” This was not the only time. Travis McMichael had also said he was happy that he had not worked with any Black people. In a text message with a friend, he stated that “zero n****rs work with” him and that’s why he enjoyed his job. “They ruin everything. That’s why I love what I do now, not a n****r in sight,” he said. U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood sat 12 jurors and four alternates on Friday from a pool of 64 people who were judged qualified to serve as impartial jurors following a week of questioning on their views on racism and Arbery’s murder. Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory McMichael, as well as William “Roddie” Bryan, were all convicted of felony murder in a Georgia county court in November. The three men were sentenced to life in prison in January. Bryan was granted the possibility of parole, but the McMichaels were not. Travis McMichael was not the only defendant found to have used racial slurs against Black people. In another example, Bernstein said Bryan has written a message before the shooting that his daughter was “dating a n****r now.” The case is bigger than the offensive language the defendants used, but it does provide context about Travis McMichael’s thinking when he pulled the trigger. “This case is not about racial slurs,” Bernstein said. “But you will hear lawyers talk about them and [they] will provide evidence as to why the defendant [Travis McMichael] did what he did.” While defense attorneys stated that Arbery’s killing was “an American tragedy,” they argued that the McMichaels pursued Arbery because they falsely believed he was committing burglaries in the Satilla Shores neighborhood. At the federal trial, the government is expected to contend that the McMichaels and Bryan chased and killed Arbery because he was Black, thereby violating his civil rights. The men were also charged with attempted kidnapping. The trial could last up to 12 days, according to U.S. District Judge Lisa Godbey Wood. The McMichaels initially reached plea deals with the Department of Justice, but Godbey Wood canceled the deals after Arbery’s family strongly objected to provisions that would have allowed the two men to serve their time in a federal facility instead of Georgia state prison. The day of Arbery’s murder on Feb. 23, 2020, the McMichaels chased him in a pickup truck, armed with a gun. Bryan followed, attempting to corner and cut Arbery off during the chase. Criminal charges surrounding Arbery’s killing were not filed until months later, when a video Bryan filmed surfaced, showing Travis McMichael pulling the trigger and fatally shooting Arbery. Protests erupted throughout the country and lasted for months. Arbery’s case has become a central example of America’s struggle with race — the focus of the federal hate crimes trial. In June 2020, Georgia enacted new hate crimes legislation. Social Justice Reporter"

0,Jay-Z's Partnership With The NFL Never Made Sense. It Makes Even Less Sense 3 Years Later.,social-justice," Opinion Editor The Los Angeles Rams will face off against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI on Sunday. While the game will be a battle between an aging quarterback playing for a legacy and a young gunslinger with nothing to lose, the halftime show promises to be a sprawling event of hip-hop luminaries. And, it should be, considering Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation are producing the show. For nearly three years, Roc Nation has been responsible for creating a star-studded event during the crescendo of football season. It’s the other half of the deal that Jay-Z made with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell back in 2019. And it’s often the only part people remember because it was the part that got people calling the rapper-turned-businessman a sellout. In the fall of 2019, after former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was blackballed from the NFL for protesting against police brutality, the league announced that it would be partnering with none other than Sean “Jay-Z” Carter. It was startling news considering Jay-Z had prided himself on being an anti-corporate rapper who was quick to call for a boycott. In 1999, he boycotted the Grammys after the music award show ignored DMX’s meteoric rise, including having two No. 1 albums in the same year. In 2006, Jay-Z pointed out hip-hop’s impact on luxury brands such as Cristal champagne, and when he realized that the love wasn’t mutual, he banned the high-priced alcohol from being sold at his sports lounge, 40/40 Club. “It has come to my attention that the managing director of Cristal, Frédéric Rouzaud, views the ‘hip-hop’ culture as ‘unwelcome attention,’” Jay-Z said at the time, per the wine magazine Decanter. “I view his comments as racist and will no longer support any of his products through any of my various brands, including the 40/40 Club, nor in my personal life.” Jay-Z was also known for spitting socially conscious lyrics in many of his raps. He noted the significance of former President Barack Obama’s cultural makeup in “My President is Black (Remix).” He took listeners on a ride from poverty-based behavior to making his money work for him in “The Story of OJ.” He wore a custom Kaepernick jersey during his appearance on “Saturday Night Live” in 2017. He even told the NFL to kick rocks in 2017 after the league reportedly asked him to perform during the next Super Bowl. But the rapper didn’t just tell the league no — he rapped about it afterward on “Apesh*t,” his wife Beyoncè’s song: “I said no to the Super Bowl: You need me, I don’t need you. Every night we in the end zone, tell the NFL we in stadiums too.” It was a bold lyric that put the uber elite NFL on notice. Jay-Z was essentially saying, ”I will not be your errand boy when the Black community demands better from its government. No matter what you’re offering, I already have it, so don’t expect me to help smooth things over.” It was a proud moment of togetherness during Kaepernick’s protest. This wasn’t just a rapper turning his back on the NFL; this was the biggest rapper alive telling the NFL, “I sell out the same stadiums you play in.” Then, everything changed. News outlets got word that Jay-Z and Goodell had an announcement to make, and then they laid it all on us: Jay-Z’s Roc Nation would be joining the NFL to start a social justice movement and produce halftime shows. It was a punch to the kidneys. The man who had once prided himself with making money outside of the law had sided with the opps. It was clear what the NFL got from this new union: As writer Jemele Hill pointed out in The Atlantic, “Jay-Z has given the NFL exactly what it wanted: guilt-free access to Black audiences, culture, entertainers and influencers.” But no one could figure out how the rapper benefited from changing sides. If Jay-Z sold out, then what did he gain? It was something even he had rapped about in the song “Flux Capacitor” with Jay Electronica: “Why would I sell out? I’m already rich, don’t make no sense. Got more money than Goodell, a whole NFL bench.” It’s still unclear now, almost three years after the deal was announced. But some money has been spent on social justice work. Since the merger, the NFL has created Inspire Change, the league’s social impact branch, which focuses on education and economic development, community and police relations, and criminal justice reform. The NFL has given what amounts to tax write-offs for one of the most lucrative sports industries in the world. While money is essential to any cause, it’s a hollow gesture. Think of the NFL as the rich dad who never sees his children but buys them all the toys they want. These days, the NFL is dealing with an explosive class-action lawsuit from former coach Brian Flores, who claims the NFL is racist, among many other things. It’s a league that has always been plagued with race issues. From its inception, the NFL has been considered a club for rich white guys. Almost all of its owners have been white, while 70% of the players are Black. The philanthropic arm of the NFL only seems to reach out when it realizes it has an enormous PR problem, which is what makes the Roc Nation deal so troubling: Jay-Z had to have known that he was being used, and he agreed to it — possibly to have access to a club that doesn’t want him. Since the merger, no signature piece of social justice reform has been firmly attributed to the deal between the hip-hop megastar and the NFL. There has been very little in the way of actionable items, and it’s unclear what grant partnerships Inspire Change has made with community organizations. What also seems odd is that Jay-Z has continued his own efforts to push for social justice reform. Since its founding in 2008, Roc Nation has been heavily involved in the Movement for Black Lives — making donations, leading philanthropic initiatives, and executive producing documentaries such as “Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story.” So why, then, did Jay-Z and Roc Nation need to partner with the NFL? They didn’t. Sometimes, the answer is precisely what it appears to be. No matter what Jay-Z has done in his rap career, no matter what level of success or money he’s reached, no matter how globally successful both he and his wife are, he would never have access to the club of rich white men. Yes, Jay-Z sold out Kaepernick’s movement so that he could cozy up to NFL owners. At least that’s how it looks some three years later. Some people even believe that the long game Jay-Z is playing is NFL ownership. But that won’t happen. The good old boys club is full of good old boys for a reason. NFL owners are not only wealthy; they are Republican. Most of them have donated to Republican campaigns, including that of former President Donald Trump, who not only despised players protesting during the Movement for Black Lives, but also called the mothers of Black player-protesters “bitches.” And in news that would be shocking only to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Republicans believe the NFL has already done too much for Black players, and some have started to lose interest in the NFL. A Los Angeles Times/Survey Monkey poll found that many Republicans think the NFL is doing “too much to show respect for its Black players.” They don’t want the NFL to fight racism. They like their NFL just the way it is, and for some reason, Jay-Z — the man who sold himself as the Black Dickensian street hustler-turned-businessman — wants a seat at the table, even if that means compromising the fight for Black liberation to get it.

1,"2 Of Ahmaud Arbery’s Killers Withdraw Guilty Pleas, Will Face Federal Hate Crime Trial",social-justice," Social Justice Reporter The father and son convicted of murder in the death of Ahmaud Arbery are once again facing a federal trial after they withdrew their guilty pleas to hate crime charges late Thursday and early on Friday. Earlier this week, a federal judge denied the terms of a plea agreement Travis and Gregory McMichael made with the Department of Justice, which would have transferred the McMichaels into federal prison. Arbery’s family protested the agreement, since it would have allowed the duo to avoid Georgia state prison, which is considered to have worse conditions than federal prison. “All we want is 100% justice for the Arbery family,” Marcus Arbery Sr., Ahmaud Arbery’s father, told The Associated Press on Friday. “That’s all we’re looking for.” Travis and Gregory McMichael were both found guilty of felony murder in November in Arbery’s death. A third person, William “Roddie” Bryan, was also convicted of felony murder. The three men who led the deadly chase of Arbery in the Satilla Shores neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, were all sentenced to life in prison on Jan. 7. Arbery’s family attorney, Lee Merritt, has asserted that evidence that will speak to the racial undertones and motivation for Arbery’s murder will be presented before jurors and the judge throughout the federal trial. All three men face federal hate crime charges. An indictment from the Department of Justice says the men also face kidnapping charges. Jury selection for the trial is slated for Monday.

3,Texas Butterfly Sanctuary Closes Due To 'Credible Threats' From Pro-Trump Event,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost A South Texas butterfly conservatory said it will temporarily close after being warned that it could be a target of a nearby rally headlined by conspiracy theorists and allies of former President Donald Trump. The National Butterfly Center announced Friday that it would shutter until Sunday due to “credible threats” regarding activities planned during the three-day We Stand America rally in the neighboring border town of McAllen. The closure comes one week after a right-wing congressional candidate from Virginia accused the center’s staff of being “OK with children being trafficked and raped.” The sanctuary’s director, Marianna Treviño-Wright, said she was warned by an acquaintance, former Republican state lawmaker Aaron Peña, that “she should be armed at all times or out of town this weekend” because the rally included a “Trump Train-style caravan to the border” that would likely make a stop at the butterfly center. She said she was advised that both she and the sanctuary were targets. Peña did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We simply cannot risk the safety and lives of our staff and visitors during this dangerous time,” the sanctuary said, noting that it would pay its staff during the unexpected closure. The rally will focus on border security and is set to feature former Trump administration officials Michael Flynn, a QAnon supporter who served as national security adviser, and Thomas Homan, who was an acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Other QAnon-supporting, pro-Trump personalties are also expected to attend, including Mark Finchem, the Arizona state lawmaker running for Arizona secretary of state. One right-wing group whose post was featured on the event website told supporters that “the McAllen event is not just a rally. It’s a boot camp with a full day of how-to training, to push back against and defeat the Marxists.” The National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre nature preserve located just north of the U.S.-Mexico border in Mission, Hildago County, has become an unlikely combatant in a war with Trump allies. The center’s parent group, the North American Butterfly Association, sued the Trump administration in 2017 for beginning border wall preparations without conducting the appropriate environmental assessments. The conservationists have since been embroiled in legal standoff with both the Trump administration and later with We Build The Wall, an organization that claimed to be crowdfunding private donations to build the border wall, including a section near the nature preserve. The butterfly center said We Build The Wall founder Brian Kolfage and Steve Bannon, a chief strategist in the Trump White House, attempted to boost fundraising efforts by attacking the sanctuary and Treviño-Wright with defamatory and malicious lies in late 2019 and early 2020. Both men were charged in August 2020 for allegedly using the group’s donations for personal expenses. In 2019, Kolfage assailed the butterfly park’s staff on Twitter for pushing back against his efforts to build the wall, calling them “freaks” and saying the sanctuary was a “sham.” He accused staff of ignoring human trafficking and seemed to suggest that the sanctuary’s operators might have been involved in some kind of international butterfly-smuggling scheme. In one tweet, he wrote: “The only butterflies we saw were swarming a decomposing body surrounded by tons of rotting trash left behind by illegals.” The sanctuary said it faced online harassment as a result of the posts. Police were called to the butterfly center last week after a Virginia congressional candidate, Kimberly Lowe, and her friend had an altercation with staff. Lowe is currently traveling around the southern border and sharing videos of Border Patrol, migrants being apprehended and processed, and sections of wall. She said in one video that she is learning about it so “we can save America and stop the drugs that are crossing the border and destroying our families.” According to an affidavit provided by Treviño-Wright, her son Nicholas Wright interrupted her during a conference call at around 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 21. He said that two women were trying to enter the preserve without paying admission “but wanted us to open up the gate for them to access the back 70 acres of the property, so they could go see ‘illegals crossing on rafts.’” “He said one of the women claimed to be running for Congress and the other claimed to be with the Secret Service,” Treviño-Wright wrote. Treviño-Wright said she looked up Lowe on Facebook and saw her videos from the border, then went to meet the women at reception and told them they were not welcome. “At this point they started saying things like, ‘So, you’re not about keeping the illegals out?’ and ‘you are OK with children being raped,’ and the like,” she said in her affadavit. “They continued to say things like that as they moved toward the front door.” Audio of the altercation provided and recorded by Treviño-Wright verifies this exchange, including that Lowe’s friend claimed she was a member of the Secret Service. Lowe told HuffPost she had not suggested that Treviño-Wright was “involved with anything” and accused her of making things up. She said Treviño-Wright was “mentally ill” and that she had “verbally and physically assaulted us, stole my phone, kidnapped us, and tried to keep us from leaving, and filed a false police report.” As the women stepped outside the front doors of the center, Treviño-Wright said, she noticed that Lowe was filming her and tried to stop her. She said she “panicked” because she, her children and the center had been threatened before after conservative figures posted photos of her. “I moved to stop her from doing this, by knocking or taking away her phone and retreating inside the building to wait for the police,” Treviño-Wright said. “Then I was thrown to the ground.” In the audio, a scuffle can be heard, including a woman’s voice saying, “You did not take my phone ... get the fuck down, bitch.” Lowe was livestreaming the end of the exchange to Facebook but later deleted the video. In a livestream from her car later, Lowe told viewers that “this is what you have down here at the border with crazy freakin’ people who are OK with children being trafficked and raped. I was just assaulted at the butterfly center.” Lowe’s three children were in the back seat. Treviño-Wright sent a copy of Lowe’s livestream to HuffPost. Lowe sent HuffPost the same video, but excluded the second half. Treviño-Wright said she filed a report with the Mission Police Department and submitted recordings and signed affidavits from herself and her son. The Mission Police Department, McAllen Police Department, Hildago County Sheriff and Border Patrol did not immediately return requests for comment. On Friday night, following the publication of this report, Lowe called HuffPost and said she was rejected from the We Stand America event when she arrived earlier that day, thanks to media “hit” pieces. She said she was turned away by Christie Hutcherson, the founder of Women Fighting for America, and Finchem, both of whom were advertised as attendees of a ticketed reception that included the tour to the wall. Lowe said Finchem told her that “because of me, the entire event almost got canceled.” She was told that she’d be reimbursed for her ticket. “I would have thought that the people who are supposed to be in my party would have supported me and instead they removed me,” she said. “These are pretty big bridges burned for me.” She said she was facing online harassment and abuse and had left Texas to drive back to Virginia. HuffPost has contacted Hutcherson and Finchem for comment. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"5 Years Later, Families Trump's Muslim Ban Separated Are Begging Biden For Help",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost All Naser Almuganahi wanted was to live with his wife and three daughters, together under one roof. The 32-year-old bodega owner and U.S. citizen from New York has been in immigration limbo since 2010 when he first filed for a visa for his wife in Yemen. It took nearly six years just to secure his wife, Om Alkheir Alazzar, an interview at a U.S. consulate. The November 2016 interview went smoothly, and Almuganahi was told his wife would have a visa in no time and would be able to join him in Queens. But then, days became months. Donald Trump was elected and quickly instated a ban on travel to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen. Months of waiting became years, and in May 2018, the couple finally received an update: Her visa had been denied. Even five years later, families like Almuganahi’s are still dealing with the aftermath of that policy. While President Joe Biden rescinded the final version of the ban on his first day in office last year, many families have not yet been reunited — including Almuganahi’s. Last week, more than 100 organizations sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to do more to relieve ongoing family separations, delays and a backlog that has likely deterred many people from even applying for U.S. visas. “[I]t is crucial that this administration fulfill its promise to right the wrongs of the Trump administration by providing relief to those who applied for but either never received or were denied visas that they would have qualified for but for these bans,” wrote the groups in an effort led by the No Muslim Ban Ever Campaign and the National Iranian American Council. The letter also detailed 13 policy changes the groups would like to see the Biden administration make to rectify the impact of the ban, including expediting all immigrant and non-immigrant visa applications for individuals subjected to the ban and ending extreme vetting policies for people from those impacted nations. They also asked the administration to grant entry to people who won a visa through the diversity lottery program but were not able to use it because of the ban; the program awards up to 50,000 diversity visas a year to people from countries that have low numbers of immigrants to the U.S. “We need swift and tangible action to correct the harm inflicted on our communities by Trump’s Muslim and African ban,” Linda Sarsour, the executive director of MPower Change, a Muslim advocacy group, said in a statement last week. “The time to reunite families and restore due process to those impacted is now and if the White House fails to do this, the rescindment becomes nothing more than a broken promise.” A State Department spokesperson told HuffPost on Wednesday in an emailed statement that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in “profound reductions” in the department’s visa-processing capacity. “The Department of State will continue investigating ways to creatively reduce wait times for visa interviews in collaboration with our interagency partners while ensuring a secure and efficient visa process,” the spokesperson added. “I feel like my body is here, but my mind is with my family. My family’s life is in danger and I can’t do anything.” When Almuganahi began the arduous process of petitioning for Alazzar to join him in Queens in 2010, she was pregnant with their daughter. He traveled back and forth between Yemen and the U.S. to be with them. She gave birth to another daughter in 2012, and shortly thereafter, they were able to secure American passports for their girls. All that was missing was a visa for Alazzar. They were still waiting for that when the U.S. embassy in Yemen shut down in 2015 due to the ongoing civil war. The couple had their case transferred to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. When they finally got an interview in 2016, Almuganahi flew in from New York, and his wife and children flew in from Yemen. The family thought then that the wait would finally be over. “I was really happy. I was just amazed,” he said. “I remember stepping out with my wife and hugging her. We were very excited.” Almuganahi waited in Cairo with his family for several months, checking the State Department website every morning for a status update. But with no timeline in sight, he had to return to the U.S. to work. He hoped his wife would be granted a visa sooner rather than later. But by then, Trump’s presidency was in full swing. Opponents had challenged the ban in court, and Almuganahi held out hope that their case would not be affected since it predated the ban. When the official rejection, citing the ban, came in 2018, he lost that hope. “I didn’t feel like I was a U.S. citizen,” Almuganahi said. “I looked at my passport and my daughters’ passports, and I remember giving them to [the officer] and telling him, ‘If you’re not going to treat me equally and give me my rights, then what do I need these passports for?’” Almuganahi’s older daughter, who briefly lived with him, struggled in school and begged for her mother back in Yemen, where she eventually returned. Almuganahi reached out to both his representatives in Congress and in the Senate for help, with no success. HuffPost documented 800 cases like Almuganahi’s in which the ban separated partners from spouses and parents from children. The analysis is the first of its kind and provides an in-depth glimpse into the physical, mental and economic toll of the bans, which also included medical hardships and deaths. For many of those families, the ban has caused irreparable damage. As one of his first acts as president, Biden signed the executive order ending the Trump administration travel ban. The U.S. State Department later announced that people who had been denied visas due to the ban could seek a revised decision or reapply. Last week, Ned Price, the State Department’s spokesperson, tweeted that the agency was taking additional steps “to remedy the damage of these discriminatory bans by exempting payment of immigrant visa fees for those previously refused under these policies.” Almuganahi’s hope was briefly restored, but his application entered a backlog of nearly half a million cases. Almuganahi said he doesn’t feel like his family is any closer to a solution. He has contemplated leaving the U.S. for another country where he and his family can live together. He’s not sure how much longer he can tolerate being apart, especially as the war in Yemen rages on. “I feel like my body is here, but my mind is with my family,” he said. “My family’s life is in danger and I can’t do anything. What else is in my hands to do? I’m left with no solution.” “It’s one thing to issue a proclamation that revokes the Muslim ban, but we have to undo the harms,” said Ahmed Mohamed, the legal director of the New York chapter for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who is now assisting Almuganahi with his case. “To do that, we have to bring these families together, and to make sure that we can do that is to create a process that it’s fair, that is timely, and allows these families to live together here in the United States so they could achieve the American dream as a family.” Almuganahi and his family deserve that opportunity, Mohamed said: “They’ve gone through hell under the Trump administration and they are continuing to get treated in the exact same manner as they go through the reconsideration process that the Biden administration created.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,‘Weaponized Incompetence’ Screws Women Over At Work And In Relationships,social-justice," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost “Weaponized incompetence”: It came on like a whisper on TikTok, then you couldn’t escape hearing the phrase across the app and on other social media sites. Weaponized incompetence ― or “strategic incompetence” as it’s sometimes called ― is the act of feigning incompetence at any one task (though usually an unpleasant one) to get out of doing it. When someone deploys strategic incompetence, their hope is that someone else will stare them down and say with a huff, “Fine, it’s easier for me to do it anyway!” When a woman jokingly shared her grocery list for her husband ― a list that included pictures of items and a meticulous hand-drawn map of the store ― it went viral, but for all the wrong reasons: The comment section was flooded with shouts of “weaponized incompetency.” Who can relate? 🤣 #marriedlifehumor #couple #couplecomedy #husbandandwife #husband #couplelove #foryou #tutorials #couples #wife “I literally do not find the, ‘my husband can’t properly grocery shop’ stories to be cute or funny,” one woman on Twitter said, referencing something that indeed has become a subgenre of humor on the internet. “It’s a dealbreaker to me.” In another video that made the rounds on TikTok, user @ebonie_qt reacted to a video showing a husband napping after telling his wife he’d “watch” their baby while she showered. “I never knew there was a term for [weaponized incompetency] until TikTok, I just knew I always hated seeing shit like this,” she said. “You know where the wife asks the husband to do a simple chore that she usually does on a daily frickin’ basis? And he’s either obtuse in doing it the wrong way or he’s just completely negligent and half-assing the task such as this guy right here?” #stitch with @kcrowe86 weaponized incompetence isn’t okay. #IDeserveTuitionContest #ThatCloseMessenger #parent #parenting The hashtag for “weaponized incompetence” currently has 53.5 millions views on TikTok. Conversations on the Gen-Z-beloved app have spurred more in-depth threads on Twitter and plenty of riled-up think pieces. Some women have noted that the phenomenon plays out in friendships, too, when one friend shoulders all the responsibility for group get-togethers. Some have gone so far as to link it to the orgasm gap: Men aren’t incapable of making a woman come, the thinking goes, they’re just weaponizing ignorance. Many are noting that the dynamic is ever-present in the workforce, where women or younger workers are expected to pick up the slack and finish tasks others are unwilling or conveniently “bad” at doing. Coworker: Can you figure out how to [use a feature of our very standard software] and then let me know?Me: Sure! You just need to open your web browser, type it in to google, and then follow the instructions. xx Unsurprisingly, most of the exasperation and “I feel seen” comments have been voiced by women. As a pop psychology idea, “weaponized incompetence” was bound to go viral during the pandemic, given the duress women have been under at home and in the workplace. According to a McKinsey poll conducted with LeanIn.org, since the onset of the pandemic, mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to shoulder the majority of household and parenting labor. And they’re 1.5 times more likely than dads to spend an extra three or more hours on chores and child care. “The pandemic became a breaking point for domestic inequalities in adult relationships, and viral media reactions created viral conversations,” said Sarah Spencer Northey, a marriage and family therapist based in Washington, D.C. Even before the pandemic hit the U.S., a Gallup study from early 2020 showed that even among egalitarian-minded millennial couples, it’s gender rather than the earnings of individuals that shapes the division of household labor. Husbands, boyfriends and new dads tend to fall back into their fathers’ and grandfathers’ ideas about how things get done domestically: “I’ll take care of the [relatively] few tasks that need to be done outside; you handle the inside of the house and the lion share of child care.” “On a surface level, it looks like you’re just nagging about chores to a person who ‘defers’ to your ‘competence.’ But on a deeper level, you’re experiencing not being able to trust and turn to your partner for support.” Though it’s not always purposeful ― surely, some people just can’t cook a good meal to save their lives ― it certainly can be, Northey said. At its most pernicious, the therapist thinks weaponized incompetence can come from a deep belief that doing the task is beneath the person. “It’s a passive-aggressive way of putting that labor back on the person you don’t respect enough to step up for,” she said. Pretending you don’t know how to manage basics like shopping, cooking and housekeeping is a great way to ensure that a labor imbalance that largely benefits you stays imbalanced. “The impact on a partner over time is devastating,” Northey said. “It can make you feel crazy because on a surface level it looks like you’re just nagging about chores to a person who ‘defers’ to your ‘competence.’ But on a deeper level, you’re experiencing not being able to trust and turn to your partner for support.” Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, who mostly works with men, told HuffPost he sees the relationship pattern playing out so much, he has his own term for it: “Faking incompetence.” “For instance, I worked with a man who claimed he couldn’t put diapers on his child,” he said. “They would always fall off right away so he used this as justification for why he couldn’t help his partner change diapers.” Of course, women are guilty of weaponized incompetence, too. “I’ve worked with people ― many who were women, but not all ― who’ve claimed, ‘I’m not good with numbers’ to explain why they couldn’t be a part of managing household finances,” Smith said. But by and large, it’s women who are conditioned to stare down a mess and figure it’s “easier” to just do it all themselves. Nateli De Lara, a small business owner in Oregon, has seen both her little brother and her boyfriend default to weaponized incompetence to get out of doing something unpleasant. “Personally, I believe a lot of it has to do with how someone is raised,” she told HuffPost. “When I talk to other women about it, it has to do with men being coddled by their mothers. Some say it has to do with cultures as well, and that may be the case sometimes, [but] it isn’t always; my mom is white and my husband’s mom is Latino,” she said, implying that both women experienced it. Growing up, De Lara said she was doing dishes by the age of eight and doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning the house as a preteen. Meanwhile, her 14-year-old brother still has their mother doing his laundry. He rarely washes his own dishes and never cooks for himself, claiming “he doesn’t know how to do it,” she said. When he comes to stay with De Lara and her husband, he “magically knows” how to do all that and more, she said. (She hears her brother is suddenly capable of doing “adult things” when he stays at their dad’s house every other weekend, too.) “It’s clear that my brother has figured out how to manipulate our mother, so he doesn’t have to do the task,” she said. “The sad thing is, when he finds a partner one day, he will most likely do the same thing to them.” “I would ask [my partner]  to clean the bathroom on his day off, I would come home to it not done and him saying, ‘Well you like it done a certain way, I just can’t do it.'” When De Lara moved in with her now-husband, she discovered he pulled some of the same tricks. “I would ask him to clean the bathroom on his day off and then I would come home to it not done and him saying, ‘Well you like it done a certain way, I just can’t do it,’” De Lara said. “I would try to teach him and he always ‘forgot’ how to do it.” To his credit, he’s working on it. “He really pushed back for a while, but once I started showing him other women who go through the same thing and they talk about how they feel, he started to see the issue.” A failure to wash dishes resulted in writer Matthew Fray landing a book deal. In 2016, Fray wrote a viral blog for HuffPost titled “She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By The Sink.” “[My wife] didn’t want to be my mother,” Fray wrote in the blog. “She wanted to be my partner, and she wanted me to apply all of my intelligence and learning capabilities to the logistics of managing our lives and household. She wanted me to figure out all of the things that need [to be] done and devise my own method of task management. I wish I could remember what seemed so unreasonable to me about that at the time.” Fray, whose book “This Is How Your Marriage Ends: A Hopeful Approach to Saving Relationships” is due out in March, now works as a relationship coach, helping other men course-correct before they blow up their marriages. Fray’s not entirely comfortable with the term “weaponized” because it suggests some form of manipulation, and he says most of the men he works with aren’t actively looking to cause their partners consternation. But still, he wants the men he coaches to know that shirking responsibilities time and time again will corrode your spouse’s trust in you. “In my case, it was an item of laundry on a piece of bedroom furniture,” he said. “Giving gifts that failed to consider something meaningful that she had shared with me previously. Saying or doing things in the company of others that failed to consider how she’d feel about it afterward.” Of course, these aren’t unique behaviors, he said. “They’re more or less the everyday blueprint for eroding trust with our partners and destabilizing previously healthy and functional relationships.” As Fray sees it, the problem isn’t ignorance. “A person can’t know what they don’t know. But there is something very wrong with willful ignorance. Willful ignorance is weaponized ignorance,” he said. It may have taken a pandemic to make “weaponized incompetence” go viral, but it’s something that women have discussed behind closed doors at the office for a long time, said Melanie Ho, an organizational consultant and the author of “Beyond Leaning In: Gender Equity and What Organizations Are Up Against.” “In a previous job, I had a group of female co-workers where we’d joke about our ‘gendered task of the day’ every time we did something that wasn’t an official responsibility but that women did to disproportionate extent,” she said. Like in the home, the pandemic exacerbated things. A study from LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Company suggested that women leaders and managers took on even more invisible work during the pandemic. As the researchers explained, women take necessary tasks that benefit office culture but are often seen as “office housework.” Fixing this dynamic might require helping an employee with a new baby deal with work-life challenges, ensuring that everyone’s workloads are manageable during the pandemic, or championing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Everyone has been asked to do more with less during the pandemic, but for women, there’s often an unspoken expectation that they will seek out or recognize and gratefully take on additional tasks and responsibilities, said Melody Wilding, author of “Trust Yourself” and executive coach to sensitive high-achievers. “For example, I coach a number of female leaders who have been expected to assume management of entire teams after a colleague left, without being granted a raise, promotion, or more resources,” she told HuffPost. The extra emotional labor is “unbearably draining,” Wilding said. But it’s not just the “invisible work,” like making sure a new hire gets acclimated to office life, that male employees seem to evade. Alexandra, a 30-year-old in Mexico City who used to work in the destination management industry, said she lost count of the times her bosses couldn’t get their heads around tasks that in many cases, they had originally taught her how to do. “With one boss, he’d botch the formatting for a new line item in a contract so horribly, someone always had to go in and redo the whole thing,” she told HuffPost by email. “Another boss ― also a white middle aged man ― would consistently make price adjustment mistakes, meaning someone else on the team would have to correct each individual line item, and he was the one who taught me how to adjust the prices in the first place.” In both instances, she and her co-workers eventually just gave up on the men. It was quicker to do it themselves. “We knew that we couldn’t rely on them so we just took on their work,” she wrote. “In the end that’s what weaponized incompetence is all about, manipulating others to do their work for them, except in the office you have a lot less power to confront your boss about these issues than you do at home.” “It’s simply expected that women play this caretaking role, while men can be excused as 'not good at that' and permitted to focus elsewhere.” Ho said that some women she talks to bring up something she calls “shadow management”: when a supervisor neglects to support and develop their staff, and a colleague ends up filling in the gap by assuming extra mentoring or unofficial management responsibilities. “Although this can occur with any gender, it’s more often a male manager neglecting his staff, and a female manager or other employee who’s picking up the slack,” Ho said. “It’s simply expected that women play this caretaking role, while men can be excused as ‘not good at that’ and permitted to focus elsewhere.” The easiest way to curb weaponized incompetency is to call it out ― repeatedly and without reservations or worry that you’ll hurt someone’s feelings. “You can take a different approach at different times, but don’t just accept it and be silent,” Smith said. “Too often partners ‘settle’ and ignore it to avoid conflict and frustration that comes from trying to reason with someone who’s not being reasonable.” Emphasize that all you’re looking for is effort and that you want that effort made consistently. Don’t be deterred “if they focus on their inability to do the task or claim the end product will be of poor quality,” he said. Then, take a step back and trust that your partner is fully capable, or at least capable of learning any one chore that you’ve been doing. If you’re the incompetent one, recognize that feigning ignorance or not taking the time to learn something is hurting your partner. He or she needs an adult partner — a fully capable peer, not a dependent. Truly struggling to thoroughly wash the dishes or replace your car’s air filter because no one ever taught you? “How-to” videos on YouTube are a godsend. In the grand scheme of things, completing household chores and making sure your kid gets to the doctor on time are as important for keeping the love alive as having regular dates, physical intimacy or other ways of connecting. “I’ve had a few couples where someone was highly motivated towards romantic gestures but less motivated to do chores,” Northey said. “When it was reframed as romantic and a way of showing love, it was easier to stay motivated to do it.” If there’s a certain chore you hate, it’s OK to admit it and negotiate your shared household tasks list, the therapist said. Just don’t throw in the towel and give up. “Try to think of yourself and your partner in a team or system context,” Northey said. “Less work for you does not equal less work for the team. Less work for you often nets more work for the team when you look at it from that perspective.” In the workplace, it may take a little more finesse to call attention to workload imbalances and colleagues who shirk responsibilities. Still, it’s completely doable, Ho said. Ho used the hypothetical example of a woman who, for years, has disproportionately been saddled with planning staff appreciation events. The task has been handed off to her so often, she knows how to do it like the back of her hand. “Everyone decides that she should take on the continued responsibility, rather than having her colleagues get more practice so that it becomes as second nature to them as it is to her,” Ho said. The woman’s colleagues no doubt realize it’s an easy feat for her to pull off these events. What they may not realize is how time-consuming it all still is, and that their co-worker is working an extra hour every night in the lead-up to the event, just so she can get her actual work done. When calling attention to an imbalance like that, Ho said you have to tread softly and use the framework of “intent vs. impact.” “When I’ve had discussions like this, I’ve told colleagues that I believe that their intent isn’t to take advantage of me, and they care about having an equitable workplace, but what they’re doing — their impact — isn’t matching their intent,” Ho said. “The good intent is important to recognize, but it doesn’t negate the bad impact. And so they’ve got to change that.” Then you can engage your co-workers in conversation about your current workloads and see what can be shifted around to balance the scales, Wielding said. “Practice pushing back,” she said. “If you’re asked to take on an extra task in a meeting, you might say, ‘My plate is full at the moment. Maybe someone else has the bandwidth to fit this in?’” If your colleagues don’t complete an assignment, don’t rush to fix it. “People have to face the consequence of their actions in order to change,” Wielding said. Culturally, there’s something we can do about weaponized incompetence, too: We can stop minimizing it. The internet’s tendency to laugh off woefully underdeveloped husbands is probably more harmful than we realize, Northey said. “It’s not cute or funny. It’s unfair and stressful to women,” she said. “Partners need to be talking about putting their family system back into a fair balance. And we need to stop seeing the perpetuation of power imbalances as something to endure, and instead recognize it for the very real betrayal that it is.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"
12,They Were Convicted Of Murder. Now The Men Who Killed Ahmaud Arbery Face Hate Crime Charges.,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter In November, Ahmaud Arbery’s family saw a glimpse of justice. Three men — Travis and Gregory McMichael, a father and son, and William Bryan — were all convicted for murdering the 25-year-old man in February 2020. But their quest is not over. The McMichaels and Bryan will face a hate crime trial in federal court on Feb. 7, when jury selection begins. The Department of Justice filed the charges last February, saying the McMichaels, who are white, targeted Arbery, a Black man, “because of his race and color.” They face possible life sentences. The McMichaels already received life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder, while Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. “This case is a litmus test as to where our judicial system is,” Lee Merritt, the attorney for Arbery’s family, told HuffPost. “We will have a chance to see the grisly facts and images the nation has become intimately familiar with, reconciled with the hate and ideology that motivated those actions.” The trial will be a stark difference from the state trial, where prosecutors hinted at a racial motive but never presented evidence to that effect — even though some was available, including the alleged use of racial slurs during the murder. While Glynn County prosecutors stuck strictly to the mechanical facts of whether the three men unjustly took a life, federal prosecutors will seek a more profound judgment: one that says crimes motivated by prejudice should be considered a crime against the whole country. Arbery’s death — and the subsequent long delay before charges were filed — did spark a wide conversation about how cheap Black life can be in America. “There is something so simple and tragic about a young man not even being able to run and jog in public in America,” Brian Levin, a hate crime expert and attorney, said. “It is not only the tragedy and the loss of Arbery, it was mounting to the beginnings of a lynch mob.” In Glynn County, the prosecution focused heavily on the legal standard of murder and Travis McMichael’s claim that he was simply executing a citizen’s arrest. Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, at times, made arguments that contained a slight — but never explicit — nod to racial animus on the part of the McMichaels and Bryan. “We are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions. All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions. Not on facts, not on evidence. On assumptions,” she said during opening statements. But the prosecution never introduced evidence, for example, that Bryan told law enforcement officials that Travis McMichael shouted out a racial slur toward Arbery after gunning him down, uttering, “f***ing n****r” after the shooting over Arbery’s body. Defense lawyers asked prosecutors not to ask about it in court because Bryan was the only witness of the alleged incident. The judge presiding over the case heard arguments from lawyers on Friday about racist text messages and whether they should be admitted as evidence. The content of the messages is not clear, but Bryan’s lawyer concedes they are “highly inflammatory.” He argued that disclosing the texts in court would unfairly sway Black jurors. In May 2020, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested a federal probe from the U.S. Department of Justice into Arbery’s death. In the federal indictment, the McMichaels and Bryan are all charged with attempting to “forcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will,” which resulted in the young Black man’s death. The three, also charged with kidnapping, are alleged to have restricted Arbery of his “free movement” and “corral and detain him against his will, and prevent his escape.” The hate crime charges focus on the motivations of the three men when they were chasing Arbery in broad daylight. The day Arbery was murdered was not the first time he was being chased, Merritt said. It was a reoccurring “hunt” that resulted in the death of a young Black man. This was evident in the murder trial, as the McMichaels made 911 calls about a Black male walking in and out of a construction site months before Arbery was murdered. The legal system in Georgia will also face scrutiny. Merritt said the jury on the federal trial will hear “revealing things” about what Waycross Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill “felt about Black people.” Barnhill recused himself from Arbery’s case, but not before he wrote a letter to Glynn County police arguing that the three men shouldn’t be arrested. He argued that the McMichaels were lawfully following a burglary suspect “with solid first hand probable cause.” Barnhill was the second prosecutor to touch the case of Arbery’s murder after former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because she knew Gregory McMichael. “We already had the criminality of their actions adjudicated before the court of law. The federal charges are going after the terroristic aspect of their actions and the implications they had for Black people of this country,” Merritt said. “What is on trial now is not their behavior, but their reasoning for the behavior. This is an issue that has not been taken up yet, it is an issue of first impression.” Before Arbery’s murder, Georgia was one of four states without hate crime laws on the books. But that eventually changed. Georgia enacted a hate crime statute in June 2020, months after Arbery’s death, and later repealed its citizen’s arrest statute. The legislation imposes penalties for crimes that are motivated by a person’s race, religion, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability — but the McMichaels and Bryan could not be charged under it, since the law was not in place at the time of Arbery’s murder. Forty-seven states now have hate crime statutes on the books. But bias motivations in hate crime statutes vary statewide. South Carolina, Wyoming and Arkansas are the only remaining states without hate crime laws. There are five federal hate crime statutes that federal prosecutors use when determining if a person should be charged with a hate crime. “There is a bigger picture here, which is the history of this country with Black people being killed for racist motives.” The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which was introduced under the administration of former President Barack Obama, makes it a crime for someone to be injured or assaulted with a dangerous weapon due to their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected categories. The case of James Byrd Jr. dates back to 1998. Like Arbery, Byrd had been murdered by three white men. Byrd accepted a ride from Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer and John King, all of whom were white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas. Instead of taking Byrd home during the ride, they severely beat him and chained him by his ankles, dragging him with a pickup truck. After Byrd’s lynching, Texas enacted its own hate crime law. Experts view the murder of Byrd and the enactment of the act as a pivotal moment in American history and also something that was long overdue. “I think it is noteworthy under the Shepard Byrd act, which were two other cases that captured the soul of good America at a time when we are looking at increases of racial violence,” Levin said. Arbery’s family rejected a plea deal in the federal hate crime charges on Jan. 7, even after the men were convicted of murder in Glynn County. His mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the media that the three men need to stand trial again for their brutal actions. Hate crimes against Black people jumped nearly 40% from 2019 to 2020. And 2020, the year Arbery was murdered, saw the most hate crimes in the country since 2001, according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The year Arbery was killed, protests across the country followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer as well as the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville. During this time, 61% of hate crimes showed people were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. White people comprised 55% of the perpetrators who committed hateful acts. From 2010 to 2019, hate crime numbers recorded by law enforcement increased by 10%. From 2015 to 2019, nearly half of hate crimes were motivated by anti-Black or anti-African American bias. The Department of Justice says Attorney General Merrick Garland has made confronting hate crimes a “top priority” and said it is rooted in the department’s “foundational history” of combating racial violence and protecting civil rights, according to department spokesperson Areyele Bradford. “Hate crimes impact not only specifically targeted victims, but they also instill fear across communities at large — regardless of whether they gain broader attention nationally,” Bradford said. “Consequently, the prosecution of hate crimes vindicates the rights of not only specifically targeted victims, but of larger communities as well.” Hate crime experts who have studied America’s racist and alt-right-adjacent groups over decades believe the trial will be critical. “There is a bigger picture here, which is the history of this country with Black people being killed for racist motives. That is why the hate crime charge is so important because it is also a societal reckoning. A Black man targeted because he is a Black man,” Heidi Beirich, the chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told HuffPost. “Just convicting these folks for murder is not enough for the nature of this crime.” Social Justice Reporter"
13,Smuggling Of 2 Undocumented Immigrants In Coffin Foiled By Shoddy Flag,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A man from Galveston, Texas, has pleaded guilty to smuggling two undocumented immigrants inside a damaged coffin that had been haphazardly draped with the American flag. Zachary Taylor Blood, 33, told Border Patrol officials at a checkpoint near Falfurrias on Oct. 26, 2021, that there was a “dead guy, Navy guy” inside the coffin he was transporting in the back of his van. But the agents became suspicious after spotting the “poor condition” of the crate and the American flag attached to its top with packing tape, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas Attorney’s said in a statement on Tuesday. Two men from Mexico were found concealed inside the coffin. They confessed to “paying a smuggler to get them to San Antonio,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. “They claimed that after crossing the river into the United States, they were taken to a parking lot where Blood was waiting for them. He had them get into the coffin and began driving north.” Blood pleaded guilty to one count of human smuggling. He faces five years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 fine. He’ll be sentenced on May 11. Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Trump’s Travel Ban Forever Changed The Lives Of Muslims Around The World,social-justice," . Written by Rowaida Abdelaziz | Photography by Amr Alfiky . Mohammed Saleh never got a chance to say goodbye to his son. In 2018, Saleh petitioned for a visa so his son — Ayman, who lived in Aden, Yemen, and was 20 at the time — could come to the United States to seek treatment for a congenital heart condition. He wanted to hold Ayman, take him to his doctor appointments, and give him a chance at life. That opportunity didn’t exist in Yemen, where less than half of all health facilities were functioning after years of civil war. The last time Saleh saw his son was during a visit to Yemen in June 2019. He still hoped then they could reunite in New York, where Saleh has lived for nearly three decades. But then-President Donald Trump’s ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries, issued in January 2017, meant Ayman’s visa application was delayed indefinitely. Saleh begged lawyers and advocates for help, but the ban made legal recourse all but impossible. Ayman’s application was still being processed when he died at a Yemeni hospital in May 2021, during Islam’s holy month of Ramadan. A year-long HuffPost investigation found hundreds of cases of Trump’s ban changing the lives of Muslims, both inside the United States and around the world. Families have been ripped apart. Educational and employment opportunities have been denied, maybe forever. People have missed milestones like birthdays, funerals and weddings. Some gave up on coming to the U.S. and instead relocated to another country, while others have been trapped in war zones. . . HuffPost collected data throughout 2021 on people who have been affected by the Trump-era travel ban, which included reaching out to American organizations that work with Muslim communities, putting out open calls on social media, and contacting lawyers and activists. An abridged and anonymized version of our data lives here, and our charts were built with Datawrapper. The State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs published monthly and quarterly reports after the 2017 Supreme Court ruling, which included cumulative data on versions of the ban that were implemented between Dec. 8, 2017, and Jan. 20, 2021. However, that data is somewhat limited because it does not show monthly breakdowns of denials in 2017 and 2018. . . The State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs tallied 41,876 visas denied between December 2017 and January 2021, but no single agency or organization has collected comprehensive data on how tens of thousands of people, many of whom were American Muslims, were affected. But over the last year, HuffPost collected 874 stories of people who, like Saleh, are still feeling the impact of Trump’s travel ban five years later. In an attempt to account for the ban’s far-reaching implications, HuffPost spoke to lawyers, immigration groups and advocacy organizations; interviewed dozens of families; and sifted through nearly a hundred lawsuits. These numbers are not comprehensive due to legal and practical limitations — including the fact that not all impacted individuals could or did seek legal help — but the analysis is the first of its kind and provides an in-depth glimpse into the physical, mental and economic toll of those denials. The nearly 900 cases we cataloged involve both parents being apart from their children and romantic partners being separated. In more than 100 cases, people reported medical hardship, including the inability to help a family member with a health problem and trauma, as an effect of the ban. In nearly 300 cases, or one-third of our data, the family or person impacted faced more than one extreme hardship due to the ban. There were 11 cases like Saleh’s, in which separation meant never again seeing a loved one because they died while the ban was in place. President Joe Biden signed an executive order formally ending the travel ban as one of his first acts as president, a move immigration groups and affected families applauded. And in March 2021, the U.S. State Department announced that people who had been denied visas due to the ban could seek a revised decision or reapply. But those applicants joined a backlog of nearly half a million cases and a painfully long process that the pandemic has further slowed. In January 2020, there were about 75,000 applications pending with the State Department’s National Visa Center. By February 2021, the number had increased six-fold, to 473,000. Even Biden’s reversal left out one large group of visa applicants: those awarded so-called diversity visas, which grant up to 50,000 people from countries with low levels of representation an opportunity to migrate to the U.S. through an annual lottery. Several thousand people from Muslim-majority countries who won visas were not able to use them due to the ban and aren’t allowed to use them now. They can reapply, but advocates said the chances of winning this rare opportunity again are slim. “For real people and real families, being stranded in dangerous conditions can be life and death. It means permanent emotional harm,” said Cody Wofsy, a staff attorney at the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project. “Even though the policies are now gone, you do see the effects continuing to ripple out in people’s lives for years.” One Family’s Fight Saleh came to New York, where his own father lived as a citizen, as a green card holder in 1995. Two years later, he met and married his second wife, Amina, during a trip to Yemen. Together, they had five children: Akram, Fares, Ayman, Omar and Bayen. Saleh ping-ponged between the U.S. and Yemen, but his family stayed behind. He opened a deli in Queens with his cousin and sent money to his family. Then, in 2017, his wife died of complications due to high blood pressure. His children were suddenly alone and very far away. Trump had just been sworn in as president, and quickly made good on his campaign promise of “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” On Jan. 27, 2017, just days after his inauguration, he signed a directive placing a 90-day ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. He also suspended the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. The move prompted immediate outrage. Thousands of politicians, advocates and lawyers joined protests at airports including in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas and Washington, D.C., where both immigrants and legal permanent residents were being detained. Across the globe, travelers panicked about whether they’d be able to enter the U.S. Refugees who had been booked for travel to the United States had those plans immediately canceled. A federal judge in New York temporarily blocked the order for those who had already arrived in the country or who were in transit with valid visas, ruling they couldn’t be deported after they landed. That was just the first of many rulings as immigrant and civil rights groups challenged the ban. Trump signed a new version of the ban in March 2017, which critics labeled “Muslim Ban 2.0.” It exempted anyone who already had a visa or green card and removed Iraq from the list. The 4th Circuit of Appeals upheld the lower court’s injunction that May, however, keeping the order on hold. Trump tried again in September 2017, this time removing Sudan from the list and adding Chad, North Korea, and certain members of the Venezuelan government. In June 2018, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld that version in a 5-4 decision, concluding that the president had the authority to implement the order on the basis of national security. “It was a very intense litigation up and down to the Supreme Court and courts all over the country,” Wofsy said. “Unfortunately, the Supreme Court gets the final say, and it was extremely disappointing and distressing that they blessed what everybody knew was just blatant discrimination, motivated by President Trump’s very clearly expressed anti-Muslim animus.” As the legal battles dragged on around the U.S., Saleh sought legal help to petition for visas for his children back in Yemen. He also learned that he was qualified to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, filed to move forward with that process, and gained citizenship. He hoped doing so would help make a case for his children to enter. There are several ways children of citizens born outside the country can acquire citizenship under U.S. law. Eligibility relies on several factors, including the child’s year of birth, the immigration status of both parents, and the number of years a citizen parent has resided in the U.S. Omar and Bayen qualified for U.S. citizenship, but were unable to secure visas to board a plane to the U.S. Fares and Akram were left in limbo awaiting interview appointments at the embassy in Djibouti so that they could enter as permanent residents. And Saleh’s eldest child, Khaled, was told to apply directly to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services since he was older than 21 and not eligible to apply through his father. The process for all five was long, complicated and riddled with setbacks. HuffPost’s investigation found at least 341 other cases in which parents have been separated from their children. In another 321 cases, the ban put couples on different continents for years. The impact behind these numbers is unquantifiable. Many said their lives have been permanently upended, with experiences ranging from emotional distress caused by extended separation from loved ones to loss of jobs and investments. One woman was forced to give birth to her child without her husband, a Somali national who was unable to obtain a visa due to the ban in 2018. That same year, a Yemeni American died by suicide after his wife and two eldest children were denied a visa because of the ban. Numerous students and academics said they were unable to enroll in universities to which they’d been accepted. Many couples were unable to start a family while forced apart from their spouses. Saleh remarried in 2019, to an Ethiopian woman living in Yemen. She had been a neighbor and had since taken in his children. He also petitioned for her to join him in the U.S., but entered the same precarious process. The consequences of the ban were all around him: the emptiness of his home without his children, the endless calls with lawyers and officials. He’d go to bed every night exhausted from weeping. He lived in constant fear of never seeing his family again — either because the American immigration system wouldn’t allow it or because they’d be killed by one of the bombs raining down in Yemen. Yemen was one of the world’s poorest countries even before the war began in 2014. The United Nations estimates that more than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen since then, and more than 24 million people require humanitarian assistance. The years of war have decimated the health care system, and supplies, medical care, and access to drinking water and sanitation are unstable. Treatable diseases like cholera have killed thousands of people and infected a million more. The U.S. has provided billions of dollars in weaponry and intelligence support to Saudi Arabia, which backs the Yemeni government. This has further escalated the humanitarian disaster. As the U.S. closed itself to Yemenis despite its complicity in the war, many Yemeni felt particularly betrayed. Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, said families applying for U.S. visas from conflict zones face higher levels of scrutiny. “The U.S. government highly vets immigration applications from all over the world. But that vetting can get very complicated and take a very long time for people from countries where there are greater security concerns or greater skepticism about the government’s capacity to manage records,” Gelatt said. The ban on Muslim-majority countries including Yemen and Iran further complicated the vetting process and led to more denials, she added. Permanent residence visas issued to people from Iran fell by 81% between 2016 and 2018, the first year the travel ban was fully implemented, according to MPI. For people from Yemen, the number of immigrant visas issued over that same period fell by 91%. Yasin Hassan, an immigration case manager at the Yemeni American Merchants Association in New York who has been helping Saleh with his case, said Yemenis face distinct and arduous challenges. There’s a higher burden of proof for family eligibility and aggressive interrogation techniques for routine consular services, which can result in yearslong delays. “In the eyes of the government and immigration, those systems don’t trust the population and will often question basic information,” Hassan said. “Because of that, cases have been significantly delayed.” Of the people in the HuffPost dataset whose nationalities are known, almost 15% are of Yemeni origin. In 2021, the Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status for approximately 1,700 Yemenis already in the United States due to the worsening humanitarian and economic conditions under the war, but experts have argued that Biden hasn’t done enough to end U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen. “The systems still have a lot of this discrimination at a very fundamental level, no matter what administration we have, no matter who is president,” Hassan said. “It’s about how the system functions, and sadly, I don’t think a change in administration is solely sufficient to alter that.” A One In A Million Chance Leyla Abbasnezhad, a 31-year-old Iranian, considers herself a lifelong student. Her parents are both retired elementary school teachers who always told her education was the key to success. Her mother taught her math while her father read her Persian poems and literature, and Abbasnezhad excelled at both. She enrolled at the Islamic Azad University in Mashhad, one of the largest private universities in the world with over a million students across its international campuses. Abbasnezhad earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree, graduating at the top of her class. In 2017, she enrolled in a program to earn her doctorate in biomedical engineering, in hopes of returning to the university as a professor. That same year, Abbasnezhad threw her name in the American Diversity Immigrant Visa Program lottery, hoping to immigrate to the U.S. and continue her studies. This program, established in 1990, randomly selects up to 50,000 people from countries with low levels of representation in the U.S. for a visa. Since 2005, more than 200 million people from countries around the world have applied for the program, including more than 11.8 million people during the 2021 fiscal year. During the 2018 fiscal year, the most recent available numbers to date, 115,968 lottery winners were chosen, among them only 4,500 were Iranians. Immigration from Iran saw an uptick after the revolutions of the late 1970s, but Iranians are a relatively small slice of the overall immigrant population of the U.S. Just over 12,000 of the 1 million international students in the U.S. each year come from Iran. But among those in HuffPost’s dataset, almost 40% had Iranian origins. Abbasnezhad had hoped to become one of the lucky visa winners. Her chance came in May 2017, when she received an email informing her that she had won a spot for the following year. She was assigned an interview date at the consulate in neighboring Turkey, where she planned to receive her visa and then board a plane to America. Abbasnezhad quit her Ph.D. program and bid farewell to her friends and family. She enrolled in English classes. Her family threw her a goodbye party. Abbasnezhad and her parents spent thousands on flights, hotels and fees, and headed to Ankara for her interview scheduled on Dec. 7, 2017. Armed with folders of paperwork and a single piece of luggage, Abbasnezhad was ready to begin her new life in America. But during her appointment, Abbasnezhad said embassy staff told her they could not grant her the visa due to Trump’s travel ban. They also said there was nothing she could do. She walked out of the office, overcome by tears. “I will never forget seeing my father crying. I could see how disappointed he was at that moment,” she said. A week after her interview, the embassy asked her for more paperwork, and for a moment Abbasnezhad held onto a glimmer of hope. But in January 2018, she received a formal rejection email that cited Trump’s order. The American government had offered, and then snatched back, her best chance to go to the U.S. “They gave us this hope. They gave us this dream,” she said. “They made this future possible for us in our minds and then it was all destroyed with a piece of paper.” She felt betrayed. “We just wanted to have the opportunity to come to America, and then after that, we would make it on our own,” she said. “We didn’t want anything more.” Abbasnezhad’s life spiraled. She fell into a depression. If she wanted to reenroll in her Ph.D. program, she would have to take the entrance exam again. The stress of the rejection took a toll on her health, and her hair started to fall out. She regularly broke out in hives and rashes. She has had to take medication to help with anxiety and insomnia. When Biden repealed the ban in January 2021, people across the globe celebrated. Visa applicants who had been denied due to the ban could seek adjudication without having to resubmit their applications or pay additional fees. Any previous denials due to the ban would not negatively affect new applications. But there was no recourse for those who had won a diversity visa between 2017 and 2020. Tens of thousands would have to reenter the lottery and may never get the chance to come to the U.S. Diversity visa seekers from African countries were also impacted, as Trump expanded the travel ban in 2020 to include Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. The change primarily impacted immigrant visas, specifically people seeking to reside in the United States and diversity visa seekers. Nearly 12 million people applied to the program in 2021, according to the State Department, and just 0.2% got a visa. The program also limits how many people from one country can get a diversity visa to 3,840. Last year, 759,903 Iranians applied. Organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Iranian American Council Action are lobbying the Biden administration to allow past lottery winners to obtain a visa. “The U.S. has made a commitment to offering these visas to these people who would benefit tremendously from it, only to have a kind of snatched away by a discriminatory immigration system,” said Ryan Costello, the policy director at NIAC. “So many people put their life savings on the line, quit their jobs, traveled to war zones in some cases to have this opportunity.” Legislative efforts to address the issue have also stalled in Congress. Abbasnezhad is still living in limbo. She hasn’t picked up work or school, holding out hope that Congress will honor her visa. She has joined various group chats with other diversity visa winners also following the political debates and litigation, and she checks her phone constantly. Some other members of those chats have moved on, she said, but she can’t yet. “Sometimes I think this pain will never stop,” she said. Counting Down The Days Until Reunification Saleh spent nearly three years in a similar limbo. His dark brown eyes swell up with tears as he talks about it, and his salt and pepper beard hides the wrinkles that have crept across his face. He spent nearly every day on the phone with one lawyer and consular official after another, attempting to use his limited English to battle an immigration system that seemed hellbent on keeping his family apart. In August 2021, he went back to Yemen, determined that this time he would not come back without his surviving children. It had been close to a year since Biden rescinded the ban. Saleh spent nearly $2,000 on five flights from Yemen to neighboring Djibouti, the closest country with a functioning U.S. embassy since the one in Yemen closed in 2015. For two months, Saleh and his children lived in a small apartment in Djibouti that they rented for $1,000 a month. He still spent all his time on the phone — with lawyers in the U.S., the embassy and relatives who could translate for him. Each time he visited the embassy, he was sent away with requests for more paperwork, documentation or fees. He met Yemeni families who had been waiting on American visas in Djibouti for more than a year. His family back in the U.S. begged him to return, but Saleh was not going to board a flight without his children. Finally, on Nov. 22, 2021, Saleh’s children were granted visas to enter the U.S., two as American citizens and two as permanent residents. His wife is still waiting for her visa. “We never imagined that we would leave Yemen,” said Omar, now 17. The feeling he had once he was seated on the plane with his father and siblings was nothing short of “pure happiness.” Later that month, Saleh was back at his dining room table, the only piece of furniture in the living space of a new apartment he secured for his reunited family. He wore a gray sweatshirt and hat, while the cold November wind hit his window. Omar and Bayen sat beside him. Omar placed his hand on his father’s shoulders, attempting to comfort him and remind him of his presence. Life in Yemen brought unspeakable pain, Omar said, particularly after the death of their mother and brother. Bayen had been sent to live with her grandmother, while Omar, Akram, and Fares — still just teenagers — had to fend for themselves. Omar taught himself how to cook — how else would he and his brothers eat? At one point, Omar and Fares contracted malaria and were sick for weeks, left to care for one another. Saleh’s children have seen more than most adults, having escaped death too many times for their short lifetimes. “Holding onto any hope while in Yemen was hard,” Omar said. “It felt that things got worse with each passing day.” Now he beams with pride that he can make traditional Yemeni dishes and stews for his father. He and Bayen, 15, are looking forward to enrolling in school, though they hope to master English first. Akram and Fares began taking shifts at their cousin’s deli a few blocks from their Queens home. Days after landing at John F. Kennedy Airport, Saleh took his children to Times Square. They roamed the bustling midtown, dazzled and exhilarated. They ate their first McDonald’s burgers and fries — Saleh prefers home-cooked meals, but he’s been eager to let the children try new things. As we spoke, Bayen sat quietly in her chair, seemingly overwhelmed by her new surroundings. She spoke softly among the voices of men around her. She has her father’s eyes, elongated and dark brown, that lit up when she spoke about her newfound future. “It’s stunning here,” she said, adjusting her striped hijab. Saleh, too, still seems stunned. He misses his wife and Ayman, and can’t speak about them without breaking down. The pain is too raw, he said. But with his children all sleeping under his roof for the first time in years, he started to feel a small sense of stability. “They have a real future,” he said. “The world of possibilities is open to them.” . . .

15,Billionaire Wealth Has Soared As Millions Fell Into Poverty During Pandemic: Oxfam,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost As the deadly COVID-19 pandemic has raged on, the world’s richest have only got richer, while tens of millions of people have plunged into poverty. In a report released Sunday, Oxfam detailed how the wealth of billionaires increased more than ever before over the past two years: The 10 richest people in the world — all white men — more than doubled their wealth, from a collective $700 billion to $1.5 trillion. From March 2020 to November 2021, a new billionaire was created every 26 hours, according to the report. Meanwhile, the organization estimated that over 160 million people have been pushed into poverty in that time. “One of the single most powerful tools we have to address this level of egregious and deadly inequality is to tax the rich,” Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, said in a news release. “Instead of lining the pockets of the ultra-wealthy, we should be investing billions of dollars into our economy, our children and our planet, paving the way for a more equal and sustainable future.” Oxfam’s report estimates that the 252 richest men now hold more wealth than the 1 billion women and girls living in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean combined. During the pandemic, women were especially economically hard-hit because many work in industries with disproportionate job losses; others were forced to leave work to care for children and elders. Women collectively lost $800 billion in earnings in 2020, and there are 13 million fewer women in the workforce now than in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit people of color disproportionately hard, the report noted: Through November 2021, in the U.S, Black and Latinx people were about twice as likely to die from the virus than white people. Similarly, during England’s second wave of the pandemic, Bangladeshi people were five times more likely to die of COVID-19 than white Brits. In Brazil, Black people were 1.5 times more likely to die than white people. In the U.S, Black and Latinx people also work disproportionately in industries like the service or domestic sectors, which faced significant job loss, as well as in health care or agriculture, where workers deemed “essential” continued to work on the front lines as others stayed safely home. Millions of Americans received increased unemployment aid and three stimulus checks from the federal government during the pandemic, but undocumented immigrants were barred from this support. “There is no shortage of money... There is only a shortage of courage and imagination needed to break free from the failed, deadly straitjacket of extreme neoliberalism,” Oxfam International’s executive director Gabriela Bucher said in a news release. “Governments would be wise to listen to the movements — the young climate strikers, Black Lives Matter activists, #NiUnaMenos feminists, Indian farmers and others — who are demanding justice and equality.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Mike Pence's Former Press Secretary Slams Moral 'Disrepair' Of Republican Party,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Mike Pence’s former press secretary Alyssa Farah Griffin blasted the moral “disrepair” of the Republican Party on Friday after she’s received hate messages for reportedly cooperating with the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. “Getting a lot of hate for thinking 1/6 was a big deal,” Griffin tweeted. “There’s nothing less conservative [than] trying to overturn democratic process,” she snapped. “I watched a violent mob call for my boss & mentor, Mike Pence, to be hanged on the steps of the US Capitol,” she added. Getting a lot of hate from the Right for thinking 1/6 was a big deal. 1) there’s nothing less conservative or trying to overturn democratic process 2) I watched a violent mob call for my boss & mentor, Mike Pence, to be hanged on the steps of the US Capitol. If we can’t acknowledge we are morally in disrepair as a Party, it will be the GOP’s undoing, not how bad Biden is doing or how ineffective democrats’ policies are. Axios reported on Thursday that Griffin is cooperating with congressional investigators. Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short is also among those in Pence’s circle talking to the House select committee. Short wrote a scathing draft article intended for The Washington Post in which he attacked the pressure put on the then-vice president on Jan. 6 to hold up certification of Electoral College votes, which would have violated both the Constitution and Pence’s oath of office. While Short was hunkered down with Pence amid the melee that day, he was receiving emails from Donald Trump ally and right-wing attorney John Eastman, who authored so-called coup memos on how the then-president could overturn his 2020 election loss. Eastman blamed Pence for the violence and told Short there was still time for Pence to hold up the pro forma electoral vote certification, according to Short’s intended op-ed piece. “The ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary,” Eastman reportedly messaged Short.

1,"53 Migrants Dead, 54 Injured In Truck Crash In South Mexico",social-justice," TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) — Rescue workers rushing to a highway accident found a horrific scene of death and injury after a freight truck jammed with as many as 200 migrants tipped over and crashed into the base of a steel pedestrian bridge in southern Mexico. The migrants inside the cargo trailer were tossed and crushed in a pile of both the living and the dead. By late Thursday, the death toll stood at 53, and authorities said at least 54 people had been injured. It was one of the worst single-day death tolls for migrants in Mexico since the 2010 massacre of 72 migrants by the Zetas drug cartel in the northern state of Tamaulipas. Volunteer rescuers hauled bodies off the pile by their arms and legs, while some migrants scrambled to extract themselves from the twisted steel sheets of the collapsed container. One young man, pinned in a heap of unmoving bodies, wriggled to free the lower half of his frame, his face wrenched into a grimace as he extracted himself from the weight of the dead. Nearby, a man blinked his eyes, unable to move as he lay on the shoulder of the road. Next to him was a fellow migrant, stouter and older, whose eyes stared lifeless and unblinking into the setting sun. While the Mexican government is trying to appease the United States by stopping caravans of walking migrants and allowing the reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, it hasn’t been able to stop the flood of migrants stuffed hundreds at a time into freight trucks operated by smugglers who charge thousands of dollars to take them to the U.S. border — trips that all too often lead them only to their deaths. The most severely injured, many bloodied, were carried by their arms and legs to plastic sheets set on the road. Those who could walk were led, stunned and uncomprehending, to the same sheets. Ambulances, cars and pickup trucks were pressed into service, ferrying the injured to hospitals. Later, the dead were laid in rows of white sheets, side by side, on the highway. Rescue workers who first arrived said that even more migrants had been aboard the truck when it crashed and had fled for fear of being detained by immigration agents. One paramedic said some of those who hurried into surrounding neighborhoods were bloodied or bruised, but still limped away in their desperation to escape. About 200 migrants may have been packed into the truck, said Guatemala’s top human rights official, Jordán Rodas. While shocking, that number is not unusual for migrant smuggling operations in Mexico, and the weight of the load — combined with speed and a nearby curve — may have been enough to throw the truck off balance, authorities said. Luis Manuel Moreno, head of the Chiapas state civil defense office, said about 21 of the injured had serious wounds and were taken to local hospitals. The federal Attorney General’s Office said three were critically injured in the crash on a highway leading from the Guatemalan border toward the Chiapas state capital. Sitting on the pavement beside the overturned trailer, survivor Celso Pacheco of Guatemala said the truck felt like it was speeding and then seemed to lose control. Pacheco said there were migrants mostly from Guatemala and Honduras aboard and estimated there were eight to 10 young children. He said he was trying to reach the United States, but now expected to be deported to Guatemala. Marco Antonio Sánchez, director of the Chiapas Firefighter Institute, said ambulances raced victims to three hospitals, carrying three to four injured each. When there weren’t enough ambulances, they loaded them into pickup trucks, he said. Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei wrote on Twitter: “I deeply regret the tragedy in Chiapas state, and I express my solidarity for the victims’ families, to whom we will offer all the necessary consular assistance, including repatriation.” At the Vatican, Pope Francis, who visited Chiapas in 2015 and has made the plight of migrants a hallmark of his papacy, sent a telegram of condolences Friday to the archbishop of Tuxtla Gutierrez. In the note, he offered prayers for the victims, their families and for the injured. The truck had originally been a closed freight module of the kind used to transport perishable goods. The container was smashed open by the force of the impact. It was unclear if the driver survived. Those who spoke to survivors said the migrants told of boarding the truck in Mexico, near the border with Guatemala, and of paying between $2,500 and $3,500 to be taken to Mexico’s central state of Puebla. Once there, they would presumably have contracted with another set of smugglers to take them to the U.S. border. In recent months, Mexican authorities have tried to block migrants from walking in large groups toward the U.S. border, but the clandestine and illicit flow of smuggling has continued. In October, in one of the largest busts in recent memory, authorities in the northern border state of Tamaulipas found 652 mainly Central American migrants jammed into a convoy of six cargo trucks heading toward the U.S. border. Irineo Mujica, an activist who is leading a march of about 400 migrants who have been walking for almost 1 1/2 months across southern Mexico, blamed Thursday’s disaster on Mexico cracking down on migrant caravans. Mujica and his group had almost reached the outskirts of Mexico City, after weeks of dealing with National Guard officers who tried to block the march. Mujica said the group would stop and offer prayers for the dead migrants. “These policies that kill us, that murder us, is what leads to this type of tragedy,” Mujica said. In fact, they are two very different groups. Caravans generally attract migrants who don’t have the thousands of dollars needed to pay migrant smugglers. Migrants involved in serious accidents are often allowed to stay in Mexico at least temporarily because they are considered witnesses to and victims of a crime, and Mexico’s National Immigration Institute said it would offer humanitarian visas to the survivors. The agency also said the Mexican government would help identify the dead and cover funeral costs or repatriation of their remains. Mass deaths of migrants are something that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been desperate to avoid, even as his administration has accepted requests from the U.S. government to stem the flow of migrants moving north. “It is very painful,” he wrote on his Twitter account about the crash."
2,Donations Pour In For Missouri Man Freed After 43 Years Of Wrongful Imprisonment,social-justice," KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — More than $1.5 million had been raised as of Saturday for a man who spent 43 years behind bars before a judge overturned his conviction in a triple killing. The Midwest Innocence Project set up the GoFundMe fundraiser as they fought for Kevin Strickland’s release, noting that he wouldn’t receive compensation from Missouri and would need help paying for basic living expenses. The state only allows wrongful imprisonment payments to people who were exonerated through DNA evidence, so the 62-year-old Strickland wouldn’t qualify. After nearly 43 years, Kevin Strickland, a client of @The_MIP, will finally be freed. https://t.co/DAyRXtBzAV Judge James Welsh, a retired Missouri Court of Appeals judge, ordered his release on Tuesday, finding that evidence used to convict Strickland had since been recanted or disproven. By Sunday evening, more than $1.56 million had been donated to help Strickland. Strickland has always maintained that he was home watching television and had nothing to do with the killings, which happened in 1978 when he was 18 years old. As he left prison, he said he was “thankful for God walking me through this for 43 years.”"

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what?

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Prosecutors Say Ahmaud Arbery Was Killed On White Defendants' False ‘Assumptions’,social-justice," Social Justice Reporter Over a year and a half after the killing of Ahmaud Arbery outraged the country and presaged the civil rights demonstrations that followed the murder of George Floyd, three white men, Gregory and Travis McMichael and William Bryan, went on trial in Georgia. Prosecutors described to the jury how the men chased, “trapped” and then killed the 25-year-old Black man during his Sunday jog near a construction site. “Greg McMichael said it perfectly. Mr. Arbery was ‘trapped like a rat,’ that is what he told police,” said State Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski in Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick, Georgia. The jury is composed of 11 white people and one Black person. Prosecutors asked Judge Timothy Wamsley this week to reinstate eight Black potential jurors and argued that defense lawyers had held them from the final jury due to their race. Arbery was out for a jog in a residential neighborhood in Brunswick on February 23, 2020, when he was shot to death by the McMichaels, who do not contest they shot him. But Gregory McMichael told police he believed Arbery resembled a suspect involved in a string of robberies in the area. Dunikoski showed a map outlining the location of Arbery’s home and where the construction site was located. Video footage showed Arbery walking around the construction site in the Satilla Shores neighborhood and then leaving as neighbors made a 911 call. Arbery and other people in the neighborhood had previously been filmed near the construction site, but Dunikoski said that neighbors had told the McMichaels 12 days before the men shot Arbery that there was no evidence anything had been taken from the site. Rather, she said, the father and son acted off of a presumption that a Black man was a threat, chased Arbery and gunned him down in broad daylight when they saw him near the site again. In 911 calls the prosecution played on Friday​​, Gregory McMichael is heard saying there is a “Black man running down the streets” moments before apparently shooting him. “They did everything they did based on assumptions. And they made decisions in their driveway that took a young man’s life,” Dunikoski told the jury at the beginning of her statement. Video footage also shows William Bryan jumping inside of a pickup truck and chasing Arbery down during the incident. Bryan, who is also charged in the case, captured the video of Arbery’s killing. Authorities say he participated in the fatal encounter. The footage then shows the men confronting Arbery. As the video played, Dunikoski described how the 25-year-old was shot in his torso and also his wrist while the men surrounded him. Arbery was unarmed when he was killed, Dunikoski said. Prosecutors then mentioned that Gregory McMichael had said that he told Arbery, “Stop! I’ll blow your fucking head off!” in his statement to police. “At this point, Mr. Arbery is under attack. By all three of these gentlemen,” Dunikoski stated. “Mr. Arbery could not even call for help, even if he wanted to, because he did not have a cell phone on him.” Following video footage of the killing, Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, broke down in tears in the courtroom. Remarks from the defense followed, with attorney Robert Rubin arguing, “It’s tragic that Ahmaud Arbery lost his life, but at that point, Travis McMichael was acting in self-defense.” According to the prosecution, Travis McMichael killed Arbery at close range after the three men had chased him for five minutes. Rubin told the jury that his client had fired his gun three times at Arbery. Frank Hogue, Greg McMichael’s attorney, agreed with many of Rubin’s arguments and depicted the Satilla Shores neighborhood as a community suffering from the fear of property crime. He told jurors the neighborhood had witnessed several break-ins. It was a “quiet street in a quiet neighborhood,” Hogue told the jury, and Greg McMichael had suspicions about the “young man” who ran past him “hauling ass,” as he had described it to police. “He was absolutely sure, he was absolutely certain and he was absolutely right,” Hogue said of Greg McMichael recognizing Arbery from prior video footage in which the 25-year-old hadn’t taken anything from the construction site. “The guy he saw was the guy he suspected,” Hogue said. Glynn County police officer William Duggan, a 12-year veteran of the department and the second to arrive at the scene of Arbery’s death, was the prosecution’s first witness on Friday. Duggan’s body camera footage capturing Arbery’s death and the McMichaels reacting to it was played for jurors after the judge asked anyone who would have an “emotional” reaction to leave the courtroom. The footage showed blood in the middle of the street. Duggan said he saw Travis McMichael “covered in blood” and asked him if he was OK. It was quick reply, he recalled. “No, I’m not OK, I just fucking killed somebody,” Duggan told prosecutors of McMichael’s response. Duggan said he did not know the father and son at the time of the incident. The defense had asked the court to limit the state’s presentation of the body camera footage during the trial. On Oct. 1, the state filed a motion asking that the request be denied. The state also filed several other motions last month to make some information inadmissible, including that Arbery was on probation at the time of his killing. Additionally, the state moved for a GBI toxicologist’s report that found THC in Arbery’s system to be inadmissible. After mass protests against racism and police brutality following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the trial of Arbery’s killers now sits as a landmark case on race relations in America. It took over two months for the McMichaels and Bryan to be arrested. The three Georgia men are all charged with a federal hate crime and attempted kidnapping in Arbery’s death. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation also charged them with felony murder. They were arrested over 70 days after the video of Arbery’s killing went viral on social media.

11,Families Of Charleston Shooting Victims Reach $88 Million Settlement With Justice Department,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost The Justice Department reached an $88 million settlement with the survivors and families of the victims of the 2015 massacre at Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. DOJ announced Thursday that the family members of those killed in the mass shooting would get $6-7.5 million each and the survivors $5 million each. The settlement is one of the largest civil rights settlements in history. In 2015, self-proclaimed white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people praying during Bible study inside the historically Black church. He later told FBI agents he wanted to start a race war. Bakari Sellers, a former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and friend of attack victim Clementa Pinckney, noted to reporters ― after meeting with Attorney General Merrick Garland at the Justice Department ― that the number 88 has played a major role in white supremacist circles. “88 is a weird number, because it’s enveloped in so much hate. Dylann Roof had 88 on his shoes,” Sellers said of the hate symbol, which is meant to signify “Heil Hitler,” as H is the eighth letter of the alphabet. “88 is steeped in so much white supremacy and hate. And so today we get to give ... a big F-U to the white supremacists and racists in this country by saying that we’re taking this tragedy that they tried to tear our country apart with and building Black communities and generational wealth.” The families and survivors sued the FBI in 2016 over the agency’s failed background check during a firearm sale, which should have stopped Roof from being able to buy the gun he used. Sellers credited Garland and Vanita Gupta, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, for their work to bring a fair settlement to the case. “They can’t bring my father back ... But they’re doing whatever they can to acknowledge the fact that this hurts. This is pain that I’m going to have to live with for the rest of my life,” Eliana Pinckney, the daughter of slain pastor Pinckney, said at a press conference Thursday. “As a young African-American woman, to see the government acknowledge the fact that racism still exists ... and do everything they can to correct a mistake that happened is so important,” she added. Roof has been sentenced to death for the massacre, the first such sentence in the U.S. for a federal hate crime. Last word goes to Eliana Pinckney, the daughter of Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the domestic terror attack. pic.twitter.com/CJbQxEKQrQ Reporter, HuffPost Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,'A Lot Of Trauma': Haitian Families Deported From Border Struggle To Recover,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Marinise Sinais Cedieu keeps replaying in her head what happened to her in Del Rio, Texas: being handcuffed in front of her 3-year-old son, the screams of another man whose handcuffs were too tight, going a week without a hot meal. Cedieu, a Haitian mother of two, came to the border hoping to pursue a better life for her family in the United States after first moving to Chile in 2016. Instead, she found herself camped out in frightful conditions for five days, hoping to be granted entry. On Sept. 21, U.S. Border Patrol agents forcibly removed Cedieu, her husband, and her son and swiftly deported them back to Haiti, a country she had not seen in five years where political instability, violence and the coronavirus pandemic have upended life. Cedieu is one of the 7,000 Haitian migrants and asylum-seekers the Biden administration has recently deported back to Haiti under Title 42, a Trump-era order that allows immigration officials to quickly deport people crossing the border under the pretense of pandemic health concerns, typically without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. Continued use of the policy has outraged lawmakers and immigration advocates, who have called on President Joe Biden to halt deportations and repeal Title 42, a policy they call cruel and inhumane. While many Haitians were initially hopeful that the Biden administration would follow through on immigration reforms and grant opportunities to those most vulnerable, many immigrants find themselves in even direr situations than before. “It’s just disappointing how arbitrary this U.S. practice has been about who to deport, who not to deport,” said Nicole Phillips, the legal director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration nonprofit advocacy group. “[The administration] is assuming that there’s a choice, that Haitian migrants are choosing to come to the U.S.–Mexico border. But in my experience in speaking with Haitian migrants, their primary concern is to be in a politically stable and secure environment, after the trauma of living in Haiti.” In Haiti, Cedieu was struggling financially and couldn’t find sustainable work to provide for her two children. Since then, the situation in the Caribbean nation has only gotten worse. In July, Haiti’s president was assassinated following months of political unrest and instability that have only intensified. In August, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck the southwestern part of the country, killing more than 2,000, injuring 12,000, and leaving more than 650,000 people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. At least 59% of Haiti’s population lives under the poverty line, while 24% live in extreme poverty ― and the wealth disparities are only expected to rise due to country’s the high levels of inequality and slow economic growth. Considered one of the most unequal countries in the region, Haiti’s lack of public services, including access to health care, clean water and education, is a direct consequence of the country’s fragile public institutions and governance, which are rooted in a legacy of colonialism and authoritarianism. Haiti is also one of the few countries in the world that has yet to administer a vaccine against COVID-19, and the pandemic has taken a major toll. “The Americas region needs to come together and not just push off Haitians onto somebody else,” said Phillip. “They need to come together and figure out solutions so that Haitians are welcomed as asylum seekers, as refugees who are unable to return to their country.” “The failures that we’ve seen from the Biden-Harris administration to provide care and compassion to Haitians is one of those examples of how policy has been intentionally blind to Black people.” Many Haitian migrants have sought refuge in South America searching for work and lax border restrictions. Chile hosts one of the world’s largest Haitian diasporas, according to the Los Angeles Times, since many Haitians migrated to the Andean nation in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. In 2012, fewer than 2,000 Haitians resided in Chile; by 2020, the number had grown to 182,000. Cedieu and her husband were able to get by in Chile and even had their second child there. But they described tough conditions, and they had to leave Cedieu’s eldest son behind in Haiti with family because they could not get him a passport. Phillips has interviewed dozens of Haitian migrants stuck in Mexico over the past weeks, and many told her they’d faced racism and xenophobia in South America that drove them north. Her clients said they were not being paid proper wages and had received little to no support when they sought help from law enforcement. One Haitian father told Phillips his daughter was being targeted for sexual assault. Another woman said she had been turned away from a hospital when she was in labor. While in Chile, Cedieu and her husband heard about several family members who had successfully migrated to the United States. With former President Donald Trump, who had scapegoated immigrants and referred to Haiti and other nations as “shithole” countries, a record number of Haitian migrants and asylum-seekers presumed the Biden administration would welcome them with open arms. In August 2021, Cedieu and her family began a long trek north by foot. They traveled for a month from Chile through Colombia and Central America and up to Mexico, then finally into Del Rio. The journey is often riddled with hurdles and risks. To make it to the U.S., migrants and asylum-seekers heading north from South America are required to cross the jungle of the Darien Gap ― the infamous 60-mile trek between Colombia and Panama where travelers have experienced robberies, rapes, wild animals and drug traffickers. Haitian and other Black migrants and asylum-seekers are particularly susceptible to certain perils, including “high rates of extortion and abuse by law enforcement and immigration, extortion and kidnapping by organized crime, and racism by the general populace through the countries in which they are moving through,” said Nicole Ramos, the director of Al Otro Lado’s Border Rights Project. When they do make it to the U.S.-Mexico border, the U.S. immigration system only compounds their challenges. The situation in Del Rio was anything but welcoming for Cedieu and thousands of other Haitians. In September, viral imagery circulated of Border Patrol agents on horseback chasing and whipping their horses’ reins at Haitian migrants, many of whom were camped along the river in Del Rio waiting to be processed by immigration authorities. Cedieu and her family spent five days under the international bridge connecting Del Rio to Ciudad Acuña in Mexico with thousands of other Haitians, waiting to meet with immigration officials. Food and clean water were scarce, she told HuffPost via an interpreter. She knew Haitians inside the U.S. qualified for Temporary Protected Status, by which the U.S. government acknowledges the dangerous conditions in Haiti, and she was hopeful her family would get the chance to finally find stability and safety. Instead, Cedieu watched as Border Patrol agents rounded up Haitian families around her. She and other mothers tried to ask for help, including diapers for their babies, but were rejected. Her son developed diarrhea that led to an infection Cedieu says he is still suffering today. “It’s not fair to treat people like I was treated,” said Cedieu. “I’m not a criminal.” Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that it had launched an investigation into the matter, it didn’t stop the Biden administration from continuing deportation flights, sending hundreds of Haitians back each day. Between Sept. 19 and Oct. 3, the U.S. expelled more than  7,000 Haitians, including hundreds of families with children, according to the Department of Homeland Security. “To see people with their families and still keep sending them back to Haiti, there’s no consciousness,” said Cedieu. “The border is one linear death camp.” Advocates say that even Haitians who are granted entry face discriminatory treatment in the U.S. immigration system. The United States granted less than 5% of Haitians’ asylum requests between October 2018 and June 2021, the lowest rate among 83 nationalities for which asylum decision data is available, according to an Associated Press analysis. “There is anti-Blackness in these policies. Immigration policy in the United States is not made with a lens that benefits Black folks in general, and then other times, we’ve seen laws specifically crafted to exclude Black people and to exclude Haitians,” said Patrice Lawrence, the executive director of the UndocuBlack Network. “The failures that we’ve seen from the Biden-Harris administration to provide care and compassion to Haitians is one of those examples of how policy has been intentionally blind to Black people.” Those failures show up in a multitude of ways, Lawrence said, including the fact that Haitians and other Black migrants and refugees are not believed during asylum interviews that are often rushed or not even conducted in their own language. In continuing policies like Title 42, the Biden administration is failing vulnerable people who need help, immigration advocates say. “If you have governments creating circumstances that are going to lead to a slow death, like lack of access to proper housing, clothing, hygiene, clean water food, medical services, you’re creating conditions that are genocidal when you’re doing so knowingly. That’s where we are. The border is one linear death camp,” said Ramos. Cedieu is struggling back in the countryside of Haiti. She has yet to find work. She sold her house years ago and is currently staying with relatives in a less-than-ideal situation. But she doesn’t intend to stay for long. She plans to go back to Chile. The U.S. no longer seems like an option for her. “It was so much suffering. [The U.S. government] didn’t need to do that to us,” she said. “It’s a lot of trauma associated with it all.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,My Great-Grandparents Fled Nazi Germany. Here's Why I Applied For German Citizenship.,social-justice," Guest Writer On Aug. 28, 2019, I received an email from the German consulate informing me that my family’s renaturalization application had been approved: We were Germans. Again. After submitting a patchwork of documentation in January 2017 — gathered from Freiburg, London, Haifa and the San Fernando Valley — that proved that my grandfather, prize-winning Israeli physicist Shlomo Alexander, was the same Edgar Solomon Alexander born a German citizen in 1929 and forced to flee to British Palestine before he was old enough to read, we waited without word from the embassy for two and a half years. Half-convinced that our file was fated to rot on the desk of an undermotivated government employee forever, the email informing us that we’d been approved for German citizenship surprised us. My father called me that same day and paraphrased from an old Hebrew folk song, “The hour we have yearned for, the hour is here.” This was a joke, of course. Very few people get renaturalized to Germany out of a deep connection with a lost homeland. I, knowing that, grammatically, ‘nicht’ comes after ‘weiss,’ spoke the most German out of any of us, and my mother, a Unitarian from Missouri and the only member of the family ineligible for citizenship, had the most German blood. (Through her, I’m distantly related to the boxer/Aryan ubermensch propaganda symbol Max Schmeling, which I’ve always found faintly ridiculous.) German renaturalization is the process of obtaining citizenship as a restorative measure for “victims of persecution by the Nazi regime who were deprived of their German nationality on political, racial or religious grounds between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945.” The idea underlying this policy is that those of us whose parents and grandparents were stripped of their citizenship were, ourselves, always Germans in essence, and now the law is simply recognizing this unalterable truth. “I was happy to have my German passport, of course, but no passport or paperwork could make me German.” Most descendants of German Jews, however, are not so sentimental about the old country. They go through the process primarily for the purpose of obtaining citizenship in a European Union country. The German passport is the third most powerful in the world, allowing access to 191 countries without a visa — an appealing prospect for Jews in Israel (ranked 23) or in Latin American countries like Argentina and Brazil (tied at 19). For Americans, the appeal usually has more to do with the ability to live and work in Europe without sponsorship or to get access to universal health care in case of serious illness. In 2016, there was a spike in applications for German renaturalization coming from Britain and the United States due, of course, to the unexpected results of the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election. This bumped the application processing time from approximately nine months to, in our case, 32 months. “We’re moving to Germany to escape the Nazis,” I’d joke. After the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the crowd shouted anti-Semitic chants, tacitly endorsed by President Donald Trump, and the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the joke started to seem less ridiculous. In my family, I was the main advocate for renaturalization, having spent a semester abroad in Berlin, where I made some close friends. I thought I might want to go to grad school there one day if writing for a living didn’t work out. Since it was the same amount of work either way, my father and brother chose to apply alongside me. My dad, who grew up in Israel and acquired U.S. citizenship as an adult, asked his sister if she and her sons were interested in applying jointly with us. They had only Israeli citizenship, so becoming members of an EU state seemed even more appealing. We met with a restitution specialist from the German Consulate in Los Angeles, scanned birth certificates and marriage licenses, and dug up mid-century letters that my great-grandfather, the physicist Ernst Alexander, had received from his former University of Freiburg mentor, the Nobel laureate and fellow Third Reich exile Georg von Hevesy. Most of these were written in an English so stilted and formal that it seemed almost mystical ― “Times are very favourable for getting money for research,” writes Hevesy in the early ’60s. It is striking that two men who once spoke to each other daily in German would choose to correspond years later in English, even at the expense of fluid communication. My father found evidence of a lawsuit Ernst mounted in 1956 against the West German government arguing that, had he not been deprived of his position in 1933 on the basis of his Jewish heritage, he would have become a tenured professor at the University of Freiburg, and thus deserved appropriate compensation. Defending him, a Freiburg friend’s character testimonial explains that my great-grandfather was an excellent scientist and “belongs amongst those Jews who feel particularly close to German culture and tradition.” (He lost that lawsuit, but won another years later.) I discovered a handwritten letter to Ernst from his father Georg Alexander, dated Jan. 22, 1938. It had been tucked into a worn leather pouch in a crate of diaspora miscellanea in my parents’ Los Angeles garage. Georg and his wife had just visited Ernst and his family in Jerusalem and then returned home to Berlin. Georg writes about his happiness at seeing “the beloved faces of Shlomo and Dinah,” elaborating that, “the children are really beautiful, well, and healthy, and I have only the wish that they may grow up to be your joy. Just as I always feel joy when I see the four of you around me in my thoughts, even though it can’t overcome my worries.” Of the newest round of anti-Semitic laws, banning Jews from leaving the country among other restrictions, Georg writes only that, “It’s really getting more and more uncomfortable.” Perhaps due to fear of censors reading his correspondence, he doesn’t say more, but there is a sense of foreboding throughout the letter. It reads as if he knows he is going to die. I couldn’t see how the embassy could classify this as proof of citizenship, but my father, who had done most of the work, sent over a scan anyway. There were some bureaucratic delays. The restitution specialist couldn’t find my grandfather’s birth record in Freiburg, and my aunt had to order new copies of her sons’ birth certificates from the excruciatingly inefficient Israeli Ministry of the Interior. Some documents that would have strengthened our case had disappeared, most likely in the Old Jerusalem house of Dinah, my grieving great-aunt who had recently lost her husband to a heart attack and her left leg to diabetes. Already in the middle stages of dementia, nobody could ask her to dig through the past, even if we’d been callous enough to try. Still, our contact at the consulate felt that we had enough evidence. After all, my father’s cousin in London had received her German citizenship in the ’90s based on the same documents. After I learned that we’d been approved for citizenship, I made an appointment at the German Embassy in New York, where I was living, to sign paperwork and apply for a passport. I got my passport photo taken in a surreal combination flower shop/photo studio, and I thought I looked stereotypically German enough ― pale and unsmiling ― in the resulting pictures. I went through the metal detectors in the UN building, waited in line behind a few men dressed in the suits and top hats of the ultra-orthodox Jews, who I assume were there for the same purpose as I was, and then signed papers in front of a very enthusiastic German man. “You know,” I said, “I spent a semester in Berlin when I was in college.” The man smiled and said something to me in German. “Ich weiss nicht,” I replied. “Are you happy to be German?” he asked. “Oh! Yeah. Of course.” Then I received a little metal pin with crossed American and German flags and a bag of Haribo gummy bears, which they warned me weren’t kosher, and I was sent on my way. I was happy to have my German passport, of course, but no passport or paperwork could make me German. My great-grandfather Ernst and his wife Ernestina (yes, really) were Germans, even when their national identity conflicted with the identity of the nation they called home. They were German even after the German government fired my great-grandfather from his position at the university, stripped the pair of their citizenship, forced them to flee with very few possessions, and sent those of their family members who remained in Germany to die in Auschwitz. They were German even after they’d learned Hebrew and spent over half their lives in Israel. They spoke German at home and decorated their Jerusalem apartment with Bauhaus furniture bought from Ernst’s cousin, a German judge-turned-Tel Aviv carpenter. They couldn’t shed their Germanness any more than I could adopt it. It’s ironic that I applied for German citizenship in part as a safeguard against the rise of ethnonationalism and conservative extremism, the very things that drove my great-grandparents out of Germany. While I won’t draw direct parallels between Nazi Germany and modern America, racist and anti-Semitic hate crimes increased dramatically during the Trump era. Even now that he’s out of office, the white supremacists he encouraged to emerge from the shadows have not yet slunk back into them. Countries around the world, such as the Philippines, Brazil, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, have fascist leaders, and we are still in the midst of a wave of modern fascism. My father, an immigrant, considers himself American in a way that his grandparents could never consider themselves Israeli. He says that the best thing about America is its flexibility: Anybody can become American, not just on paper, but in their souls. I think it’s a beautiful sentiment, and I hope it’s an enduring one, but I still find the extra security of having an EU passport ― just in case ― comforting.

14,The Segregationist-Inspired Law That Joe Biden Just Can’t Quit,social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost On Jan. 17, 2020, three masked men banged on the door of the house where a young woman we’ll call Alicia was hiding in San Vicente, El Salvador. The men threatened to break in if no one answered. Her cousin opened the door, and the three went straight for Alicia ― grabbing her hands, stripping off her clothes and raping her. The last thing she heard before losing consciousness was that they’d kill her if she told the police. But her cousin had already fled and called the police. The masked men saw cops approaching, scattered in different directions and evaded arrest. Alicia filed a report the next day, and told police that the armed men had repeatedly approached her while out shopping and wanted her to join Mara Salvatrucha, a violent street gang with an international presence. When she refused, they threatened to rape and kill her, then kill her parents. When the officer called colleagues in Alicia’s hometown asking for a warrant, they said the men were suspected in several homicides. The officer noted in his report that Alicia had nowhere safe to stay. Alicia tried to escape the violence by fleeing to the United States. She made it as far as Virginia before a state police officer pulled over the car carrying her and several other migrants. They called Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Seeing that she’d entered the United States without authorization the year before, ICE referred her case to the U.S. attorney’s office. Living in the United States without legal authorization is a civil offense, handled by immigration courts that can issue deportation orders. But crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in prison. And anyone with a removal on their record can be prosecuted for the felony of illegal reentry and imprisoned for up to two years, if they have an otherwise clean criminal record, and up to 20 for those convicted of serious crimes. Congress first passed those laws in 1929, at the urging of a notorious segregationist senator from South Carolina, but invoked them only sporadically until around 2005, when immigration authorities wanted to beef up penalties for jumping the border to deter migrants. Prosecutions have become an increasingly controversial part of the immigration enforcement system, and have accounted for around half of the federal criminal caseload since 2009. These prosecutions were a key feature of former President Donald Trump’s hardline approach to immigration. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” policy requiring all U.S. attorneys in the five districts that touch the U.S.-Mexico border to systematically prosecute every unauthorized migrant Border Patrol apprehended. The family separation debacle that year resulted from the Trump administration extending zero tolerance to parents traveling with their kids, shunting mothers and fathers into criminal courts while their kids remained in civil custody. With less publicity, Sessions also directed U.S. attorneys in all 94 federal districts to consider illegal reentry prosecutions for any migrants with a prior removal on their record, regardless of their criminal records, ties to the community or fears of returning to their home countries. That’s what happened to Alicia. Before Trump took office, her lack of a criminal record, the fact that she got caught well outside the border zone, and the extraordinary violence in her case would have all made her a low priority for deportation, let alone federal prosecution. Instead, she now faces the prospect of a felony conviction and prison time, both of which threaten to torpedo whatever chances she might have for leniency when she goes before an immigration judge. Public defenders and immigrant rights groups spent the Trump years, especially after family separation, crafting challenges to the illegal entry laws, citing its flatly racist origins and the fact that it targets Latin Americans almost exclusively. Until recently, the best they could do for their clients was to win their release on bail and drag out their cases as long as possible, hoping that the next administration’s prosecutors might drop them. A large-scale purge of immigration prosecutions cases would be unusual, but also logical for a Democrat. Congressional deadlock on immigration since the early 2000s has meant that presidential administrations have used the power of the executive to ramp up enforcement or dial it back. That’s what Republican George W. Bush did when systematizing immigration prosecutions, and what Democrat Barack Obama did with his policy of “prosecutorial discretion,” which directed ICE to drop deportation proceedings against migrants with family ties and clean criminal records. Several of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, led by Julián Castro, championed repealing the laws criminalizing illegal entry in response to Trump’s family separations. Though Biden wasn’t among them, some defenders imagined his administration might begin to drop at least some of the most egregious immigration prosecutions, as Obama’s had done in immigration court. Their wish partially came true. Shortly after Biden took office, defenders outside the southern border region stopped seeing Trump-era numbers of otherwise petty immigration offenders getting charged with felony reentry. But months after Trump’s exit from the White House, cases like Alicia’s still linger in federal court, as the Biden administration inherits the remnants of zero tolerance with no apparent interest in reversing it. Neither the U.S. attorney’s office in the Western District of Virginia nor the Justice Department responded to requests to comment on the value of prosecuting cases like Alicia’s. “I was hopeful they would take a fresh look at a lot of these cases that have been sitting around and be merciful,” said Randy Cargill, the public defender representing Alicia in criminal court. “But they haven’t.” Before Trump, the federal district of western Virginia, where Alicia was charged, typically saw a handful of illegal reentry cases each year, Justice Department statistics show. They usually involved people with lengthy criminal records or who were facing other charges, federal public defenders there say. But illegal reentry prosecutions in the district spiked more than 300% over Trump’s term, with more than 60 cases in 2019 and again in 2020. “Our office saw a dramatic rise in illegal reentry prosecutions,” federal public defender Erin Trodden wrote in an email. “Many of the cases filed previously are still on the docket.” That pattern appeared to repeat in many of the 89 federal districts far from the U.S.-Mexico border. From 2013 to 2016, which roughly coincides with Obama’s second term, illegal reentry cases outside U.S.-Mexico border districts dropped by an average of 5% per year, according to a HuffPost analysis of Justice Department statistics. But under Trump, the trend reversed, with felony reentry cases jumping by an average of 20% annually outside the southern border. Of the 24 non-border districts where reentry cases at least doubled between Obama’s second term and Trump’s presidency, 15 were located in the South. The Southern District of Georgia saw the steepest rise, jumping from nine cases to 197 ― an increase of more than 2,000%. Those numbers may not capture the full picture. Prosecutors often charge felony illegal reentry cases as a misdemeanor illegal entry, though that charge technically applies only when law enforcement catches someone in the act of jumping the border. Most migrants will take the misdemeanor charge if offered, allowing prosecutors to clear the cases quickly. Illegal entry misdemeanors are typically handled in magistrate court and not tallied in federal district court caseloads. Some of those cases stemmed from the Trump administration’s practice of prosecuting workers for reentry after ICE arrested them in worksite raids ― including at least two single mothers arrested at Mississippi poultry plants in 2019. Others reflect the Trump administration’s hyperfocus on stacking immigration penalties on every possible person. Some of those prosecuted landed on ICE’s radar as so-called “collateral arrests,” agency-speak for finding someone without legal immigration status in the course of arresting someone else, often a family member. And in other cases, like Alicia’s, prosecutors are targeting exactly the sort of people that Democrats cited as examples of the logic behind prosecutorial discretion during Obama’s presidency and the need to do away with zero tolerance under Trump’s. In 2016, three suspected Nueva Generación gang members abducted Jorge de la Mora Cobian in Mexico, and kept him blindfolded in an unknown location while they demanded a ransom from his family. When his family didn’t pay, they cut off one of de la Mora Cobian’s fingers. They eventually let him go but a few weeks later came back, once again asking for money. Two months after the kidnapping, de la Mora Cobian walked into the United States with his wife and three kids at the San Ysidro border crossing in San Diego to ask for asylum. Immigration authorities separated him from his wife and kids. After a month in detention without knowledge of his family, an asylum officer found de la Mora Cobian lacked “credible fear,” the first step toward claiming asylum. Without a lawyer and relying on suggestions from other detainees, he agreed to return to Mexico instead of appealing. His wife and kids, on the other hand, passed their credible fear interviews and entered the United States legally. A few days after his deportation, immigration authorities caught him trying to cross into the country around Calexico, in California, and removed him again. Eventually, he made it into the United States, and settled with his family in Washington, where he avoided further problems with the law. When ICE agents arrested him in 2019 at a traffic stop, prosecutors charged him with felony reentry. A federal judge released him on bond. His criminal case is still pending. “I’ve had countless guys with minimal criminal histories, people that weren’t dangers to the community ― strictly, in my opinion, petty prosecutions. They would just prosecute everybody,” said Paul Shelton, de la Mora Cobian’s public defender in Washington state. “They may not be charging new cases, but they are not dismissing the ones that are pending.” At the same time, the Biden administration now finds itself defending the law criminalizing illegal entry in federal court. In a landmark ruling in August, U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Nevada found the laws criminalizing illegal entry and reentry unconstitutional, writing that they were passed with racist intent in 1929. South Carolina segregationist Coleman Blease championed the law, and eugenicists widely supported it, with one testifying to a congressional committee that “immigration control is the greatest instrument which the Federal Government can use in promoting race conservation of the Nation,” Du’s order says. Prosecutors in the Nevada case accepted that Congress passed the 1929 version of the law with racist intent and acknowledged that it targeted Mexicans and other Hispanics. But they pointed out that the modern law comes from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and targets Latin Americans because of geography rather than discrimination. Congress, however, copied the illegal entry laws into the Immigration and Nationality Act almost word for word, during a session in which legislators repeatedly referred to migrants with the derogatory term “wetback,” passing a law with that name the same year, the order notes. Du said the INA suffered from the same bias. Lawyers with the Justice Department appealed the ruling the next day. The quick reaction surprised Kara Hartzler, a federal public defender in San Diego who has also challenged the constitutionality of the illegal entry law on racial animus grounds. “It’s a racist law and has disparate impact,” Hartzler said. “It’s just as much a racial issue as it is an immigration issue. We’ve raised it in dozens of cases.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit isn’t likely to consider whether Judge Du was right until next year, Hartzler said. In the meantime, people like Alicia, who is out on bail, wait as their cases drag on, evolving from a vestige of the Trump administration to an unexpected feature of Biden’s. By tradition, when the party controlling the White House changes hands, U.S. attorneys typically resign to make way for new appointees. This month, the Senate began confirming the first of them into their new positions, including Christopher Kavanaugh for western Virginia. “She is the poster child for mercy,” Cargill said. “Maybe they’ll take another look at this.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,2020 Had The Most Reported Hate Crimes Since 2001: FBI Data,social-justice," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The most hate crimes in the U.S. since 2001 were reported last year, according to newly released data from the FBI that also revealed a stunning 76% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. Though anti-Asian incidents made up just a small percentage of the 8,263 hate crimes reported in 2020, they did rise significantly, from 158 in 2019 to 279 in 2020, according to the FBI’s Hate Crime Statistics report. Overall, the majority of hate crime incidents reported last year — roughly 50% of them — were against Black people. Meanwhile, 55% of known perpetrators of racial bias hate crimes were white, while 21% were Black or African American. “Every hate crime is an attack on the community,” Jay Greenberg, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s criminal division, told ABC News. The FBI’s 2020 data came from 15,138 law enforcement agencies around the country. Roughly half of all hate crime incidents reported were classified as intimidation, 27% were simple assault and nearly 18% were aggravated assault (which the FBI defines as “physical attacks intended to inflict severe or aggravated bodily injury”). After racial bias hate crimes, which made up the majority of the cases, 20% involved sexual orientation bias, 13.3% involved religious bias, 2.7% involved gender identity bias, 1.4% involved disability bias, and 0.7% involved gender bias. The report released Monday amends an August report that failed to include all of Ohio’s data due to a technical error, the FBI said. In 2001 ― the year of the Sept. 11 attacks — people reported 9,730 bias-motivated incidents, the most in the last two decades. The fewest hate crimes (5,462) were reported in 2014 and increased every year thereafter, with the exception of 2018, when there was a slight decrease. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian American and Pacific Islander advocacy organizations and scholars, has previously warned that anti-Asian hate crimes have risen exponentially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The group has received reports of nearly 10,000 incidents since March 2020. The majority of incidents — or 43% — targeted people of Chinese descent. When victims were attacked verbally, it usually involved someone blaming them for the coronavirus, Stop AAPI Hate reported. Researchers have long said that hate crimes are likely underreported, with a survey finding this past spring that 35% of Asian Americans would be “uncomfortable” telling the police they were targeted in a hate-related incident. Greenberg encouraged anyone who believes they were a victim of a hate crime to contact law enforcement. Incidents can be reported to the FBI by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI or by submitting a tip on the FBI’s website. “We would like the public to reach out to us if they believe that they are a victim of a hate crime,” Greenberg told ABC News. “It’s not for the public to make that determination; we will work with our state and local partners and help determine how best to investigate that.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Border Patrol Agents Got Off Easy After Violent Posts About Migrants: House Report,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The House Committee on Oversight and Reform found that Customs and Border Patrol agents faced lax discipline after posting violent, offensive messages about migrants and members of Congress in a Facebook group, per a new report. The report, released Monday, showed that most CBP agents who were found by the agency to have committed misconduct in their posts on a secret Facebook page had their discipline reduced from the recommendation made by CBP’s Discipline Review Board and continued to work with migrants. In 2019, a ProPublica report detailed offensive posts by CBP agents in the Facebook group “I’m 10-15” — with 10-15 being code for “aliens in custody.” One post had an illustration of progressive Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), who is young and Latina, engaging in oral sex with a detained migrant. The House’s subsequent investigation into the Facebook group and the agency’s discipline of the offending officers found that “a Border Patrol agent who posted a sexually explicit doctored image and derogatory comments about a member of Congress” had his discipline reduced from a recommended removal from the agency to simply a 60-day suspension, and was awarded back pay, per the report. Another Border Patrol supervisor who posted an internal CBP video of a migrant falling off a cliff to their death was also not fired, as recommended, but only given a 30-day suspension. And an agent with a “history of multiple infractions” — including posting a photo of a drowned migrant father and child, calling them “floaters” — was not removed, but rather allowed to retire with disability benefits. Of the 60 agents who were found by the agency to have committed misconduct, according to the House report, most received reduced discipline, and 57 continue to work with migrants today. Only two agents were removed from the agency. “I am deeply troubled by CBP’s broken disciplinary process that allowed for significant reductions in discipline and allowed agents to resume work with migrants and children after engaging in serious misconduct,” Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, said in a press release. “CBP’s failure to prevent these violent and offensive statements by its own agents or impose adequate discipline creates a serious risk that this behavior will continue,” the lawmaker added, calling on CBP to take “immediate steps to reform its disciplinary processes.” .@OversightDems investigation into @CBP agents engaged in misconduct in a SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP:Discipline for most agents was SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED from the recs made by CBP’s own Discipline Review Board & agents continue to work with migrants.Our very troubling findings 1/9 pic.twitter.com/6CRcMXSRBw While the CBP posts in question occurred during the Trump administration, Maloney noted that “systemic behavior problems within CBP persist” under the Biden administration. She pointed to the public outrage that erupted last month, after video showed CBP agents on horseback whipping ropes at Haitian migrants who were aiming to cross into the U.S. along the border between Texas and Mexico.

2,Pope Calls On Powerful Institutions To Change Status Quo To Better Serve The Poor,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Pope Francis on Saturday delivered a speech that demanded powerful institutions change their ways of operating in order to better serve the poor, stressing that the status quo keeps people in poverty, creating an unjust society. “Personal change is necessary, but it is also indispensable to adjust our socioeconomic models so that they have a human face, because many models have lost it,” the pope said at the World Meeting of Popular Movements, his own initiative for grassroots organizations and church leadership to work together for structural changes in favor of social, economic and racial justice. He called on several corporate institutions to make foundational changes aligned with helping disadvantaged people ― pharmaceutical labs to release vaccine patents; financial groups to cancel poor countries’ debts; extractive industries to cease destroying the environment; arms manufacturers to stop production; telecommunications giants to make educational material and connectivity more accessible, and more. He also demanded that the media push harder against disinformation, tech giants “stop preying on human weakness,” and food corporations “stop imposing monopolistic systems of production and distribution that inflate prices and end up withholding bread from the hungry.” The big food corporations to stop imposing monopolistic production and distribution structures that inflate prices and end up withholding bread from the hungry. “In the name of God, I call on powerful countries to stop aggression, blockades and unilateral sanctions against any country anywhere on earth. No to neo-colonialism,” he said. “Conflicts must be resolved in multilateral fora such as the United Nations. We have already seen how unilateral interventions, invasions and occupations end up, even if they are justified by noble motives and fine words. “This system, with its relentless logic of profit, is escaping all human control,” he continued. “It is time to slow the locomotive down, an out-of-control locomotive hurtling towards the abyss. There is still time.” The 84-year-old pope from Argentina has previously spoken out on many of the issues he mentioned Saturday, especially urging powerful people to create an economically and environmentally just world where the poor and marginalized aren’t left behind by the wealthy elite. On Saturday, he reiterated his support of protesters ― specifically young people ― who use their transformative power to fight injustice. “Do you know what comes to mind now when, together with popular movements, I think of the good Samaritan? ... The protests over the death of George Floyd,” he said. “It is clear that this type of reaction against social, racial or macho injustice can be manipulated or exploited by political machinations or whatever, but the main thing is that, in that protest against this death, there was the collective Samaritan who is no fool! This movement did not pass by on the other side of the road when it saw the injury to human dignity caused by an abuse of power.” Pope Francis is considered one of the most progressive pontiffs ever, having cautioned Catholics to focus on serving the poor and oppressed rather than becoming “obsessed” with topics like abortion, same-sex marriage and contraception. He is also one of the most vocal popes in terms of his commentary on social justice, climate change and systemic oppression. “Together with the poor of the earth, I wish to ask governments in general, politicians of all parties, to represent their people and to work for the common good,” he said. ”Let them stop listening exclusively to the economic elites, who so often spout superficial ideologies that ignore humanity’s real dilemmas. May they be servants of the people who demand land, work, housing and good living.” Reporter, HuffPost"
3,U.S. Plans To Comply With Order To Reinstate Trump-Era 'Remain In Mexico' Policy,social-justice," SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration said it plans to reinstate a Trump-era border policy next month to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court, complying with a judge’s order. It hinges on approval of the Mexican government, which has raised concerns that U.S. officials are working to address, the Justice Department said in a court filing late Thursday. Mexico wants cases to generally conclude within six months and ensure that asylum-seekers have timely and accurate information about hearing dates and times and better access to legal counsel. Mexico also wants exemptions for “particularly vulnerable populations” and better coordination on locations and times of day that asylum-seekers are returned to Mexico. About 70,000 asylum-seekers have been subject to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which President Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and Biden suspended on his first day in office. A federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri by ordering the Biden administration in August to reinstate the policy “in good faith.” The court filing says it should be in effect around mid-November. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas, a Trump appointee, left open the possibility that the administration could try again to end the policy, and officials say they will release a plan soon that they hope will survive legal scrutiny. U.S. Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas  ended the policy in June after an internal review, saying it achieved “mixed effectiveness.” Illegal border crossings fell sharply after Mexico, facing Trump’s threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy’s rapid expansion. Asylum-seekers were victims of major violence  while waiting in Mexico and faced a slew of legal obstacles, such as access to attorneys and case information. The administration will rebuild tent courts in Texas border cities of Laredo and Brownsville at a monthly cost of $24.6 million to operate, according to the court filing, and is working to ensure there is capacity in a system that is backlogged with 1.4 million cases. Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Thursday that it has concerns about asylum-seekers getting fair treatment in court under the policy, having access to legal counsel and being safe. Mexico said it also has raised questions about another U.S. policy to expel migrants without a chance to seek asylum. Trump invoked those powers, known as Title 42 authority, in March 2020 on grounds of preventing spread of the coronavirus. The Biden administration has strongly defended the special powers. “Mexico will continue discussion with the U.S. executive branch, with the aim of achieving a regional migration policy that is safe, orderly and regulated,” the Foreign Relations Department said. U.S. officials say the renewed “Remain in Mexico” policy will be applied to people who don’t qualify for Title 42 authority. The policy was last used largely on people from Spanish-speaking countries but officials say eligible nationalities have not been determined. Broad outlines of the reinstated policy come as the Biden administration has yet to develop the “humane” asylum system that the president promised during his campaign after quickly dismantling many Trump policies. Illegal border crossings have soared under Biden’s watch, with record numbers of unaccompanied children and, in September, the arrival of about 15,000 mostly Haitian migrants at a camp in Del Rio, Texas.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Judge Orders Trump To Give Deposition In Immigration Activists' Suit,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A New York judge has ordered former President Donald Trump to give a videotaped deposition next week in a lawsuit by a group of protesters who allege that Trump and his security team assaulted them during a 2015 rally against his hateful rhetoric about Mexican immigrants. The order by Bronx state Supreme Court judge Doris Gonzalez, which ABC News first reported Thursday, says that Trump must appear for a deposition on Oct. 18 at 10 a.m. Eastern, “or, in the event of illness or emergency, on another mutually agreed to date on or before” Oct. 31. The former president is expected to record the deposition on Monday in New York City’s Trump Tower, according to court papers. The lawsuit by several protesters of Mexican descent names Trump, the Trump Organization, his former head of security Keith Schiller and four unnamed members of Trump’s then-security team. Schiller became director of Oval Office operations under Trump in 2017, and later that year, the Republican National Committee hired him as an adviser on security for the 2020 convention. The lawsuit stems from a Sept. 3, 2015, protest outside Trump Tower over the then-presidential candidate’s inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Trump repeatedly blamed undocumented immigrants for the United States’ problems and called people crossing the border from Mexico criminals and rapists. The xenophobic rhetoric during his campaign only intensified when he became president. Schiller and the four security guards attacked peaceful protesters, according to the lawsuit. Guards allegedly told protesters that the sidewalk was private property (it is not) and pushed them away while taking their protest signs. Video evidence shows Schiller aggressively taking away protest signs from plaintiff Efrain Galicia and striking him in the head when Galicia tried to retrieve his sign. Trump tried to evade a subpoena ordering him to testify in the case in 2018, arguing that there must be “exceptional circumstances” to depose a high-ranking government official. Gonzalez denied the motion in 2019, saying that Trump’s argument did not apply because he was being called to answer for conduct that happened before he was in office. A judicial order eventually allowed the then-president to avoid having to testify in person while serving in the White House, according to CNBC. In July, with Trump out of office, Gonzalez ordered him to sit for the deposition that would be scheduled at a later date. The parties first agreed that he would be deposed in September, but moved the date to Monday due to Trump’s availability. “After defendants spent years unsuccessfully fighting to keep Donald Trump from testifying under oath, we will be taking his testimony in this case on Monday,” the plaintiffs’ lawyer Benjamin Dictor said on Thursday. “We look forward to presenting this case, including Mr. Trump’s video testimony, to the jury at his trial.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"Trump Goes Full Racist On Fox, Says Many Haitian Migrants 'Probably Have AIDS'",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump embraced familiar fearmongering rhetoric about migrants on Fox News on Thursday, warning against accepting Haitian asylum-seekers because “many of those people will probably have AIDS.” The former president made the comments during a discussion about immigration with host Sean Hannity, who said he was all for “legal immigration,” but asked if it was wrong to require a “security check to make sure you don’t have radical associations,” a COVID-19 test and proof that you “won’t be a financial burden on the American people.” Trump said he supported those measures and brought up “one other thing that nobody talks about.” “So, we have hundreds of thousands of people flowing in from Haiti. Haiti has a tremendous AIDS problem. AIDS is a step beyond. AIDS is a real bad problem,” he ranted. “Many of those people will probably have AIDS and they’re coming into our country. And we don’t do anything about it. We let everybody come in.” “It’s like a death wish for our country,” he added. Trump infamously called Haiti and African nations “shithole countries” during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers in 2018, and followed up by suggesting the U.S. welcome more immigrants from countries like Norway. Haitians have long sought asylum at U.S. borders. These migrants have for decades been subjected to violence and racial discrimination demonizing them as disease carriers. Conditions in the country have deteriorated after it suffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, a deadly tropical storm and the assassination of its president over the summer. An estimated 15,000 Haitian migrants ― not hundreds of thousands ― recently reached the international bridge in Del Rio, Texas, hoping to cross into the U.S. Since Sept. 19, the U.S. government has expelled more than 7,000 of them on flights back to Haiti. The Biden administration has been under fire for its treatment of Haitian migrants after footage showed border patrol agents on horseback corralling asylum seekers and shouting at them to return to Mexico.

Activists with the Bay Area Coalition for Economic Justice and Citizenship for All halted traffic for 45 minutes by stopping over two dozen cars on the bridge, organizers said in a release. Protesters held banners that read “citizenship for all, no exceptions” and “override the parliamentarian,” and chanted “Aquí estamos y no nos vamos” — “We are here and we’re not leaving.” Officers with California Highway Patrol arrested five of the activists, according to organizers. Immigrant families and allies occupy the Golden Gate Bridge demanding Senate Democrats override the Senate parliamentarian and finally pass #CitizenshipForAll. https://t.co/SbyJW1OYlB Earlier this month, the Senate parliamentarian ruled against including a path to citizenship for certain immigrants in Democrats’ major spending bill, which is being advanced through the budget reconciliation process. Activists on Thursday were calling for Democrats to overrule the parliamentarian — as some progressive lawmakers have also suggested. But this is unlikely to happen, given Democrats’ narrow majority in the Senate. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has said it is not “realistic” to do so, since “the votes needed on the floor are not there.” “Immigrant communities cannot wait another 20 years of failed promises,” organizers said in a release, noting that undocumented immigrants have been repeatedly excluded from stimulus aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they disproportionately work on the front lines in agriculture, health care and more.

13,Greyhound Settles Lawsuit Over Immigration Sweeps On Buses,social-justice," SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Greyhound Lines Inc. will pay $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit over the bus line’s practice of allowing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to board its buses in Washington state to conduct warrantless immigration sweeps, the state attorney general said Monday. The bus company failed to warn customers of the sweeps, misrepresented its role in allowing the sweeps to occur and subjected its passengers to discrimination based on skin color or national origin, Attorney General Bob Ferguson said. The money will provide restitution to passengers who were detained, arrested or deported after immigration agents boarded buses at the Spokane Intermodal Center. The amount each person receives will depend on the number of claims and the severity of harm suffered because of Greyhound’s conduct, Ferguson said. “Greyhound has an obligation to its customers — an obligation it cannot set aside so immigration agents can go on fishing expeditions aboard its buses,” Ferguson said in a press release. Dallas-based Greyhound issued a brief statement, saying it was pleased with the settlement. “By agreeing to the consent decree, we will more extensively communicate to our customers the policies and procedures we already have in place to serve the citizens of Washington state,” the bus company said. The settlement was filed in Spokane County Superior Court on Monday, the day a trial was set to begin. “My office first insisted that Greyhound make these corporate reforms in 2019,” Ferguson said. “If Greyhound had simply accepted our reasonable demand, they would have avoided a lawsuit.” Under the settlement, Greyhound also is required to: — Create a corporate policy that denies immigration agents permission to board its buses in Washington state without warrants or reasonable suspicion. — Issue a public statement, in English and Spanish, clarifying that Greyhound does not consent to immigration agents boarding its buses without a warrant or reasonable suspicion. — Place stickers on or near the front door of its buses stating that it does not consent to immigration agents boarding its buses without a warrant or reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit was filed last year, alleging that Greyhound allowed the sweeps aboard its buses since at least 2013. The company publicly acknowledged the practice in 2018. During the sweeps, Hispanic people and other passengers of color were subjected to invasive questioning by armed federal agents and were often required to get off the bus, Ferguson said. Immigration agents sometimes detained or arrested passengers, he said. For years, Greyhound contended it was legally required to allow Border Patrol agents to board its buses. But a memo last year from then-U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost confirmed Ferguson’s contention that agents can only perform warrantless immigration sweeps aboard buses with the consent of the company’s owner or employees. In late April, a Libyan-born comedian received a $35,000 settlement from the federal government after he filed a lawsuit contending Border Patrol agents in Spokane in 2019 wrongfully detained and interrogated him about his immigration status. Mohanad Elshieky was traveling from a gig in Pullman, Washington, to Portland, Oregon, when he was briefly detained in Spokane. He had been granted asylum and was legally living in the United States. According to the Northwest Immigration Rights Project, which represented Elshieky, federal agents boarded the bus and walked around before they asked Elshieky and a few others to step off the bus. They interrogated Elshieky for about 20 minutes, calling his papers fake and him illegal but eventually let him go. Andres Sosa Segura, who sued separately over a similar experience at the Spokane Intermodal Center in 2017, also will be awarded $35,000, the advocacy group said. “The hours I spent detained for no reason were terrifying, and all I wanted was to be with my family,” Sosa Segura said in an April news release from the group announcing the settlements. “I hope that this case sends a message that CBP agents need to respect the rights of people like me.”"
14,Black Immigration Orgs Demand Biden Halt Deportations Of Haitian Asylum Seekers,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Several Black immigration organizations have filed a formal complaint with the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, demanding that the Biden administration halt its continued deportations of Haitian asylum seekers. The complaint filed by four groups ― the Haitian Bridge Alliance, UndocuBlack Network, African Communities Together and Black Alliance for Just Immigration ― requests that any potential witnesses of Border Patrol abuses be allowed to remain in the U.S. while their asylum claims are investigated. The complaint was first reported by theGrio, and signed by dozens of advocacy groups. More than 13,000 Haitians were camped along the river at the Texas border town of Del Rio last weekend when Border Patrol officers on horseback charged at some of those gathered there, verbally assaulting and appearing to whip them. Photos of the violence shocked the public. Haitian asylum seekers — who have long been subjected to anti-Black discrimination and violence — have been trying to enter the U.S. via the Mexican border for years. The assassination of the Haitian president in July and a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in August have only made the situation more dire. In their complaint, the groups argued that by conducting immediate deportations, DHS has failed to comply with a recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement directive that instruct ICE to “withhold civil immigration enforcement action against victims or witnesses participating in criminal investigations.” “When victims have access to humanitarian protection, regardless of their immigration status, and can feel safe in coming forward,” the directive says, “it strengthens the ability of ... law enforcement agencies, including ICE, to detect, investigate, and prosecute crimes.” The complaint argues that such principles must also apply to victims of DHS offenses. “What we have witnessed in Del Rio is a repugnant display of our values, as deportations and expulsions have been administered based on a system of cruelty, sadism and oppression towards extremely vulnerable people,” Haitian Bridge Alliance executive director Guerline Jozef said in a press release. “President Biden and Vice President Harris campaigned on the promise of ending Trumpian policies that lack respect and humanity, especially when it comes to immigration and thus far, they have failed,” she continued. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has maintained that, while the images from Del Rio are disturbing and have prompted him to temporarily cease the use of horse patrol, he believes his department is doing the right thing by conducting mass deportations of Haitians. The Biden administration has granted temporary protected status for Haitians already in the U.S., but that does not extend to the new arrivals. On Sunday, Mayorkas defended the decision on “Meet The Press.” “That is the exercise of a public health imperative,” he said. “We’re in the midst of a pandemic and the Centers for Disease Control has a Title 42 authority that we exercise to protect the migrants themselves, to protect the local communities, our personnel and the American public. The pandemic is not behind us. Title 42 is a public health policy, not an immigration policy.” WATCH: @SecMayorkas says Haitian migrants were ""subject to Title 42 expulsion"" on #MTP @ChuckTodd: Is Title 42 ""an authority you still want to have?""Mayorkas: ""That is an authority that the Centers for Disease Control has determined to still be necessary."" pic.twitter.com/H9uxH8bPSz Title 42 of the Public Health Service Act gives federal health officials the power to take extraordinary measures to limit transmission of an infectious disease. Under former President Donald Trump, immigration officials began using that justification to deport asylum seekers arriving at the border, immediately returning them to their countries of origin and denying them the opportunity to apply for asylum. The Biden administration has continued the controversial policy. So far, about 4,000 Haitians camped out in Del Rio have been deported under Title 42, Mayorkas said. Critics of the policy have called it a thinly veiled measure to curb immigration. Federal health officials said last year that immigration officials in the Trump administration overruled senior CDC scientists who objected to invoking the rule for immigration purposes, saying there was no evidence that doing so would slow the spread of COVID-19. The complaint by the organizations notes that the migrants have been denied access to attorneys, interpreters, adequate medical care, fear-based screening and proper nourishment and sanitation, all under intense heat. It also highlights physical intimidation and violence against migrants by Border Patrol officers, and misleading statements made by Homeland Security officers to Haitians about where they were being flown to. “We’re not living up to our obligation as a nation to be a place of refuge for people seeking a better life,” former Obama administration Cabinet member Julián Castro told HuffPost earlier this week. “And in the least, asylum seekers, whether they’re from Haiti, or from one of these Northern Triangle countries should be allowed to make their asylum claim, instead of being severely expelled from the country. This was not the change we were hoping for on immigration policy.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Biden Admin's Handling Of Haitian Migrants Is Angering Democrats,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost On Thursday, Daniel Foote, the U.S. special envoy to Haiti, resigned from his position in protest of the “inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees.” He blasted President Joe Biden’s policy as “deeply flawed.” It was a stunning moment in the rapidly escalating crisis at the border, and yet another sign that Biden is losing the support of people in his own party — and even members of his administration — over his hard-line approach to Haitian migrants. Allies on Capitol Hill and beyond said they had high hopes that Biden would deliver on his promise of prioritizing refugees and asylum seekers through more humane immigration policies. Now, they’re distressed that that is not happening with Haitian migrants, who are being denied the chance to make asylum claims and, in many cases, are being sent back to Haiti under Title 42, a Trump-era order that, ostensibly due to the pandemic, allows immigration officials to quickly deport people crossing the border, typically without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. Haitian asylum seekers and refugees — many who trekked thousands of miles across South America to cross at the U.S.-Mexico border only be deported back to Mexico — have been subjected to anti-Black discrimination and violence. At least 61% of Haitian asylum seekers blocked from U.S. asylum protections reported being the victim of a crime while in Mexico, including kidnapping, rape, and robbery, according to an April report. “We cannot continue these hateful and xenophobic Trump policies that disregard our refugee laws,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday in a speech on the Senate floor. “We must allow asylum-seekers to present their claims at our ports of entry and be afforded due process.” Schumer, who represents the largest concentration of Haitian immigrants in the country, urged Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to cease the expulsion of Haitian migrants and end its use of Title 42. Biden has yet to speak publicly about the issue, even after a photographer captured U.S. border agents on horseback, chasing migrants and appearing to whip them. Julián Castro, a member of former President Barack Obama’s Cabinet, called the president out for his silence in an interview with HuffPost. “It is baffling and disappointing that President Biden himself has not clearly and forcefully spoken out against the mistreatment of Haitian asylum seekers. That seems like a no-brainer,” said Castro. “There are so many folks in Washington that are afraid to touch this issue,” he continued. “What they don’t get is that this issue is going to touch them, whether they want it to or not. So they might as well speak to it in clear value-based terms.” In Texas over the weekend, more than 13,000 Haitians, many of them families, were camped along the river in Del Rio, waiting to be processed by immigration authorities. Photos of Border Patrol’s response — agents on horseback whipping ropes at the Haitians — went viral online, prompting outrage from lawmakers and advocates alike. On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had launched an investigation into the matter and called the footage “extremely troubling.” “What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were was horrible,” Vice President Kamala Harris said on Tuesday. “And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there. But human beings should never be treated that way.” But that has not stopped the Biden administration from ramping up deportation flights, which began on Sept. 19, sending hundreds of people a day back to Haiti, the small Caribbean nation that is suffering in the aftermath of a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in August and political instability that led to the assassination of its president in July. More than 2,000 people have been sent back to Haiti since Sunday, including more than 40 children, and more flights are expected to continue: up to seven flights a day with more than 100 people on each. DHS said the majority of Haitians were being removed under Title 42. As of Thursday, the Haitian population in the Del Rio camps had dwindled to approximately 4,000. The White House doubled down, defending its handling of the Haitian migrants and pushing back against criticism from Democrats and reporters over the deportations. “First of all, they’re not deportations. People are not coming into the country through legal methods,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday when asked about the expulsion flights. However, it is legal under international and U.S. law for those fleeing their home country to ask for asylum at a port of entry, no matter how they enter the country. “Our policy process has continued to be the same with Haiti as it is for anybody coming through an irregular migration across our border,” said Psaki, who sought to shut down comparisons between the Biden and Trump administrations’ use of Title 42. “We could not see it as any more different from the policy of the prior administration, which the president feels ― we all feel ― was inhumane, immoral, ineffective, [and] wasn’t operationally working,” she said. “And because of the dysfunction of it, we have led to a very broken system that we’re dealing with today.” The Biden administration has defended its use of Title 42 as a public safety measure to slow the spread of the coronavirus, despite the fact that DHS officials acknowledged back in March that deported Haitian immigrants “may face harm” upon returning to their home country. Last month, the U.S. designated Haitians eligible for Temporary Protected Status due to the fact that Haiti was “grappling with a deteriorating political crisis, violence, and a staggering increase in human rights abuses.” Still, the U.S. had expelled over 3,700 Haitians under Title 42 by the end of August, and that number is expected to rise. ““We’re not living up to our obligation as a nation to be a place of refuge for people seeking a better life.""” Castro is concerned that, by appearing too much like Trump on matters of immigration, Biden might be taking a political risk that could result in the “Democratic coalition falling apart for 2022, and especially for 2024.” There are other signs of discontent among Democrats. Patrick Gaspard, the president of the Center for American Progress, a top Democratic think tank, visited the camps in Texas this week and released a statement on Friday calling on the Biden administration to “do more to protect Haitians” by immediately halting deportations and to “commit to a firm timeline to end Title 42.” That same day, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine, who is Haitian American, and 17 other attorneys general sent a letter to Biden urging the White House to reevaluate its policy plans. “While we are confident that your administration will address the alarming practices recently used to apprehend Haitian migrants at the border, we remain deeply concerned by the administration’s continuation of a summary deportation policy,” they wrote. “Individuals seeking asylum or other humanitarian assistance in our country deserve our respect and compassion, and they should not be treated differently from other migrants based on their country of origin. Haitians deserve the same due process as all others attempting to immigrate or flee to the United States,” they said. Meanwhile, one DHS official told Buzzfeed News, “Honestly I don’t how much longer I can stay at DHS if this continues.” Democratic lawmakers including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), who serves as co-chair of the House Haiti Caucus, held a press conference outside the Capitol on Wednesday echoing calls to suspend deportation flights and demanding accountability for what she called “the cruel, the inhumane and the flat-out racist treatment of our Haitian brothers and sisters at the southern border.” As immigration advocates continue to fight the Biden administration over Title 42 in court, White House officials are scrambling trying to repair the damage and hold meetings with Democratic and Black congressional leaders. The lack of clarity, upholding Title 42, and the hesitation to accept refugees have many in government beginning to doubt the White House’s efforts to “build back better” when it comes to immigration. “We’re not living up to our obligation as a nation to be a place of refuge for people seeking a better life. And in the least, asylum seekers, whether they’re from Haiti, or from one of these Northern Triangle countries should be allowed to make their asylum claim, instead of being severely expelled from the country,” said Castro. “This is not the change we were hoping for on immigration policy.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,U.S. Set To Admit Lowest Number Of Refugees Ever,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Despite President Joe Biden’s pledge to overhaul immigration and welcome refugees to the U.S., 2021 is on pace for a record low in refugee admissions. According to the latest State Department numbers, the U.S. has accepted just 7,637 refugees this year as of Aug. 31 ― putting it on pace for a historic low, as the fiscal year ends Oct. 1. The refugee cap, a number set by the president outlining the intended number of refugees allowed to enter in a given year, was set as up to 62,500 after pushback by advocates, but the U.S. is unlikely to meet that number by Sept. 30. The number of admitted refugees could rise before the end of the fiscal year following the evacuation of vulnerable Afghans and the arrival of thousands of Haitians seeking refuge at the southern Texas border. But refugee advocates and lawmakers alike are becoming increasingly frustrated with the administration’s slow-moving response to helping refugees and asylum-seekers. On Monday, the State Department announced that Biden will increase the refugee cap to 125,000 in the next fiscal year, which begins next month. The administration vowed to focus on key vulnerable groups during the 2022 fiscal year, including refugees from Central America, Afghans who worked with the U.S., and Uighurs, members of the predominantly Muslim ethnic group who are facing genocide at the hands of the Chinese government. “With the world facing unprecedented global displacement and humanitarian needs, the United States is committed to leading efforts to provide protection and promote durable solutions to humanitarian crises, to include providing resettlement for the most vulnerable,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, the president is federally required to consult with Congress to set and formally sign the presidential determination on refugee admissions ― the annual ceiling of refugees who are authorized to enter the U.S. The U.S. led the world in refugee admissions in the decades after the 1980 Refugee Act, resettling more people fleeing their home countries than the rest of the world combined. But those numbers fell dramatically under former President Donald Trump, who slashed the refugee cap each year in office. In 2016, the U.S. admitted nearly 85,000 refugees, the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. While Trump, who made refugees a political scapegoat during his tenure, was in office, the refugee cap was steadily slashed every year during his presidency, obliterating the cap from 110,000 set by former President Barack Obama during his last year in office to just 18,000 during the 2020 fiscal year, which was also Trump’s last in office. The actual number of refugees admitted that year — 12,000 — was even lower than the 18,000 ceiling. In 2018, the U.S no longer led the world in refugee resettlement ― the first time since 1980. The Biden administration has since struggled to rebuild the program. Cuts by the Trump administration have forced refugee resettlement agencies to downsize, lay off staff and shutter offices across the country. The coronavirus pandemic also created problems. Refugees who were approved to travel couldn’t leave the country due to lockdown measures and border restrictions. Embassies and consular offices across the globe closed down and stopped conducting interviews and appointments. Vulnerable groups, many of who have fled war or die in economic conditions, were stranded in makeshift shelters and camps, with a lack of access to clean water or space for social distancing. A State Department spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency has since taken steps to “rebuild and enhance the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program in line with the Administration’s priorities” which will enable the agency “to support increased admissions numbers in future years.” “We are committed to resettling as many eligible refugees as possible. We recognize, however, that we remain constrained by the global pandemic and the operational challenges posed by COVID 19-related restrictions,” the spokesperson added. More recently, the situation in Afghanistan and Biden’s hesitancy to formally accept more refugees only piled onto the problem when he missed the deadline to sign the directive by March 2021, forcing hundreds of refugees to cancel their flights to the U.S. as they awaited approval. When Biden signed the directive weeks later in April 2021, the White House initially announced it would keep Trump’s 2020 refugee ceiling of 15,000 and would continue to ban refugees from several Muslim-majority countries including Somalia and Yemen. The move sparked outrage from fellow Democrats and refugee groups, and the president walked back the decision mere hours later, raising the cap to 62,500 for the fiscal year 2021. Still, the U.S. was poised to admit under 8,000 as of last month. Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. military efforts and were admitted into the country through the Special Immigrant Visa program (SIV) were tallied in the State Department’s recent numbers. However, Afghans not eligible for that program and admitted under humanitarian parole — a pathway under immigration that allows certain individuals to enter and stay in the U.S. without a visa for urgent humanitarian reasons — are not tracked by the State Department’s Refugee Admissions Program. On Tuesday, state and local officials from all 50 states including New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Dan Johnson (R-Utah), and Chicago mayor Lori E. Lightfoot signed a bipartisan letter hosted by Refugees International, urging the Biden administration to make good on that promise of 125,000 refugees in the new year. “​​While we applaud increasing this year’s refugee admissions goal to 65,200, we are disappointingly on pace to reach only a fraction of that number. As international travel resumes and health checks are implemented, we hope resettlement is accelerated in this time of great need, and that public health and protecting refugees are not treated as mutually exclusive,” read the letter. Refugee resettlement groups worry that the U.S. will not reach the new cap either, even as global refugee numbers reached an all-time high at over 26 million. The new 125,000 cap is “a good step in the right direction,” said Jenny Yang, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. But Yang noted that it was still not enough on its own and called for the Biden administration to invest resources and funding into rebuilding the resettlement program, hiring more Refugee Corps staff, and streamlining security screenings more efficiently. “It’s certainly possible to reach 125,000, especially in light of the demands ranging from Afghanistan to Haiti to Hong Kong,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services. “Whether we have the infrastructure abroad and here at home is entirely in the hands of the administration.” The administration must take concrete steps in order to hit those numbers, she explained, such as hiring more staff to conduct more interviews and reopening resettlement offices. It will also need to find creative solutions to address the need, such as allowing remote interviews during the pandemic and opening up the option for private sponsorships. The State Department spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency has worked closely with resettlement agencies and will incorporate their feedback into efforts to rebuild the refugee program, including using video teleconference technology for refugee interviews, providing more funding and expanding community sponsorship opportunities. “We will continue to review, assess and apply the full range of tools and initiatives available to strengthen the domestic and overseas infrastructure of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including expanded hiring for critical roles,” the spokesperson added. Vignarajah hopes the administration takes away key lessons from what went wrong this year and avoids similar pitfalls, such as waiting too long to evacuate Afghan refugees. “The evacuation experience should be a reminder of how dysfunctional refugee and Special Immigrant Visa processing has become,” said Vignarajah. “There needs to be a hard look at what is the necessary setting to protect Americans, and ensure the strength of the system without permitting excessive and unnecessary redundancies.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Senate Parliamentarian Rules Against Path To Citizenship In Democrats' Spending Bill,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Democrats’ push to give young undocumented Dreamers a path to citizenship violates Senate rules, according to the Senate’s parliamentarian, who dealt yet another blow on Sunday to long-stalled immigration reform efforts in Congress. “Changing the law to clear the way to [legal permanent resident] status is tremendous and enduring policy change that dwarfs its budgetary impact,” Elizabeth MacDonough wrote in her memo to lawmakers. Top Senate Democrats had argued that certain immigration provisions directly affect the federal budget, and therefore could be included in the budget reconciliation process ― the legislative maneuver that will allow the party to pass President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda with a simple majority. Specifically, Democrats wanted to provide a path to citizenship for four categories of people legally in the U.S.: farmworkers, essential workers, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiaries and temporary protected status recipients. Doing so would boost economic growth, create jobs and increase wages, Democrats argued. Democrats also cited precedent from 2005, when the Republican-controlled Senate passed a bipartisan reconciliation bill that increased the number of immigrant green cards. “We feel very strong about that position and we hope it is persuasive,” Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the second highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, told reporters on Capitol Hill. But Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, who has held the job since 2012, rejected that reasoning. Only policies that directly change federal spending or revenues can be included in the reconciliation bill, she said. The ruling is a setback for immigration reform advocates, who viewed budget reconciliation as one of the last avenues to push reforms through and give some of the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. a path to citizenship in this Congress. Similar immigration reform proposals have stalled in Congress in recent years due to fierce GOP opposition and the Senate filibuster. That’s unlikely to change soon. Democrats could vote to overrule MacDonough and include the immigration provisions in the reconciliation bill. Alternatively, they could replace her with another parliamentarian who agrees with them, as the Republican majority did in 2001 after a dispute over President George W. Bush’s budget and tax cut proposals. But neither of those scenarios is seen as likely, given the party’s tenuous 50-seat majority, where any senator who disagrees can withhold their vote. “Abiding by the ruling of the parliamentarian is central to the function of the Senate,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said at a Sept. 14 press conference, calling MacDonough the “final” word on the matter. Earlier this year, Democrats’ push to pass a $15 minimum wage in their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package was similarly thwarted by the Senate parliamentarian, prompting calls from some progressives for her ouster. However, White House chief of staff Ron Klain, Biden’s top aide, quickly shot down that idea. “We are going to honor the rules of the Senate and work within that system to get this bill passed,” Klain said in February on MSNBC.

2,US Ramps Up Plan To Expel Thousands Of Haitian Migrants Gathered In Texas,social-justice," DEL RIO, Texas (AP) — Haitian migrants seeking to escape poverty, hunger and a feeling of hopelessness in their home country said U.S. plans to speedily send them back will not deter them as thousands of people remained encamped on the Texas border Saturday after crossing from Mexico. People continued wading across the Rio Grande on Saturday afternoon, re-entering Mexico to purchase water, food and diapers in Ciudad Acuña before returning to the Texas encampment under and near a bridge in the border city of Del Rio. Junior Jean, a 32-year-old man from Haiti, watched as people cautiously carried cases of water or bags of food through the knee-high river water. Jean said he lived on the streets in Chile the past four years, resigned to searching for food in garbage cans. “We are all looking for a better life,” he said. The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it moved about 2,000 of the migrants from the camp to other locations Friday for processing and possible removal from the U.S. Its statement also said it would have 400 agents and officers in the area by Monday morning and would send more if necessary. The announcement marked a swift response to the sudden arrival of Haitians in Del Rio, a Texas city of about 35,000 people roughly 145 miles (230 kilometers) west of San Antonio. It sits on a relatively remote stretch of border that lacks capacity to hold and process such large numbers of people. A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Friday that operational capacity and Haiti’s willingness to accept flights will determine how many there will be. The official said progress was being made on negotiations with Haitian authorities. The official said Friday that the U.S would likely fly five to eight planes a day, starting Sunday, while another official expected no more than two a day and said all migrants would be tested for COVID-19. Both officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Told of the U.S. plans on Saturday, several migrants said they still intended to remain in the encampment and seek asylum. Some spoke of the most recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, saying they were afraid to return to a country that seems more instable than when they left. “In Haiti, there is no security,” said Fabricio Jean, a 38-year-old Haitian who arrived with his wife and two daughters. “The country is in a political crisis.” Jorge Luis Mora Castillo, a 48-year-old from Cuba, said he arrived in Acuna on Saturday and also planned to cross into the U.S. Castillo said his family paid smugglers $12,000 to take him, his wife and their son out of Paraguay, a South American nation where they had lived for four years. Told of the U.S. message discouraging migrants, Castillo said he wouldn’t change his mind. “Because to go back to Cuba is to die,” he said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed off vehicle and pedestrian traffic in both directions Friday at the only border crossing between Del Rio and Ciudad Acuña, Mexico, “to respond to urgent safety and security needs.” Travelers were being directed indefinitely to a crossing in Eagle Pass, roughly 55 miles (90 kilometers) away. Crowd estimates varied, but Val Verde County Sheriff Frank Joe Martinez said Friday that there were about 13,700 new arrivals in Del Rio. Migrants pitched tents and built makeshift shelters from giant reeds known as carrizo cane. Many bathed and washed clothing in the river. Haitians have been migrating to the U.S. in large numbers from South America for several years, many having left their Caribbean nation after a devastating earthquake in 2010. After jobs dried up from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, many made the dangerous trek by foot, bus and car to the U.S. border, including through the infamous Darien Gap, a Panamanian jungle. It is unclear how such a large number amassed so quickly, though many Haitians have been assembling in camps on the Mexican side of the border to wait while deciding whether to attempt entry into the U.S. The flight plan, while potentially massive in scale, hinges on how Haitians respond. They might have to decide whether to stay put at the risk of being sent back to an impoverished homeland wracked by poverty and political instability or return to Mexico. Unaccompanied children are exempt from fast-track expulsions. DHS said, “our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey.” “Individuals and families are subject to border restrictions, including expulsion,” the agency wrote. “Irregular migration poses a significant threat to the health and welfare of border communities and to the lives of migrants themselves, and should not be attempted.” Stephen Miller, the main architect of former President Donald Trump’s hardline policies and a frequent critic of the Biden administration, expressed doubt that Haiti’s government would agree to the number of flights for a large-scale operation. He recounted daily calls with U.S. State Department officials last year over Haiti’s resistance to flights, with Haiti relenting only under the threat of sanctions. About 500 Haitians were ordered off buses by Mexican immigration authorities in the state of Tamaulipas, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) south of the Texas border, the state government said in a news release Friday. They continued toward the border on foot. U.S. authorities are being severely tested after Biden quickly dismantled Trump administration policies that Biden considered cruel or inhumane, most notably one requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while waiting for U.S. immigration court hearings. A pandemic-related order to immediately expel migrants without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum that was introduced in March 2020 remains in effect, but unaccompanied children and many families have been exempt. During his first month in office, Biden chose to exempt children traveling alone on humanitarian grounds. Nicole Phillips, legal director for advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance, said Saturday that the U.S. government should process migrants and allow them to apply for asylum, not rush to expel them. “It really is a humanitarian crisis,” Phillips said. “There needs to be a lot of help there now.” Mexico has agreed to take in expelled families only from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, creating an opening for Haitians and other nationalities. Mexico’s immigration agency said in a statement Saturday that Mexico has opened a “permanent dialogue” with Haitian government representatives “to address the situation of irregular migratory flows during their entry and transit through Mexico, as well as their assisted return.” The agency didn’t specify if it was referring to the Haitians in Ciudad Acuña or to the thousands of others in Tapachula, at the Guatemalan border, and the agency didn’t immediately reply to a request for further details. In August, U.S. authorities stopped migrants nearly 209,000 times at the border, which was close to a 20-year high even though many of the stops involved repeat crossers because there are no legal consequences for being expelled under the pandemic authority. ___ Lozano reported from Ciudad Acuña, Mexico and Spagat reported from San Diego.

3,"Richest 1% Of Americans Underpay Taxes By $163 Billion, Says Treasury",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Wealthy households underpay their federal taxes by $600 billion annually, according to the Treasury Department’s new analysis of what’s known as the “tax gap.” Most workers have federal income taxes automatically withheld from their paychecks, meaning the federal government has precise information about their earnings, but higher earners with more non-wage income can more easily avoid reporting it. “Today’s tax code contains two sets of rules: one for regular wage and salary workers who report virtually all the income they earn; and another for wealthy taxpayers, who are often able to avoid a large share of the taxes they owe,” Natasha Sarin, the Treasury Department’s deputy assistant secretary for economic policy, said in a Wednesday blog post. The top 1% of households “choose not to pay” more than $160 billion per year, Sarin wrote. The Joe Biden administration released the analysis Wednesday as part of its push for tougher tax enforcement to offset the cost of a massive overhaul of the federal safety net that Democrats plan to push through Congress this fall. Biden has proposed $80 billion in additional funding for the Internal Revenue Service, which the Congressional Budget Office has said would yield $200 billion in additional revenue. “For the IRS to appropriately enforce the tax laws against high earners and large corporations, it needs funding to hire and train revenue agents who can decipher their thousands of pages of sophisticated tax filings,” Sarin wrote. “It also needs access to information about opaque income streams ― like proprietorship and partnership income ― that accrue disproportionately to high-earners.” Democrats have also proposed requiring financial institutions to file annual information returns detailing the amount of money coming into and out of bank accounts, which the administration says would raise another $400 billion. The extra information would help the IRS enforce the tax code but would also encourage more voluntary compliance, since people would know the government has a better notion of their income. Sarin noted that the income tax noncompliance rate for wage income is only 1%, compared to as much as 55% for self-reported income sources from partnerships or proprietorships. Banks and Republicans hate the information reporting proposal so much that lawmakers omitted any increased funding for IRS enforcement from a bipartisan infrastructure deal even though senators wanted to offset its cost as much as possible. “This time-draining burden disregards banking privacy in order to squeeze more resources out of responsible Americans and entrepreneurs,” Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said last month. The Senate narrowly defeated a symbolic Crapo amendment to strip the proposed account reporting regime from a budget outline last month, but it’s one of several tax issues where some more conservative Democrats may sympathize with the proposal’s intended targets ― meaning it could get watered down or abandoned. Republicans, for their part, prefer to lament fraud among recipients of low-income tax credits, even though tax credit beneficiaries already get audited more than most other taxpayers. Raising new revenue is key for Democrats to enact their ambitious agenda of monthly child benefits, universal paid leave and affordable child care. Party leaders have said they want to offset the entire cost of their $3.5 trillion budget proposal, meaning they’ve set up a zero-sum situation where losing a dollar of revenue means losing a dollar toward making life easier for families who’d benefit from their proposals. In its previous estimate of the tax gap, the Treasury Department estimated it missed out on $441 billion before enforcement efforts and late payments for tax years 2011 through 2013. Charles Rettig, the IRS commissioner, said earlier this year he thought the tax gap could be as much as $1 trillion annually.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Migrant Children Spend Weeks At U.S. Shelters As More Arrive,social-justice," Five months after the Biden administration declared an emergency and raced to set up shelters to house a record number of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border alone, kids continue to languish at the sites, while more keep coming, child welfare advocates say. More than 700 children spent three weeks or longer at the government’s unlicensed sites in mid-July, according to declarations filed with a federal court overseeing custody conditions for immigrant youth. Advocates say children should be released quickly to their relatives in the U.S. or sent to a licensed facility. In one of the filings, a 16-year-old Salvadoran boy said children were served raw meat. It took more than a month for the boy, who said he speaks with both his parents each week, to be released to his father in Georgia. “When I wake up every day, I feel really frustrated. Of the youth that I arrived with, I am the last one here,” the boy said in his declaration. “I would like to be home with my dad right now.” When the Biden administration erected the emergency sites in March to ease dangerous overcrowding at border stations, they were meant to be a temporary fix. But months later, some wonder whether that’s still the case. Border crossings by children without an adult in July neared the same levels they did in March despite the summer heat. “If you have a dinner party that you plan to have for three people, and 30,000 people show up, you’re going to have a problem,” U.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee, who oversees the decades-old settlement agreement that governs custody conditions for the children, said at a recent hearing. “The infrastructure is not set up for tens of thousands of people coming in at one time, and somehow the paradigm has to shift to figure out how to deal with these types of numbers.” U.S. border authorities reported more than 18,000 encounters with unaccompanied immigrant children in July, up 24% from a month earlier. The rise comes in the busiest month yet for the Biden administration on the border, with a total of nearly 200,000 encounters even though crossings are typically expected to slow during the summer. According to a government report in early August, the Department of Health and Human Services had nearly 15,000 children in its care but only 11,000 licensed shelter beds for the immigrant children. Using large-scale facilities can fill this gap, though advocates said the government would do better by expanding licensed shelters where children are given case workers, recreation and six hours of education on each weekday. The Department of Health and Human Services is tasked with caring for the children until they can be sent to live with relatives or other sponsors in the United States while they wait for an immigration judge to decide whether they can stay in the country legally. While the agency has a broad network of state-licensed shelters that could be expanded, ample space in foster care programs and large, so-called influx care facilities that adhere to specific standards for staffing and conditions, it continues to turn to these emergency sites. Advocates say the emergency intake sites adhere to none of the agency’s existing standards and are an inadequate and expensive option, especially for young, vulnerable children already coping with the trauma of leaving home and making the dangerous trip north. “There are other ways to do this. They kind of stick their head in the sand and act like the emergency intake sites are the only game in town, and it’s just so far from the truth,” said Leecia Welch, senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law and one of the attorneys representing children in the federal court case. “When you start at horrifying, and better is still awful, that’s just not OK.” Advocates have asked Gee to order the administration to follow standards at emergency sites like it does for its influx care facilities, which also aim to offset an increase in arrivals. For example, a Carrizo Springs, Texas, facility for up to 1,000 children must provide a care worker for every eight children while they’re awake and at least one individual counseling session each week for each child. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for Oct. 1. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions from The Associated Press. The Obama and Trump administrations also opened temporary facilities when there was a jump in children crossing the border alone, but the numbers were not near what the Biden administration has seen. Once the coronavirus appeared, the Trump administration largely shut down the Southwest border to asylum seekers under a pandemic-related measure, turning away many immigrants. Then, in November, a federal judge ordered  the administration to stop expelling unaccompanied children under the policy. Two months later, President Joe Biden took office and the number of immigrant children seeking to cross began to rise. Shelters for immigrant youth were still running at reduced capacity due to coronavirus concerns, and the Department of Health and Human Services was suddenly strapped for space to house them. In recent months, the average length of stay at the emergency intake sites has declined and the Department of Health and Human Services has shut down some sites and worked to improve conditions in others. But at one point, some children were so desperate to get out of the government’s largest emergency facility at Fort Bliss Army Base, in Texas, that they tried to escape, according to declarations filed with the court. After getting caught, some children were sent to a more restrictive youth shelter in New York. A 16-year-old from Honduras said that was an improvement since they received pizza and other good food instead of the raw, bloody chicken served at the Army base. They also had teachers, while there was no class before. “If anything, it paid off to misbehave,” the teen, who would spend the day in bed at Fort Bliss feeling like a hostage, said in a declaration. “I am so grateful that I tried to escape from that hellhole. It was horrible, and I could never sleep.” Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said U.S. policies are making the problem worse. He believes parents are sending their children to the border knowing they have a better chance of getting in alone than with a relative. Biden has maintained public health rules implemented by the Trump administration that have barred people from seeking asylum at the border, but he exempted children who cross alone. If the U.S. let families apply to enter the country legally, authorities could manage the flows, eliminating the need for these emergency shelters, he said. “We are still in an emergency — the numbers are still high — but this absolutely is not the way to deal with it,” Nowrasteh said. “We have the capacity to process enormous numbers of asylum claims if we want to. It is only whether the government wants to.”"

12,Joe Biden Says U.S. On Track To Complete Afghanistan Evacuations By Aug. 31,social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost President Joe Biden said Tuesday that U.S. and its allies are on track to complete evacuations from Afghanistan by his Aug. 31 deadline, with thousands of U.S. citizens, Afghans and others being flown out of the country each day. “I’m determined to ensure that we complete our mission, this mission,” Biden said in public remarks from the White House. “I’m also mindful of the increasing risks.” The president said the U.S. had helped evacuate 70,700 people since Aug. 14, including about 12,000 in the last 12 hours alone. Biden met with G-7 leaders earlier Tuesday and discussed U.S. troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan. He is under increasing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, along with refugee advocates, to push off the deadline in order to ensure vulnerable people are able to get out of the Taliban-controlled country. But Biden suggested he won’t budge, warning that staying longer could be dangerous. Every day the U.S. remains in the country increases the risk of attacks on American forces by terrorist groups and the Taliban, which has said it will not accept an extension. Biden cautioned that completing evacuations by Aug. 31 is contingent on the Taliban allowing access to the Kabul airport, where flights are taking off regularly to transport vulnerable people to safety. Biden said he had asked the Pentagon and State Department to develop contingency plans in case the deadline had to be extended. Lawmakers from both parties — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) earlier Tuesday — along with refugee advocates argued that meeting that deadline is less important than getting Americans and Afghan civilians out of the Taliban-controlled nation. Evacuations are ramping up. The U.S. and its allies flew about 21,600 people out of the country from Monday to early Tuesday, the largest number in a 24-hour period yet. Evacuation flights are leaving the Kabul airport every 45 minutes, according to the Pentagon. But there are many more people to evacuate, including those who worked with U.S. troops and now are seeking protection under the Special Immigrant Visa, or SIV, program. As of last week, more than 17,000 Afghan nationals and about 53,000 of their family members were waiting to be approved under the SIV program. The U.S. welcomed only about 2,300 people under the program from January to July, and another 2,000 last week. Refugee advocates have been critical of Biden’s approach to evacuating Afghan allies and civilians, and particularly of the administration’s failure to grant more special immigrant visas sooner. Some called on Biden to continue work in Afghanistan until the evacuation is done, rather than sticking to the Aug. 31 deadline. “President Biden must continue the evacuation until all U.S. citizens, Afghan allies, and other extremely vulnerable Afghans have reached safety,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the refugee resettlement group Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement on Tuesday. “We swore a sacred oath to protect them – we cannot break it in the eleventh hour.” The White House has noted that former President Donald Trump decimated the refugee resettlement pipeline, making it difficult to ramp up quickly. Still, many advocates have questioned why Biden didn’t act more quickly to resettle Afghan allies. “They seem to be afraid. They seem to be operating out of fear that being a bit bolder on issues with refugees, asylees and migrants will somehow cost them politically,” Julián Castro, a former housing secretary who pushed to expand refugee resettlement during his presidential bid, told HuffPost last week. “This is an area where there’s growing disappointment and impatience ― and the stirrings of real anger ― towards the administration.” Biden said the U.S. will be a leader in efforts to take in refugees and encourage allies to do the same. Anyone resettled in the U.S. will be fully vetted, he said. “We must all work together to resettle thousands of Afghans who ultimately qualify for refugee status,” Biden said. “The United States will do our part, and we are already working closely with refugee organizations to rebuild a system that was purposefully destroyed by my predecessor.” Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,U.S. Judge In Nevada: Felony Deportation Law Unconstitutional,social-justice," LAS VEGAS (AP) — In a court ruling with potentially broad implications for U.S. immigration cases, a federal judge in Nevada found that a criminal law that dates to 1929 and makes it a felony for a person who has been deported to return to the United States is unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno, in an order issued Wednesday, found the law widely known as Section 1326 is based on “racist, nativist roots” and discriminates against Mexican and Latinx people in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment. “Anybody who works in federal courts knows the statute,” Franny Forsman, retired longtime chief of the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Nevada, said Thursday. “There really are a large number of cases that have been brought over the years under that section. They’re mostly public defender cases.” Section 1326 of the Immigration and Nationality Act makes it a crime for a person to enter the U.S. if they have been denied admission, deported or removed. It was enacted in 1952 using language from the Undesirable Aliens Act passed by Congress in 1929. Penalties were stiffened five times between 1988 and 1996 to increase its deterrent value. Forsman said she expected the government will appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. But Julian Castro, secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration, tweeted that he doubted the Justice Department would want to defend a law with “an incredibly racist history.” Acting U.S. Attorney Christopher Chiou and an aide did not immediately respond to messages about the ruling. Forsman called Du’s order groundbreaking for its thoroughness. Du, a Vietnamese immigrant, was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama and sworn in in 2012. “I think it will have implications because it’s going to be difficult to get around her reasoning,” Forsman said of the court order. “It’s a little hard to get around a statute that was called the ‘Wetback Act’ by the people enacting it.” The derogatory term often refers to Mexican migrants who have entered the country illegally, but it’s also used to disparage all Hispanics. Du said she considered written and oral arguments and expert testimony about the legislative history of the law from professors Benjamin Gonzalez O’Brien of San Diego State University and Kelly Lytle Hernández of the University of California, Los Angeles. “Importantly, the government does not dispute that Section 1326 bears more heavily on Mexican and Latinx individuals,” the judge said in her 43-page order dismissing the June 2020 criminal indictment of Gustavo Carrillo-Lopez. Carrillo-Lopez was arrested in Nevada in 2019 after having been deported in 1999 and again in 2012, according to prosecutors. His federal public defender, Lauren Gorman in Reno, did not immediately respond Thursday to an email. The judge said she saw no publicly available data about the national origin of people prosecuted under Section 1326, but cited U.S. Border Patrol statistics showing that more than 97% of people apprehended at the border in 2000 were of Mexican decent, 86% in 2005, and 87% in 2010. “The government argues that the stated impact is ‘a product of geography, not discrimination,’ and that the statistics are rather a feature of Mexico’s proximity to the United States, the history of Mexican employment patterns and the socio-political and economic factors that drive migration,” Du wrote. “The court is not persuaded.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,U.S. Moves To Cut Backlog Of Asylum Cases At US-Mexico Border,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday proposed changing how asylum claims are handled, aiming to reduce a huge backlog of cases from the U.S.-Mexico border that has left people waiting years to find out whether they will be allowed to stay in America. Under the proposal, routine asylum cases no longer would automatically be referred to the overwhelmed immigration court system managed by the Justice Department but would be overseen by asylum officers from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Advocates for the change see it as a way to help those with legitimate claims for protection while allowing officials to more quickly deal with people who do not qualify for asylum or are taking advantage of the long delay to stay in the United States. “Individuals who are eligible will receive relief more swiftly, while those who are not eligible will be expeditiously removed,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. The proposal must go through a public comment period before it can be adopted as a new policy. Immigration courts have an all-time high backlog of about 1.3 million cases. The Trump administration tried to deal with the issue in part by imposing stricter criteria for asylum and forcing people to seek protection in Mexico and Central America. President Joe Biden’s proposal would streamline the process. The reason for the change is that more people have been seeking asylum under U.S. law, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years. As the system works now, people who present themselves at the border or are apprehended by the Border Patrol and identify themselves as asylum-seekers must pass what is known as a “credible fear” interview. A USCIS asylum officer determines whether they meet the criteria of someone facing persecution in their homeland because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Even if they pass, their case is now referred to an immigration judge and they can wait years for a resolution. The theory behind the proposed change is that experienced USCIS asylum officers can more quickly sort cases. People who are denied can ask ask an immigration judge to review the decision and seek an appeal if they are turned down again. Advocates for the new policy believe some with weaker claims may be dissuaded by the early denial. DHS plans to hire 1,000 asylum officers and 1,000 support staff to handle the extra workload that will result from the change. USCIS already has has more than 400,000 asylum cases pending adjudication. Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, had previously called for adoption of this change, saying in a recent Migration Policy Institute opinion piece that it is “potentially a game changer” that would balance humanitarian protection for those eligible with the need to control the border. “The recent increase in arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, which are the latest in a series of periodic spikes, make this change all the more compelling,” wrote Meissner, now a senior fellow at the institute. Immigrant advocacy groups welcomed aspects of the proposal, but there were still critics. Human Rights First, for example, said asylum-seekers should be able to get a full rehearing of their case, not just a review, from an immigration judge if their petition is denied and should not be subject to the fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal if they are determined to be ineligible to stay. “The proposed rule could be used and abused to rush asylum-seekers through adjudications without sufficient time to secure legal representation, gather evidence or prepare their cases, leading U.S. agencies to return to persecution people who actually do qualify for asylum,” said Eleanor Acer, the group’s senior director for refugee protection. The rate at which asylum is granted varies widely by a person’s country of origin and circumstances. It was approved over the past year for 10% of applicants from Honduras and 11% for people from Guatemala while the rate for people from China was 37% and 51% for petitioners from Venezuela, according to the most recent statistics from the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

0,"As The COVID-19 Pandemic Drags On, Asian Americans Are Still Being Attacked",social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As the COVID-19 pandemic stretches into yet another phase and the delta variant has created more uncertainty and anxiety, the surge in anti-Asian racism because of the coronavirus also shows no sign of abating, a new report reveals. Since March 2020, Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian American and Pacific Islander advocacy organizations and scholars, has accumulated a database of self-reported incidents of racist harassment and attacks involving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group received reports of 2,478 new incidents from April to June of this year, bringing the total number of incidents reported since early in the pandemic to 9,081, according to the data released Thursday. Given that the incidents are self-reported, the true number of racist attacks against AAPI people across the country is likely much higher. “I think we believed we were heading towards bluer skies with COVID, and that might mean less hate that Asian American community members would face,” Manjusha Kulkarni, Stop AAPI Hate co-founder and executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, told HuffPost. “But then it didn’t dissipate, and of course now, even with the disease, we’re talking about a huge surge. So looking forward, we have a lot of concerns about what that surge means in terms of the hate and discrimination.” Nearly two-thirds of the incidents were reported by women, consistent with previous patterns and reflective of the ways AAPI women routinely face a toxic combination of racism and misogyny. Throughout the time Stop AAPI Hate has been collecting these reports, the two most common kinds of incidents have involved verbal harassment and shunning or purposely avoiding AAPI people in public. Most of the incidents have taken place at businesses or on public streets. According to the data, several kinds of attacks increased between 2020 and 2021, such as physical assaults (10.8% of the incidents reported in 2020 versus 16.6% in 2021), vandalism (2.6% in 2020 versus 4.9% in 2021) and online hate incidents (6.1% in 2020 versus 10.6% in 2021). In one incident report, the respondent wrote that during a Zoom event, “a number of people hacked into the Zoom room and started disrupting my presentation with barely intelligible remarks.” One of them wrote into the Zoom chat window: “‘CHING CHONG. ASIANS DESERVES [sic] TO BE KILLED.’” Another respondent in New York City reported an incident involving “an elderly Asian grandmother using a shopping cart as a walker. A man knocked her over and then kicked her shopping cart.” Kulkarni noted that it’s possible some of the increase can be attributed to more people feeling encouraged to report their incidents of racism because of increased national attention and awareness. The group has received incident reports from every U.S. state and the District of Columbia. The two states where the greatest number of incidents have taken place are California (38.6%) and New York (16%), both of which contain large and diverse AAPI populations. “It has to be a multifaceted approach. It has to be federal, state and local governments really doubling down on protecting our communities. And so that includes driving resources to Asian American communities and creating programs to address some of the foundational issues.” Almost half of the incidents involved the perpetrator saying “at least one hateful statement regarding anti-China and/or anti-immigrant rhetoric.” In Thursday’s report, the researchers found that the rhetoric tended to fall into one or more of the following five categories, all of which have historical roots: Scapegoating China or people of Chinese descent for the spread of the virus Using racial slurs like “chink” or “gook” Reinforcing the “forever foreigner” stereotype through nativist and anti-immigrant remarks like “go back to China” Perpetuating Orientalist tropes, like “statements about Asians’ perceived cultural exoticism, such as their dietary habits (e.g. dog or bat eating) or comments about dirtiness, etc.” Red-baiting: remarks that “associate the victim with communism or socialism.” Kulkarni said she’s concerned about potential attacks targeting young AAPI people as they start going back to in-person schooling in the coming weeks. She’s also concerned about the possible ramifications of an upcoming report from U.S. intelligence officials on their investigation into the origins of COVID-19, ordered by President Joe Biden. She urged Biden and his administration to be careful of the language they use to avoid further inflaming tensions and misinformation that could lead to more racist rhetoric and scapegoating. While there’s much work to be done on many fronts, Kulkarni said she feels encouraged by some recent policy developments on the state level. For instance, California legislators allocated $156 million of the state budget toward efforts to combat anti-Asian racism. Called the Asian Pacific Islander Equity Budget, the money will fund various community organizations and will address issues such as mental health, education and restorative justice. (Stop AAPI Hate received $10 million to support its efforts tracking and responding to hate incidents.) Illinois recently became the first state to require schools to include Asian American history in their curricula. “It has to be a multifaceted approach. It has to be federal, state and local governments really doubling down on protecting our communities,” Kulkarni said. “And so that includes driving resources to Asian American communities and creating programs to address some of the foundational issues.” Read Stop AAPI Hate’s full report here.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone agreed with the federal government — which sued Abbott over the order last week — that the executive order would cause “irreparable injury” to the United States and to people the U.S. is “charged with protecting.” The temporary restraining order Cardone granted will put Abbott’s decree on hold while the courts consider the case. A temporary restraining order was just granted against Texas for Abbott's new executive order. The judge (a Bush appointee) found that the Biden administration was likely to prevail on the merits and could show irreparable injury if Abbott's order wasn't stopped. https://t.co/8w4YpQkvYt Issued last Wednesday, Abbott’s order — which immigration rights advocates lambasted as “flagrantly illegal,” unconstitutional and xenophobic — prohibited nongovernment individuals and organizations from transporting migrants released from federal custody in Texas. The order also gave the Texas Department of Public Safety authority to stop and impound any private vehicle that officers have a “reasonable suspicion” is carrying migrants — a clause that activists said could encourage racial profiling. Abbott had claimed the order was needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, the Justice Department said in its lawsuit against Abbott that his order would only exacerbate the spread of the virus because a restriction on transportation would “result in immediate backups of unaccompanied children” at federal facilities, thereby increasing the risk of transmission. Additionally, the Justice Department noted that contractors who are typically hired by the federal government to help transport sick migrants, conduct COVID-19 tests and provide safe spaces for quarantining would not be able to do their jobs under the order. “The executive order will severely disrupt the Federal Government’s efforts to carry out its responsibilities under the federal immigration laws,” the Justice Department said in its court filing. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said last week that Abbott’s order was both “dangerous and unlawful” and in violation of federal law “in numerous respects.” Responding to Garland, Abbott said in a letter that his authority “to protect noncitizens directly conflicts with my authority, and duty, to protect citizens of Texas and the United States.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,How The Pandemic Slowed Progress For Black Women’s Pay Equity,social-justice," Black Voices Editor, HuffPost Aug. 3, 2021, is Black Women’s Pay Day. It marks the day that Black women finally catch up to what non-Hispanic white men made in the year 2020. Black women make 63 cents to every dollar white men make. Viewed another way, it takes an extra eight months and three days for Black women to make what white men made the prior calendar year. According to the National Women’s Law Center, this disparity has only closed three cents in the past 30 years. It also takes Black women longer to find work than their white peers. Over the course of a 40-year career, Black women lose out on $946,120. A new report for the American Association of University Women outlines how generations of systemic injustice have directly fueled the race and gender pay gap. From the end of enslavement to de facto and de jure segregation and beyond, Black women at large have never had the privilege of economic freedom. When conversations about pay equity first began, race was left out of the discussion, ignoring the unique experiences of Black women and other women of color, Gloria Blackwell, senior vice president at the American Association of University Women, told HuffPost. She said AAUW’s latest report outlining those historical inequities aims to address that. “Even after the end of Black Americans’ enslavement, there were policies put in place to ensure that Black women and Black men didn’t have the opportunity to move ahead and/or create or build wealth in any context,” Blackwell said. Black women were working “very low-paying jobs that offered no protections ... as maids and housekeepers,” she continued. “They were working in the service industry, so the perpetuation of the low-wage hourly jobs continues to this day.” “Black women were also shuffled into industries where there were fewer protections,” Blackwell added. “There was no way for them to have health insurance or paid sick leave, ways that they were able to build any kind of wealth, no way to have a flexible work schedule.” “In over a 40-year career, Black women lose on average nearly a million dollars when you compare it to white men.” In order for there to be systemic change, Blackwell said, there needs to be “drastic policy change that keeps in mind the intersection of race and gender.” And while Black women have made some gains, the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted them. In May 2020, during the pandemic, the unemployment rate for Black women reached 16.6% and remained in the double digits for the next six months, according to NWLC’s latest report. In June 2021, their unemployment rate fell to 8.5%, but it was still 1.7 times more than their unemployment rate prior to the pandemic. Though there isn’t sufficient data to say the pandemic definitively widened the pay gap between white men and Black women, Blackwell said, “it’s been pretty clear from the research that has come out that some of the gains we’ve seen over the past several decades at least may have been erased and the pay gap itself is going to take longer to close.” Blackwell noted that most of the jobs lost during the pandemic were service jobs mentioned in the report that employ a large number of Black women, including in retail, hospitality and tourism. In addition, many Black women, especially mothers, have had to take on financial stresses related to coronavirus as the sole or primary breadwinners in their households. “So we see the pandemic as increasing the negativity around Black women’s ability to move forward in their careers, to be able to create and build wealth, to be able to have some of the flexibility and some of the career level support that are really important in a career,” she said. “Student loans figure into this as well,” Blackwell said. “We know Black women have more student loan debt overall. And many of these stop-gap measures, housing, student loans, many of these things are left to fall by the wayside and people have to start pretending that the pandemic never happened. They’re going to have an inordinate impact, a greater impact on Black women. Black women’s earning power has clearly been hurt by the pandemic, and that will certainly contribute to a widened pay gap.” “Black women’s earning power has clearly been hurt by the pandemic, and that will certainly contribute to a widened pay gap.” Blackwell said that though states have their own pay equity laws, it’s vital that they are enforced. She said that new policy, especially for the post-pandemic era, must focus on child care support, paid leave and protections against sexual, racial and other kinds of harassment in the workplace. Employers must be transparent, too, and provide data on who’s being paid what to identify where pay inequity exists. She added that no company should be asking about job candidates’ pay history, because “it’s another trap” that hinders women from receiving fair pay. “People talk about the pay gap in this tiny little area; they don’t understand the ramifications of what that means,” Blackwell said. “In over a 40-year career, Black women lose on average nearly a million dollars when you compare it to white men. I think there’s a lot Black women could do if they had a million dollars over that time. We could definitely chip away at the wealth gap that keeps Black women and their families constantly struggling, not just to get ahead, but to maintain and keep up.” Black Voices Editor, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Biden Admin Sues Texas For ‘Unlawful’ Crackdown On Transporting Migrants,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The Justice Department sued the state of Texas on Friday over Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order restricting the transportation of migrants. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Texas, asks the court to declare the governor’s order invalid, saying it “causes injury” to people the federal government “is charged to protect, jeopardizing the health and safety” of migrants in federal custody. Abbott’s executive order, issued Wednesday under the guise of concerns about COVID-19, prohibits anyone who isn’t a “federal, state, or local law-enforcement official” from transporting migrants released from federal custody. It also gives the state authority to stop and seize private vehicles suspected of carrying migrants. The Biden administration’s lawsuit notes that the federal government often uses contractors who may not be law enforcement officials to transport migrants, including unaccompanied children, from Border Patrol to Health and Human Services facilities or to nonprofits where children stay until they can be reunified with family or other sponsors pending immigration proceedings. And migrants released by Border Patrol often use privately arranged transportation like buses or trains to get to where they’ll be staying as their cases move through immigration courts, the suit notes, as well as to get to ICE appointments or court appearances, as they must by law. In a letter Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called Texas’ order “dangerous and unlawful.” Immigration rights advocates slammed it as unconstitutional and xenophobic. On Friday, the Justice Department also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, asking the judge to put the executive order on hold while the suit moves through the courts.

11,Georgia Man Gets Life Sentence After Pleading Guilty To 4 Asian Spa Killings,social-justice," CANTON, Ga. (AP) — A man accused of killing eight people, mostly women of Asian descent, at Atlanta-area massage businesses pleaded guilty to murder Tuesday in four of the killings and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. Robert Aaron Long, 22, still faces the death penalty in the other deaths, which are being prosecuted in another county. The string of shootings at three businesses in March ignited outrage and fueled fear among Asian Americans, who already faced increased hostility linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Many were particularly upset when authorities suggested Long’s crimes weren’t racially motivated but born of a sex addiction, which isn’t recognized as an official disorder. Cherokee County prosecutors had planned to seek the death penalty but decided a plea deal would bring swift justice and avoid any lengthy appeals. That’s what the victims and their families who they were able to contact wanted, District Attorney Shannon Wallace said. Bonnie Michels’ husband of 24 years, Paul, was the first person killed. “A part of me died with him that day,” she told the judge. “I am shattered.” Elcias Hernandez Ortiz, who was shot in the face, also addressed the court, saying it’s been very hard for his family. “Honestly, this man, why didn’t he think before killing so many people? I only want justice,” he said through a Spanish translator. On March 16, Long shot and killed four people, three of them women and two of Asian descent, at Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County. A fifth person was wounded. Long then drove to Atlanta, where he shot and killed three women at Gold Spa before crossing the street to Aromatherapy Spa and killing another woman, police said. All of the Atlanta victims were of Asian descent. In Atlanta, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said she intends to seek the death penalty. There, Long faces charges of aggravated assault and domestic terrorism in addition to murder. Wallace reiterated Tuesday that Cherokee County investigators saw no evidence of racial bias. Long walked through the first spa “shooting anyone and everyone he saw” and told detectives he was motivated by a sex addiction. “This was not any kind of hate crime,” Wallace said during the hearing. Investigators interviewed people who knew Long for years, including three of Asian descent, who said they’d never heard him make racist comments, she said. Her team also considered the diversity of the people shot in Cherokee County. They included a Hispanic man and a white man and woman. Asian American community leaders said Tuesday they were concerned that the shootings continue to be blamed on a sex addiction. Long’s crimes were “intended to target Asian people, specifically Asian women,” said state Rep. Bee Nguyen, the first Vietnamese American to serve in the Georgia House and a frequent advocate for women and communities of color. Wallace said she would have argued at trial that Long was motivated by gender bias, though that wouldn’t have extended his sentence. Prosecutors in Fulton County, where all the victims were women of Asian descent, have said they believe Long was motivated by race and gender. They plan to seek a hate crime sentencing enhancement. Georgia’s new hate crimes law doesn’t provide for a stand-alone hate crime. After a conviction on an underlying crime, a jury determines whether it was motivated by bias, which carries an additional penalty. The American Psychiatric Association doesn’t recognize sex addiction in its main reference guide for mental disorders. While some people struggle to control sexual behaviors, it’s often linked to recognized disorders or moral views, said David Ley, clinical psychologist and author of “The Myth of Sex Addiction.” Long previously underwent inpatient and outpatient treatment for sex addiction, Wallace said. In fact, it was another patient who gave him the idea to seek sexual services at massage businesses, she said. Long signed a plea agreement admitting to all charges in Cherokee County, including malice murder, felony murder, attempt to commit murder and aggravated assault. Cherokee County Superior Court Chief Judge Ellen McElyea then handed him four sentences of life without parole plus an additional 35 years. Those killed in Cherokee County: Michels, 54; Xiaojie “Emily” Tan, 49; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Delaina Yaun, 33. The Atlanta victims were: Suncha Kim, 69; Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; and Yong Ae Yue, 63. Long said he planned to kill himself that day and went to the massage businesses thinking that paying for sex — which he considered shameful — would push him to do it. But while sitting in his car outside the first spa, he decided to kill the people inside. After he was caught in south Georgia, Long told detectives he struggled with pornography and sex. He believed he was an addict and felt tremendous guilt when he viewed porn or engaged in sexual acts at massage businesses, Wallace said. Long blamed the victims for his inability to control his impulses, Wallace said. Long is scheduled for arraignment next month in Fulton County. His Cherokee County lawyers said in a statement they hope prosecutors there will follow Wallace’s example and reach a similar plea agreement. Wallace said that after the shootings at the two Atlanta spas, Long intended to carry out similar crimes in Florida. By then, his parents had called authorities after recognizing their son in images from security video that authorities posted online. His parents were already tracking his movements through an application on his phone so they would know if he visited massage businesses, the prosecutor said, and that enabled officers to find him. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Martin in Savannah and Sudhin Thanawala in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ This story has been updated to correct that the shooting happened in March 2021, not 2020."
12,Judge Orders Biden Administration To Suspend DACA Program,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost A federal judge in Texas ruled Friday that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― a policy that lets undocumented immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as minors stay in the country ― is illegal and must be suspended. In his ruling, Judge Andrew Hanen ordered President Joe Biden’s administration to stop approving new DACA requests from such immigrants, referred to as “Dreamers,” once again upending the Obama-era policy Biden had just revived in January. The decision by Hanen, an appointee of former President George W. Bush known for his harsh rulings on immigration matters, does not have any bearing on current DACA recipients, nor does it affect their ability to renew their DACA grants. In his ruling, he deemed DACA an “illegally implemented program” and stated that “the public interest of the nation is always served by the cessation of a program that was created in violation of law and whose existence violates the law.” Hanen also writes that the presence of DACA recipients “contributes to a more competitive labor market, which makes it more difficult for legal residents of Texas to obtain work.” But economists have long said there’s no evidence of such a problem, and DACA recipients may even provide a boost to the economy, as they are likely be employed in higher-skilled jobs. President Barack Obama created DACA in June 2012, and the program has withstood multiple legal challenges and President Donald Trump’s attempt to kill it in the time since. It is open to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 and were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012, when the program was created. There are more than 616,000 current DACA recipients. While they will not be affected by the decision, many others in their same situation will ― those who are already eligible but have yet to apply, and those who are aging into the program. DACA has been life-changing for recipients, who were newly eligible for work permits and deportation reprieve under the program. DACA recipients were able to get better jobs, start their own businesses, buy cars and houses, and more as a result of the policy, according to studies. Immigration activists spoke out against Friday’s decision and said DACA protections must be enshrined in law, not left to the judicial system. “This ruling is wrong and is subject to appeal. But Dreamers’ futures shouldn’t be in the hands of the courts,” Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “It is absolutely urgent that Congress acts now through the budget reconciliation process to provide Dreamers and other undocumented members of our communities with reliable status and a pathway to citizenship.” The president of FWD.us, another immigration group, echoed that sentiment. “Today makes absolutely clear: only a permanent legislative solution passed by Congress will eliminate the fear and uncertainty that DACA recipients have been forced to live with for years.” Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

ICE Can Get Their Data.,social-justice," Center for Public Integrity Center for Public Integrity This story is co-published with the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington, D.C. As Mayra Raymundo drives to work each evening, she obsessively checks her rearview mirror. She’s terrified a cop will pull her over and find out she doesn’t have a driver’s license or car insurance. She would have to admit she is undocumented, risking deportation to Guatemala. Raymundo, 31, works nights cleaning a private school outside Providence, Rhode Island. She earns $11.50 an hour. Without a car, Raymundo said she can’t earn a living to support her two young daughters. “Basically, if you have a car, you can find work. If not, then no,” said Raymundo, adding that she could land a job that pays $15 an hour if she had a driver’s license. “Without a license, I live in constant fear.” Raymundo and two of her co-workers, also undocumented, said they prayed for state lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow them to obtain licenses. Rhode Island legislators have tried to pass this bill for more than 10 years. Sixteen states, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., allow undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses or similar IDs known as driving privilege cards, eliminating the chance of arrest for driving without a license, a common fast-track to deportation. More places are considering this approach, as research shows earlier adopters reduced the likelihood of hit-and-run accidents, lowered insurance costs for drivers, increased the number of insured motorists on roads and improved poverty rates. But immigration authorities are using driver’s license data to find the very people who are supposed to benefit from the new laws. At least seven states have shared personal information from drivers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since January 2020, according to a Center for Public Integrity investigation. Sometimes, immigration agents will ask motor vehicle agency staff to run a facial recognition search to match a provided photo. Other times, they seek addresses and driving records for specific people. Agents often say these immigrants are suspects in crimes, but sometimes agents are searching for people they believe committed only a civil immigration infraction, such as overstaying a visa. Some immigrant rights groups now question whether it’s too risky for undocumented immigrants to get licenses. “There’s still a lot of work to do to ensure information is protected,” said Mayra Cedano, executive director of Comunidades Unidas, a Utah nonprofit that works closely with undocumented families. “A lot of folks in our communities said, ‘I won’t risk it. I won’t renew to risk being deported just to drive.’” Public Integrity asked every jurisdiction that allows undocumented individuals to drive how they handle requests from ICE. Their laws or internal policies varied widely, and some refused to explain them. Most don’t require proof that ICE investigations relate to criminal activity rather than civil immigration infractions. When ICE requests cite child exploitation, drug trafficking or other such investigations, these states grant them, taking them at face value. Only four states — New Jersey, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington — require ICE agents to produce a court order or arrest warrant signed by a judge before handing over someone’s personal data. At least two other states — California and Hawaii — passed laws explicitly prohibiting motor vehicle departments from sharing information solely related to immigration enforcement with ICE. Some of the other jurisdictions — like Washington, D.C. — did not share privacy policies but said they are committed to protecting drivers’ personal information. And ICE said it does not use license information to target people to deport. But Public Integrity found that ICE has requested information solely for immigration enforcement in some cases over the last year and a half. And advocates say they doubt jurisdictions can be sure the agency won’t use driver’s license data to track down undocumented immigrants who have committed no crimes. “You have to trust that ICE has internal safeguards in place, that they won’t use the information for immigration,” said Diane Burkley Alejandro, lead advocate for ACLU People Power Fairfax. “But does it happen? … Who knows.” In California, for instance, a DMV spokesperson said ICE “must agree” not to use personal information for immigration enforcement. The DMV counts on ICE to follow these rules and granted all 141 requests from the agency in the last year and a half. In Utah, which has a similar policy, Comunidades Unidas’ Cedano said some undocumented immigrants’ fears about what the government will do with their information has kept them from applying for driving privilege cards. The 31,000 people with driving cards last year, according to data from the Utah Department of Public Safety, represent a drop of about 7,000 in the past decade. Delaware and Vermont, meanwhile, allow their motor vehicle departments to give information to ICE solely for immigration enforcement. And in Oregon and Maryland, ICE can directly access statewide law enforcement databases, including driving records. No request required. “It shouldn’t be a risk to get a driver’s license.” A spokesperson for the Oregon State Police, which manages the statewide law enforcement database, did not answer repeated questions about whether the state prohibits ICE from accessing data for investigations that do not involve criminal activity. Maryland’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services referred that question to ICE’s parent, the Department of Homeland Security. ICE did not respond to a request for comment about that. ICE accessed Maryland’s law enforcement database – which contains drivers’ personal information – over 4,800 times in the past year and a half. ICE also conducted 37 facial recognition searches through the state’s Image Repository System. Maryland did not clarify how many of these incidents involved drivers’ license data, again referring the question to Homeland Security. “It shouldn’t be a risk to get a driver’s license. ... It makes me mad that people will have to think about data, that their information can be given to ICE,” said Juan Manuel Guzman, state advocacy director of the youth-led immigrant rights group United We Dream. He said he got his license in Maryland in 2014 when the state allowed undocumented immigrants to do so. “Whenever you give agencies — it could be ICE, it could be the CIA — free rein and unchecked power, they can go through so much data and use it dangerously,” he said. “I think it’s extremely concerning.” As more states began permitting undocumented immigrants to drive, federal immigration authorities began contacting state motor vehicle departments to help identify someone in a photo or to see if a person was living under an alias. A 2019 Washington Post investigation found that ICE and the FBI submitted thousands of facial recognition requests to state motor vehicle departments between 2015 and 2019. In Utah alone, dozens of searches were marked as having returned a “possible match.” It’s unclear how many of those requests involved criminal activity. In May 2020, ICE published a report claiming it has a policy against agents requesting facial recognition searches unless they involve people suspected of criminal activity. The report says ICE supervisors regularly review these requests. A spokesperson for ICE declined to say whether this is a new policy and, if so, when it went into effect. He said the agency does not make these requests simply to target individuals for deportation. “Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE may use DMV data in support of ongoing criminal investigations, or to confirm information regarding individuals who are considered a priority for the agency,” Mike Alvarez, the spokesperson, said in an email. But Public Integrity found that ICE requested information from at least three states’ motor vehicle departments for immigration enforcement — all after the date of the agency’s 2020 report. ICE requested an individual’s address history, criminal history, traffic violation history and a photograph in September 2020 from the Connecticut Intelligence Center, which stores personal data from the state’s department of motor vehicles. The person was suspected of entering the country illegally, which is a civil infraction. The center denied the request. In December 2020, ICE requested information from Washington state’s licensing department without stating the crime the individual allegedly committed. The department denied the request. Colorado’s DMV received nine ICE requests related only to immigration enforcement in 2020, denying all of them. For a handful of other states, including Maryland and Oregon, there’s no way to know. State Sen. Curt Bramble, a Utah Republican who sponsored the bill to grant driving privilege cards in that state in 2005, said it doesn’t bother him if ICE uses driver’s license data to track down undocumented immigrants. He said the driving cards benefit both undocumented community members, who can legally drive, and law enforcement, who can identify those breaking the law. “There’s a reason why in the federal code that the legal term is ‘illegal alien,’” Bramble said. “The individuals have chosen to violate our immigration laws.” He said advocates have never contacted him to express concern over this information sharing with ICE. Utah’s Department of Public Safety’s public information officer, Lt. Nick Street, first told Public Integrity that ICE agents requested information solely for immigration enforcement at least twice in 2021, and DPS granted their requests. Street said the department believed the requests were related to “U visa inquiries,” in which undocumented immigrants are victims of crimes and help law enforcement investigate the activity. Street later said these requests had to do with criminal activities aside from immigration enforcement. They were among almost 230 information requests from ICE that the public safety department granted in the past year and a half. Allowing undocumented individuals to get driver’s licenses has economic benefits: Licensed drivers are more likely to purchase vehicles and other bigger-ticket items, including homes. More cars are registered and insured. With an increased ability to commute to better jobs, undocumented people can contribute more to the economy. Poverty declines at a faster rate in states with these policies, according to a 2016 report from Roger Williams University’s School of Law and Latino Policy Institute. Karla Reyes, 34, is a mother of four and a chef at a Little Caesars in Virginia. Her husband, Rosendo Martinez, is a landscaper who recently received his driving privilege card. He was paid $180 a day but got a $20 raise after he got his license. Now he makes $200 a day,” Reyes said through an interpreter. Ovidia Castillo works as a housekeeper in Virginia. It takes an hour to get to the first house of the day: She doesn’t have a driving privilege card yet and must rely on her employer to get her there with up to five other women. Castillo, 41, is a single mother to a 16-year-old son. She can’t wait to pass her driving safety course and start her own housekeeping business, gaining control of her schedule and more free time to spend with her son. “My time does not belong to me,” Castillo said through an interpreter. “It feels like I don’t have feet.” Once she can drive, Castillo will no longer need $14 taxi rides to and from evening English classes four days a week. She will be able to take her son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, to local educational programs too inconvenient by public transportation, where he can socialize with other children his age. “When I have the independence to drive myself and my son where we need to go, it’ll feel like winning the lottery,” she said. Getting licenses in order to learn English is a common theme in undocumented communities. Guzman, the undocumented advocate who got his license in Maryland, said he was able to drive to community college and learn English in the evenings. His family got better job opportunities. “My family works in construction and cleans houses, and for us to be able to liberate ourselves from sometimes very abusive employers has been wonderful,” Guzman said. “They know you don’t have any other option, and it’s really awful when you don’t have another option.” In Virginia, undocumented immigrants tried for years to persuade state lawmakers to allow them to drive. The bill finally passed in April 2020, after Democrats gained control of the Legislature, and went into effect in January. The bill was first introduced years ago by a Republican who represents a conservative, rural area in southern Virginia. Marketed as an economic and safety incentive, the bill was proposed to ensure undocumented farmworkers could produce food for the state, said Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights. Advocates celebrated when the law was passed. But they saw it as a first step because it didn’t place restrictions on sharing personal data. At the time, General Assembly leadership wasn’t in favor of such restrictions, said Alejandro, with ACLU People Power Fairfax. “It was then a strategic choice to listen to community members, who were telling us that they understood the risks and wanted licenses anyway,” Alejandro said. “It was better to have licenses without complete protection than to not have licenses at all.” Legislators passed a data protection bill separately in March that went into effect July 1. The legislation in Rhode Island would have included some of the country’s strongest data-sharing restrictions. The law would have prohibited state agencies from handing over information to immigration authorities unless ICE could provide an arrest warrant or a court order. Rhode Island’s Senate voted 28-10 in favor of allowing undocumented immigrants to drive, but House leadership decided not to take up the bill before the session ended in June. That’s as far as the measure has ever gotten, and proponents plan to try yet again. But Raymundo has to get to work now. Night after night, she’s still looking over her shoulder as she drives. Kimberly Cataudella and Alexia Fernández Campbell are reporters at the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington, D.C. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story included a table that did not define “driver data” or “DMV records.” Both refer to drivers’ names, addresses and photographs.

14,"ICE To Limit Detention Of Pregnant, Nursing And Postpartum Immigrants",social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Immigration and Customs Enforcement should no longer detain most immigrants who are pregnant, nursing or have given birth within the past year under a new directive that reverses former President Donald Trump’s harsh policies. There were 13 pregnant women in ICE custody as of Thursday who are now being considered for release, officials told The Washington Post. The Hill first reported Friday on President Joe Biden’s administration’s memo with the new guidance. During Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration, no presumption of release was offered for pregnant women. Trump did away with a Barack Obama-era directive for ICE to “generally” not detain pregnant women, barring “extraordinary circumstances or the requirement of mandatory detention.” The Biden guidance goes even further than the Obama policy by also including people who are within a year of giving birth or are nursing. The new memo to ICE officers from the agency’s acting director, Tae Johnson, states that “[g]enerally ICE should not detain, arrest or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,” according to The Hill. ICE has a long ― and concerning ― history of alleged mistreatment of pregnant detainees. Some have told lawyers they were denied timely treatment after having a miscarriage. The number of women who miscarried in ICE custody nearly doubled under Trump, the Daily Beast reported in 2019. People in detainment and doctors have also reported that women have been shackled during pregnancy and postpartum. Johnson’s new memo bars the use of restraints on pregnant women, except in extreme circumstances. ICE officers must obtain permission from a superior to request detention of a pregnant or nursing immigrant, the memo states. It also orders the agency to collect and track data on pregnancy among detainees. Women who enter ICE custody are routinely given a pregnancy test. “ICE is committed to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system and preserving the health and safety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals,” Johnson said in a statement. “Given the unique needs of this population, we will not detain individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist. This reflects our commitment to treat all individuals with respect and dignity while still enforcing our nation’s laws.” Human rights groups applauded the decision, although they called for further steps to protect immigrants. Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney with the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the directive “a welcome step in the right direction.” “This move brings us closer to more humane treatment by ICE of people who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing,” Cho said in a statement. “ICE should stop detaining or arresting people who would be at particular risk in detention, must implement robust oversight of detention facilities, and ensure the release of all people who would be particularly vulnerable in detention.” Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Farmworkers Demand Basic Safety After Working In Extreme Heat Wave,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Farmworkers are calling on Congress to pass basic safety standards to protect them from extreme heat after a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest killed hundreds of people, including an undocumented worker in Oregon. “Farmworkers are imperiled by a perfect storm of deadly plagues: Extreme summer temperatures fueled by climate change… field workers disproportionately afflicted by the coronavirus… and too many live in daily dread of deportation, afraid to complain about abuse and mistreatment due to their immigration status,” said Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers union, in a press call Thursday. As temperatures soared above 100 degrees in Washington, Oregon and California amid a record-breaking heat wave last week, hundreds died from the heat. Sebastian Francisco Perez, a Guatemalan undocumented farmworker in St. Paul, Oregon, was one of them. “We’re tired of going to vigils and funerals for those who have died,” Romero said. “The time for action is now.” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) enacted temporary emergency rules Tuesday, requiring employers to provide shade, water and breaks to outdoor workers — but advocates want such protections to be permanent, and nationwide. There is currently no federal standard for working conditions during extreme heat. Only three states — California, Washington and Minnesota — have regulations to protect workers from heat. Earlier this year, Democrats introduced the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, which would ensure basic rights like access to water and paid breaks in the shade. It was named in honor of Asunción Valdivia, a California farmworker who died in 2004 after picking grapes for 10 hours straight in 105-degree temperatures. It is very hot. 🥵#WeFeedYou pic.twitter.com/Jf5q6G2yCj Most of the nation’s 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented, and their lack of legal immigration status makes them more vulnerable to workplace abuses, as they’re more hesitant to make demands of their employers. Many farmworkers also only get paid for what they pick, rather than a steady rate per hour, making them reluctant to take time off or even breaks out of fear of losing much-needed pay, said Bruce Goldstein, the president of advocacy group Farmworker Justice. In Oregon, an average annual salary for a farmworker can come out to $19,000 to $24,000 per year — less than minimum wage, according to Reyna Lopez, executive director of farmworker group Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. Leticia, an undocumented farmworker in Washington who spoke on Thursday’s press call, said that she’s been working for over 14 years picking cherries, apples, pears and grapes. Last week, she was out in the fields in temperatures around 115 degrees. While her employer gave workers the choice to finish the day early, it was the workers who decided together to break once they couldn’t handle the heat anymore — “if it were up to the farmers, probably we would have kept working,” Leticia said, explaining that they didn’t have enough water or shade to not risk their health. “Us farmworkers are often scared to demand our rights because of our immigration status,” the mother of four said. “We’re scared they’re going to cut our hours or even lose our jobs.” Democrats introduced bills to fast-track citizenship for undocumented essential workers and provide a pathway to citizenship to farmworkers specifically. But with only a slim Democratic majority in the Senate, it’s unclear if these efforts can pass. “They call us ‘essential,’” Leticia said, referring to the term to describe those who kept working as millions stayed home in the pandemic. “We wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning to harvest the food you put on your tables. We’re asking Congress: We deserve a pathway to citizenship.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,New England Community Reels After Double Murder Appears To Be A Hate Crime,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The first time The Boston Globe wrote about Nathan Allen, less than a year ago, it was a love story, describing his “perfectly executed” wedding proposal and a “marriage set against the backdrop of a killer pandemic.” On Sunday, the Globe wrote about him a second time: Allen allegedly “executed” two Black people, in the words of the Suffolk County district attorney, in what was being investigated as a hate crime, before being gunned down by police. “Allen died Saturday after exchanging gunfire with a Winthrop police sergeant who had responded to the chaotic scene, which unfolded in front of terrified residents, including children,” the Globe reported. Rachel Rollins, the district attorney, announced investigators had found “troubling white supremacist rhetoric” handwritten by Allen. “This individual wrote about the superiority of the white race,” she said in a statement. “About whites being ‘apex predators.’ He drew swastikas.” A law enforcement source told HuffPost these messages were found in “notebooks,” but wouldn’t elaborate further. It’s unclear where police found the notebooks. The seaside Boston suburb of Winthrop is now home to yet another makeshift memorial for those killed in an alleged American hate crime, made up of flowers, candles and photos of the departed: Ramona Cooper, 60, an Air Force veteran, and David Green, 68, a retired Massachusetts state trooper. Another community is reeling, searching for answers for how this could have happened here, and also knowing that of course this could have happened here. This, when it happens, always happens to people and places it shouldn’t. Yesterday, retired Massachusetts State Trooper David Green and Air Force Staff Sergeant Ramona Cooper were murdered in Winthrop by a man who drew swastikas and handwrote messages about whites being superior and “apex predators.” pic.twitter.com/kBRt6Wmwtv These days, perpetrators of such heinous crimes often leave behind evidence of their hatred online: racist posts on social media, trolling chats on Gab or 8chan, maybe even a “manifesto.” But Allen’s digital footprint appears apolitical and mundane: an Instagram account full of pictures of his wife and their pet rabbit, Puff; a LinkedIn account describing a blossoming career as a physical therapist; and a Facebook account he used only one week ago to wish his wife a happy birthday. Of the dozens of his Facebook friends contacted by HuffPost — many of whom had made recent posts celebrating Pride, or showing support for Black Lives Matter — most didn’t respond or declined to talk about Allen. One acquaintance, who knew him from Wareham High School down on the South Shore, remembered him as “a pretty normal kid” with a family that “was very loving and sweet.” Another acquaintance said they were “blindsided” by the news of what he did. Only the Globe could find someone, one of Allen’s neighbors, who described him as a “little off.” When a Globe reporter buzzed Allen’s apartment, “a woman answered a call from the building’s lobby, but quickly hung up,” the newspaper reported. “This shooter was married and employed,” Rollins said in her statement. “He had a Ph.D. and no criminal history. To all external sources he likely appeared unassuming. And then, yesterday afternoon he stole a box truck, crashed it into another vehicle and a property, walked away from the wreckage interacting with multiple individuals and choosing only to shoot and kill the two Black people he encountered.” In a press conference Monday, Rollins emphasized that Allen was “working alone” and that there is no longer a threat. He had a license to carry a firearm, but had not been on law enforcement’s radar prior to the attack. “He had nothing in his background check,” Rollins said. The district attorney’s office is thus far keeping the full contents of Allen’s notebooks from the public. Of the information it has released, perhaps the most unique or idiosyncratic detail is that Allen described white people as “apex predators.” Researchers at Western States Center, a civil rights organization that monitors extremists, alerted HuffPost this week that on the morning of the shooting in Winthrop, there was a mention of “apex predator” in a post in an influential far-right channel on Telegram, a messaging app frequented by extremists. The post, written by an anonymous administrator of the “Boogaloo Intel Drop” channel, reacted with anger to the recent sentencing of Derek Chauvin — the white former police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, setting off a wave of anti-racist protests across the country — to 23 years in prison. “Skip the bullshit and buy ammo, get right with God, learn to become the apex predator nonwhites used to fear and respect,” the user wrote. Later that day, a few hours after Allen allegedly shot and killed Cooper and Green in Winthrop, an administrator for the “Boogaloo Intel Drop” channel announced that they would “no longer post anything to this channel, but it will be maintained for archive purposes.” It seemed a sudden and surprising announcement. The channel had been a fixture in the far-right ecosystem for a while, with The Intercept noting that it had over 6,600 members as of Jan. 6. Reached for comment, an admin claimed the “Boogaloo Intel Drop channel” was abandoned because it had been “banned on Google and IOS devices” and that it would continue to “serve as a backup and archive for our other channel.” Stephen Piggott, a program analyst at the Western States Center, thinks it’s possible Allen may have made the “apex predator” post. “If the shooter posted the message, it would point to a clear motive for the attack,” he told HuffPost. “The message is essentially a call for white people to launch a race war. If the shooter was the author, the post can be read as a short-form manifesto.” It’s also possible that Allen was in the channel and just saw the post that morning. For the time being, there is no evidence directly connecting Allen to the “apex predator” post in the Boogaloo Intel Drop channel. (The district attorney’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment as to whether the Telegram post was part of its investigation.) Although the phrase has been used in neo-Nazi message boards before, it’s not all that common. As time passes, the details of what led Allen to steal a truck, crash it into a house and then kill two people will likely come into focus. For now, his alleged hate crime is the latest in a horrifying string of far-right murders. Since 2015, according to an analysis from The Washington Post, there have been 267 plots or attacks by far-right extremists in America, leading to 91 deaths. Cooper, the Air Force veteran, worked at the local Veterans Affairs office and was a “caring and selfless” woman, her son told WCVB NewsCenter 5. Green, the retired state trooper, whose neighbor described him as “sweet and kind” to Boston 25 News, reportedly spent the last moments of his life running to the scene where the truck crashed into the house, wanting to help.

1,Supreme Court Says No Right To Hearing For Some Immigrants,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the government can indefinitely detain certain immigrants who say they will face persecution or torture if they are deported to their native countries. Over the dissent of three liberal justices, the court held 6-3 that the immigrants are not entitled to a hearing about whether they should be released while the government evaluates their claims. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that “those aliens are not entitled to a bond hearing.” The case involves people who had been previously deported and, when detained after re-entering the United States illegally, claimed that they would be persecuted or tortured if sent back. One man is a citizen of El Salvador who said he was immediately threatened by a gang after being deported from the U.S. An immigration officer determined that the immigrants had a “reasonable fear” for their safety if returned to their countries, setting in motion an evaluation process that can take months or years. The issue for the court was whether the government could hold the immigrants without having an immigration judge weigh in. The immigrants and the Trump administration, which briefed and argued the case before President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, pointed to different provisions of immigration law to make their respective cases. Alito, in his opinion for the court, wrote that the administration’s argument that the relevant provision does not provide for a bond hearing was more persuasive. In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer saw it differently. “But why would Congress want to deny a bond hearing to individuals who reasonably fear persecution or torture, and who, as a result, face proceedings that may last for many months or years...? I can find no satisfactory answer to this question,” Breyer wrote. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, had ruled in the immigrants’ favor, but other appellate courts had sided with the government. Tuesday’s decision sets a nationwide rule, but one that affects what lawyers for the immigrants called a relatively small subset of noncitizens."
2,Venezuela Migrants Crossing U.S. Border In Record-High Numbers,social-justice," DEL RIO, Texas (AP) — Marianela Rojas huddles in prayer with her fellow migrants, a tearful respite after trudging across a slow-flowing stretch of the Rio Grande and nearly collapsing onto someone’s backyard lawn, where, seconds before, she stepped on American soil for the first time. “I won’t say it again,” interrupts a U.S. Border Patrol agent, giving orders in Spanish for Rojas and a dozen others to get into an idling detention van. “Only passports and money in your hands. Everything else — earrings, chains, rings, watches — in your backpacks. Hats and shoelaces too.” It’s a frequent scene across the U.S.-Mexico border at a time of swelling migration. But these aren’t farmers and low-wage workers from Mexico or Central America, who make up the bulk of those crossing. They’re bankers, doctors and engineers from Venezuela, and they’re arriving in record numbers as they flee turmoil in the country with the world’s largest oil reserves and pandemic-induced pain across South America. Two days after Rojas crossed, she left detention and rushed to catch a bus out of the Texas town of Del Rio. Between phone calls to loved ones who didn’t know where she was, the 54-year-old recounted fleeing hardship in Venezuela a few years ago, leaving a paid-off home and once-solid career as an elementary school teacher for a fresh start in Ecuador. But when the little work she found cleaning houses dried up, she decided to uproot again — this time without her children. “It’s over, it’s all over,” she said into the phone recently, crying as her toddler grandson appeared shirtless on screen. “Everything was perfect. I didn’t stop moving for one second.” Last month, 7,484 Venezuelans were encountered by Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border — more than all 14 years for which records exist. The surprise increase has drawn comparisons to the midcentury influx of Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro’s communist rule. It’s also a harbinger of a new type of migration that has caught the Biden administration off guard: pandemic refugees. Many of the nearly 17,306 Venezuelans who have crossed the southern border illegally since January had been living for years in other South American countries, part of an exodus of nearly 6 million Venezuelans since President Nicolás Maduro took power in 2013. While some are government opponents fearing harassment and jailing, the vast majority are escaping long-running economic devastation marked by blackouts and shortages of food and medicine. With the pandemic still raging in many parts of South America, they have had to relocate again. Increasingly, they’re being joined at the U.S. border by people from the countries they initially fled to — even larger numbers of Ecuadorians and Brazilians have arrived this year — as well as far-flung nations hit hard by the virus, like India and Uzbekistan. U.S. government data shows that 42% of all families encountered along the border in May hailed from places other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — the traditional drivers of migratory trends. That compares with just 8% during the last sharp increase in migration in 2019. The Border Patrol recorded more than 180,000 encounters in May, a two-decade high that includes migrants’ repeated attempts to cross. Compared with other migrants, Venezuelans garner certain privileges — a reflection of their firmer financial standing, higher education levels and U.S. policies that have failed to remove Maduro but nonetheless made deportation all but impossible. The vast majority enter the U.S. near Del Rio, a town of 35,000 people, and they don’t try to evade detention but rather turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents to seek asylum. Like many of the dozens of Venezuelans The Associated Press spoke to this month in Del Rio, 27-year-old Lis Briceno had already migrated once before. After graduating with a degree in petroleum engineering, she couldn’t get hired in the oil fields near her hometown of Maracaibo without declaring her loyalty to Venezuela’s socialist leadership. So she moved to Chile a few years ago, finding work with a technology company. But as anti-government unrest and the pandemic tanked Chile’s economy, sales plunged and her company shuttered. Briceno sold what she could — a refrigerator, a telephone, her bed — to raise the $4,000 needed for her journey to the U.S. She filled a backpack and set out with a heart lock amulet she got from a friend to ward off evil spirits. “I always thought I’d come here on vacation, to visit the places you see in the movies,” Briceno said. “But doing this? Never.” While Central Americans and others can spend months trekking through the jungle, stowing away on freight trains and sleeping in makeshift camps run by cartels on their way north, most Venezuelans reach the U.S. in as little as four days. “This is a journey they’re definitely prepared for from a financial standpoint,” said Tiffany Burrow, who runs the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition’s shelter in Del Rio, where migrants can eat, clean up and buy bus tickets to Miami, Houston and other cities with large Venezuelan communities. They first fly to Mexico City or Cancun, where foreign visitors are down sharply but nearly 45,000 Venezuelans arrived in the first four months of 2021. Smugglers promoting themselves as “travel agencies” have cropped up on Facebook, claiming to offer hassle-free transport to the U.S. in exchange for about $3,000. “We’re doing things the way they do things here — under the table,” a smuggler said in a voice message a migrant shared with the AP. “You’ll never be alone. Someone will always be with you.” The steep price includes a guided sendoff from Ciudad Acuna, where the bulk of Venezuelans cross the Rio Grande. The hardscrabble town a few hundred wet steps from Del Rio is attractive to both smugglers and migrants with deeper pockets because it had been largely spared the violence seen elsewhere on the border. “If you’re a smuggler in the business of moving a commodity — because that’s how they view money, guns, people, drugs and everything they move, as a product — then you want to move it through the safest area possible charging the highest price,” said Austin L. Skero II, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol’s Del Rio sector. But the number of smugglers caught with weapons has recently increased in the area, and agents who normally hunt down criminals are tied up processing migrants. The uptick in migrants crossing is “purely a diversion tactic used by the cartels” to carry out crime, Skero said as a group of Haitians carrying young children emerged from a thicket of tall carrizo cane on the riverbank. Once in the U.S., Venezuelans tend to fare better than other groups. In March, Biden granted Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 320,000 Venezuelans. The designation allows people coming from countries ravaged by war or disaster to work legally in the U.S. and gives protection from deportation. While new arrivals don’t qualify, Venezuelans requesting asylum — as almost all do — tend to succeed, partly because the U.S. government corroborates reports of political repression. Only 26% of asylum requests from Venezuelans have been denied this year, compared with an 80% rejection rate for asylum-seekers from poorer, violence-plagued countries in Central America, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. “I can write their asylum requests almost by heart,” said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, who has represented over 100 Venezuelans. “These are higher-educated people who can advocate for themselves and tell their story in a chronological, clean way that judges are accustomed to thinking.” Even Venezuelans facing deportation have hope. The Trump administration broke diplomatic relations with Maduro when it recognized Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader in 2019. Air travel is suspended, even charter flights, making removal next to impossible. Meanwhile, as the migrants leave Del Rio to reconnect with loved ones in the U.S., they are confident that with sacrifice and hard work, they’ll get an opportunity denied them back home. Briceno said that if she had stayed in Venezuela, she would earn the equivalent of $50 a month — barely enough to scrape by. “The truth is,” says Briceno, hustling to catch a bus to Houston where her boyfriend landed a well-paying oil industry job, “it’s better to wash toilets here than being an engineer over there.”"
3,"Kamala Harris Visits U.S.-Mexico Border, Defends Timing Of Trip",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southern U.S. border in El Paso, Texas, on Friday, where she once again emphasized that her main goal as immigration czar is to resolve what’s causing Central American migrants to seek refuge to the U.S. in the first place. Her trip included a tour of an El Paso migrant processing center, a visit to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, and a conversation with five young girls from Central America. “We are here today to address and to talk about what has brought people to the U.S. border and again to continue to address the root causes that cause people to leave and often flee their home country,” Harris told reporters. This is her first visit to the U.S.-Mexico border since President Joe Biden tapped her to handle the administration’s immigration policies in March. Though she’s visited Guatemala and Mexico on immigration-focused trips since then, Republican critics have been dogging her to visit the border and accused her of being unfit for the role. Harris responded to some of that criticism on Friday. “An important aspect of this visit is leading this visit after the work that we did in Guatemala and Mexico, because as I’ve long said ― I said back in March I was going to come to the border, so this is not a new plan,” she said when a reporter asked why she was making the visit now. “The reality of it is that we have to deal with causes, and we have to deal with the effects,” she continued. “So being in Guatemala, being in Mexico, talking with Mexico as a partner, frankly, on the issue was about addressing the causes. And then coming to the border ... is about looking at the effects of what we have seen happening in Central America.” Harris’ visit comes as the Biden administration grapples with soaring numbers of migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras — all places where the U.S. has played an integral role in exacerbating inequality and corruption — showing up at the border seeking asylum. More than 180,000 migrants arrived in May, according to Customs and Border Protection, and more than 112,000 were immediately expelled. “As you all have heard me say many times, I strongly believe that most people don’t want to leave home,” Harris said at a press conference wrapping up her visit, adding that migrants do so because they can’t provide “basic necessities” for their families in their home countries. “That belief has been reinforced throughout our day today,” she said. “The stories that I heard, the interactions that we had today, reinforced the nature of those lack of economic opportunities ― very often violence, corruption and food insecurity, and basic needs not being met, including the fear of cartels and gangs.” As more migrants have come to the souther border, the Biden administration has continued a policy instituted under former President Donald Trump that denies asylum on the basis of protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, Harris urged migrants not to try to enter the U.S. right now. The vice president said Friday that much work still needs to be done to “build a fair and functional and humane immigration system,” adding that Biden’s administration “inherited a tough situation,” thanks to Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Kamala Harris To Visit U.S.-Mexico Border Amid Republican Backlash,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Fending off unabated criticism from Republicans about her failure to visit the U.S.-Mexico border since being tapped as immigration czar, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly plans to visit a stretch of the boundary this week. Harris will arrive in El Paso, Texas, on Friday alongside Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, her office confirmed. No other information about the visit was immediately available. News of Harris’ visit comes as she faces relentless criticism from Republicans that she’s unfit for the role because she has not visited the border since Biden tapped her in March to handle the rapidly accelerating flow of Central American migrants seeking refuge in the U.S. “Despite being in the midst of a border crisis this country has not seen in two decades, Vice President Harris has not yet shown adequate interest in observing this crisis first-hand,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said in a letter to Biden signed by 56 House lawmakers last week. NEW: @VP Harris will travel to El Paso, Texas on Friday, June 25. pic.twitter.com/uruHBUE5la Conservative outlet Fox News has been keeping a tally of the number of days she’s gone without a border visit. Harris has pushed back against that narrative, saying her focus is on addressing the lack of stability in the countries from where migrants are fleeing. She highlighted that approach during a visit to Guatemala earlier this month. “I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home,” Harris said at a press conference after meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. “At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come.” But her words were met with frustration from within her own party, too. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said it was “disappointing to see” and noted that the U.S. has played an integral role in destabilizing the countries in question and exacerbating corruption and inequality there, including in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Criticism of Harris comes as the Biden administration grapples with soaring numbers of migrants showing up at the border seeking asylum. More than 180,000 migrants arrived in May, according to Customs and Border Protection, and more than 112,000 were immediately expelled. Though Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives have argued that it’s legal to seek asylum, the Biden administration has continued to lean on a Trump-era order from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that lets the U.S. quickly turn away migrants in the name of public health. Former President Donald Trump is also slated make an appearance at the border soon, as he announced last week he had accepted an invitation from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to visit the border with him on June 30. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Money Is Piling Up For America's Family Dynasties,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The wealth of America’s 50 richest family dynasties has soared at 10 times the rate of typical U.S. families over the last four decades, according to a new study that warns of the increasing concentration of riches. The report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, found that the collective wealth of the richest 27 families on the Forbes billion-dollar dynasties list and Forbes 400 list grew by 1,007% from 1983 to last year, from $80.2 billion to $903.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. Wealth grew less than one-tenth of that — just 93% — for the typical American family. The five wealthiest family dynasties — the Waltons, Kochs, Marses, Cargill-MacMillans and Lauders — saw their wealth soar 2,484% since 1983, noted the study, “Silver Spoon Oligarchs: How America’s 50 Largest Inherited-Wealth Dynasties Accelerate Inequality.” The 50 wealthiest U.S. clans were worth a total of $1.2 trillion at the end of last year. The 65 million families at the bottom economic half of all households shared a combined total of just $2.5 trillion. The study noted that wealth among America’s richest family dynasties ends up vastly rewarding family members who had nothing to do with earning the fortune, defying the defense that riches are an incentive for hard work and innovation. Instead, the riches are plowed into protections for family wealth, providing fewer benefits for society. “In healthy, equitable democratic societies, great fortunes dissipate over a few generations as initial wealth holders have children and grandchildren, pay their fair share of taxes, and make charitable gifts,” the report says. “But our country’s wealth is accumulating in fewer hands, including among people who may be up to seven generations removed from the original source of their family’s wealth. At a certain stage, some of these wealth holders — or their descendants — shift resources to consolidate their wealth, fend off competition, and create monopolies.” Even the coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for some of the richest families. As ordinary families struggled with job loss, plunging income and increased health costs, the top 10 families on the Forbes dynasty list basked in a median growth in their net worth of 25%. In the first two months of the pandemic, the total net worth of more than 600 billionaires in the U.S. grew by 15%, or $434 billion, according to a report last year by the Institute for Policy Studies. In 2018, the wealth gap between the rich and everyone else was the widest ever since the census began tracking it a half-century ago. Check out the new Institute for Policy Studies report here.

12,Black Immigrants Are Still Fighting Racism In The U.S. Immigration System,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Yacouba, a political activist in Ivory Coast, knew if he didn’t immediately flee his home country, he wouldn’t survive. After being threatened, attacked and tortured by people sympathetic to those in power, Yacouba fled his country in 2018. He went to Brazil for a few years, then made a perilous trek through Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico before finally arriving in the United States. The journey was one of the two most challenging periods of his life. The second was being detained as a Black immigrant in the U.S. As the nation celebrates Juneteenth — a day commemorating the emancipation of African Americans who had been enslaved in the United States — as a federal holiday for the first time, Black Americans and immigrants are fighting to dismantle institutional racism, including within the immigration system. Black immigrants are disproportionately detained, receive higher bond costs, and say they face racist treatment within detention centers. Recognizing and celebrating the emancipation of slaves is vital, activists say ― but continuing to take down systemic racism needs to come with it. “From an immigration perspective, Black immigrants face disproportionate levels of detention and exclusion,” Diana Konate, policy director at the advocacy group African Communities Together, said Thursday on a press call. “These can be life-threatening, as Black immigrants often get deported back to unsafe and dangerous conditions. While we celebrate the victories, we keep in mind that a lot of work remains.” More than 40 million Black Americans reside in the U.S. More than 4.2 million are Black immigrants, most of whom were born in the Caribbean or African nations, and that number is only growing, according to a 2018 Pew Research Study. Although Black native-born Americans and Black immigrant communities have their differences, both contend with high levels of discrimination and the lingering impacts of slavery and institutionalized racism. “The reality is, as we are celebrating, we want to take the time to honor our ancestors who paid the price for us to be here as a Black immigrant, an immigrant descendant of slaves,” said Guerline Jozef, the executive director of a coalition to help Haitian immigrants called the Haitian Bridge Alliance. “I understand and honor those who have come before.” In 2018, former President Donald Trump referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” when discussing immigration, according to people in the room. He then attempted to terminate temporary protected status, or TPS, for Haitians, although he was blocked in court. Last month, Joe Biden’s administration announced that it would be extending TPS for eligible Haitian immigrants, a win celebrated by immigration advocates. But there is more to be done, Jozef said. She called on the administration to provide protections for Black immigrants coming from countries such as Cameroon, the Bahamas and Mauritania. “Immigration is a Black issue. Immigration is a racial issue. Immigration is a social justice issue, and as a Black woman, I cannot separate my immigration status away from my Blackness,” Jozef said. “So as we continue to celebrate, with our brothers and sisters on this Juneteenth, we will also continue to push for liberation and freedom for all people.” Yacouba, who is being referred to with a pseudonym because he fears retaliation, was immediately apprehended by immigration officials when he crossed the southern border in October 2020. He has since been held at the South Texas Detention Complex as he waits for the asylum office to review his case. He hasn’t been able to see his fiancee, who also immigrated to the U.S., or meet his daughter, who was born while he was in detention. Yacouba, who suffers from asthma and chronic sinusitis, said his requests to see a doctor are frequently dismissed, and that others have been released quickly while he remains detained. “I thought that discrimination and racism were over in America. In fact, it is not. It has changed face, but it is still there.” “I know it is because I am Black. If I had been white, they would not have done that with me,” Yacouba said. “I felt horrible. I thought that discrimination and racism were over in America. In fact, it is not. It has changed face, but it is still there.” Yacouba said he began to have suicidal thoughts while detained. He said he sought help from a psychiatrist through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but was instead put in solitary confinement without his asthma medications and was not given the ability to speak with his attorney. An ICE spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency was firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody but did not elaborate further. On this Juneteenth, Yacoba is wondering whether the U.S. is truly progressing on the issue of racial equity. “I feel completely trapped. All I want is to be with my family and my child,” he said. “Why is it always that Black people must suffer so much?” Reporter, HuffPost"
13,18 Died Of COVID-19 In Texas Prisons After Winning Parole: Report,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost At least 18 people died of complications from COVID-19 in Texas prisons during the first 12 months of the pandemic after they had been approved for parole, a heartbreaking study has discovered. An additional two dozen inmates granted parole died behind bars largely due to chronic health issues unrelated to COVID-19, according to research published Thursday by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs of the University of Texas at Austin. “Despite being approved for parole, some [inmates] will never walk out the prison gates because they die while waiting for release,” noted the report, titled “Dead Man Waiting.” A “substantial period of delay between parole approval and parole release is built into the current design of the Texas parole system,” it added. That delay has been particularly deadly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisoner rights advocates pleaded in vain with state officials beginning last year to immediately release those who had been approved for parole as the pandemic raged through prisons across America and killed hundreds in Texas lockups. At any given time in the Texas system, thousands of inmates have already been approved for parole. But they must first complete rehab, treatment or life skills training before they can be freed. Some wait to be released for more than a year until they can complete those requirements. Delays increased during COVID-19 when pre-release programs were postponed, The Texas Tribune reported. “Some of these people were eligible [for release] months and months and months ago, and they’re still there,” Jorge Renaud, southwest regional director of policy and advocacy for LatinoJustice, told the outlet last year. “They are putting these people at risk unnecessarily.” Before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, a person granted parole remained in prison an average of three to four months before being released, according to the report. Afterward, typical delays jumped to five to 11 months. Eleven people who died in prison during the pandemic had been approved for parole more than a year earlier, according to the report. Even prior to COVID-19, people have died in Texas prisons each year after technically winning their freedom. A total of at least 26 people died in prison in 2019 after having been granted parole, the study noted. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, at least 18 people who had already been granted parole died of the virus before they could leave. “While COVID has dramatically exacerbated this problem, the data also tells us that this phenomenon is not unique to the pandemic era,” the report stated. In April, about 10,800 people held in Texas prisons — some 9% of the entire prison population — had already been approved for parole, according to data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. More than one-quarter of them had been granted parole at least six months earlier. Nearly 900 people had been waiting for more than a year to be released, according to the study. In 2019, less than one-quarter of people granted parole were released immediately. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott (R) resisted pleas to release parolees more quickly or allow prisoners to finish sentences in home detention like Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen was allowed to do. “Releasing dangerous criminals in the streets is not the solution” to the virus threat in prisons and jails, Abbott said. Today I issued an Executive Order preventing the@release of dangerous criminals from prisons & jails. We want to prevent the spread of #COVID19 among prison staff & inmates. But, releasing dangerous criminals in the streets is not the solution. #txlege #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/GEEB4icIUj A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,"Kid Rock Spews Homophobic Slur, Flips Off Audience For Filming Him",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Kid Rock is making headlines again for, well, being Kid Rock. On Saturday, the “Only God Knows Why” singer casually used a homophobic slur while performing at Fishlipz Bar & Grill in Smithville, Tennessee, which was caught on film and obtained by TMZ. The musician appeared to be annoyed by audience members filming him with their phones. In the video, Kid Rock looks directly into one phone and sings, “Fuck your iPhone, yeah!” He then flips off the person filming him. Continuing to sing, he then steps onstage, signals to his crotch and croons: “You can post this, you can post this, you can post this dick right now.” He then added the slur, which is censored in the video: “You fucking f****ts with your phones out!” This latest spite-fueled outburst follows a string of recent and unflattering headlines involving the musician. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, Kid Rock initially refused to close his Nashville bar, despite a closure mandate by the city’s mayor. In May, Kid Rock also showed support for musician Morgan Wallen, who was suspended from his label and removed from country music stations after being caught on tape making a racial slur, by giving Wallen his first gig following the controversy at his bar. So it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that people were, well, unsurprised when the latest news about Kid Rock hit Twitter early this week. Many who identify as LGBTQ — and advocates — responded appropriately to the musician’s hateful outburst on Twitter by snarkily writing him off as a troll. Kid Rock caught on film entertaining Kid Rock fans. https://t.co/LhSMnS6q22 I, for one, am shocked that noted LGBTQ ally Kid Rock would say something homophobic. https://t.co/E59KBine5M When I heard Kid Rock made a homophobic comment, I got so mad I drove 12 hours to my parents house, went in the attic, found Kid Rock’s latest cassette, and threw it out.

0,Kamala Harris Tells Migrants 'Do Not Come' To U.S. Border In Guatemala Speech,social-justice," GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris offered an optimistic outlook for improved cooperation with Guatemala on addressing the spike in migration to the U.S. after her meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday. She also delivered a direct warning to migrants considering making the trek: “Do not come. Do not come.” Her comments, during a press conference after she met privately with Giammattei, underscored the challenge that remains even as Harris engages in substantive talks with the Guatemalan and Mexican presidents during a three-day visit to the region this week, her first foreign trip as vice president. “I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home,” Harris said. “At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized the U.S. stance. “This is disappointing to see,” she wrote on Twitter. “First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival. Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and them blame them for fleeing.” This is disappointing to see.First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival.Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and then blame them for fleeing. https://t.co/vADyh5H0bw In conjunction with Harris’ trip, the Biden administration announced that the Justice Department would create an anti-corruption task force and an additional task force to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling in the region. Harris also promised a new program focused on creating education and economic opportunities for girls there, among other new initiatives. And she told Giammattei that her goal in the region was to restore “hope” to residents so they no longer felt the need to flee their homeland for better opportunities in the U.S. But for all the talk about new ways to cooperate, reining in corruption and improving living conditions in the region have been long-running challenges that previous administrations have been unable to achieve in their efforts to stem the tide of migration to the United States. Part of the challenge remains that, despite the best efforts of U.S. officials, corruption underpins many of the region’s governments. Indeed, Giammattei himself has faced criticism over his handling of the issue. Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei’s administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them. And the selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and allegations of corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her. On Monday, Giammattei seemed less than eager to address those issues. Asked by The Associated Press about criticism of his record on corruption, Giammattei initially ignored the question. When pressed by another journalist to answer for the complaints against him, Giammattei seemed to bristle at the allegation that he was at fault, insisting there were “zero” allegations of corruption against him and labeling drug traffickers the biggest corruption issue in his nation. Still, Harris expressed optimism about their ability to work together, telling reporters that the two had a “very frank and very candid” conversation that included “the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary.” Harris said the Justice, Treasury and State departments would work together on anti-corruption investigations and train local law enforcement to conduct their own. “We are creating this task force to address corruption. We are working on a task force that is about human smuggling. We are doing the work of requiring certain progress be made if we are going to attract U.S. investment, private investment, to this region,” Harris said.

1,Biden Taps Groups To Help Pick Asylum-seekers To Come To U.S.,social-justice," SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration has quietly tasked six humanitarian groups with recommending which migrants should be allowed into the United States to pursue asylum as it faces mounting pressure to lift public health rules that have barred people from seeking protection. The consortium of groups is determining who is most vulnerable out of those waiting in Mexico to get into the U.S., and the criteria they are using has not been made public. It comes as large numbers of migrants are crossing the southern border and the government has been rapidly expelling them from the country under a public health order instituted by former President Donald Trump and kept in place by President Joe Biden during the coronavirus pandemic. Several members of the consortium revealed details about the new system to The Associated Press. The government is aiming to admit up to 250 asylum-seekers a day who are referred by the groups, agreeing to that system only until July 31. By then, the consortium hopes the Biden administration will have lifted the public health rules, though the government has not committed to that. So far, nearly 800 asylum-seekers have been let into the country since May 3, and members of the consortium say there is already more demand than they can meet. The groups have not been publicly identified except for the International Rescue Committee, a global relief organization. The others are London-based Save the Children; two U.S.-based organizations, HIAS and Kids in Need of Defense; and two Mexico-based organizations, Asylum Access and the Institute for Women in Migration, according to two people with direct knowledge who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not intended for public release. Asylum Access, which provides services to people seeing asylum in Mexico, characterized its role as minimal. The effort started at the border in El Paso, Texas, and is expanding to Nogales, Arizona. A similar but separate system led by the American Civil Liberties Union began in late March and allows 35 families a day into the United States at places along the border. It has no end date. The twin tracks are described by participating organizations as an imperfect transition from so-called Title 42 authority, named for a section of an obscure 1944 public health law that Trump used in March 2020 to effectively end asylum at the Mexican border. With COVID-19 vaccination rates rising, Biden is finding it difficult to justify the expulsions on public health grounds and faces demands to end it from the U.N. refugee agency and members of his own party and administration. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it’s in “close coordination with international and non-governmental organizations in Mexico” to identify vulnerable people and that it has the final say on who gets in. The agency described its work with the groups as fluid and said it hasn’t identified them to avoid giving them exposure. Some consortium members are concerned that their offices in Mexico could be mobbed by asylum-seekers, overwhelming their tiny staffs and exposing them to potential threats and physical attacks from extortionists and other criminals. Critics of the new selection processes say too much power is vested in a small number of organizations and that the efforts are secretive without a clear explanation of how the groups were chosen. Critics also say there are no assurances that the most vulnerable or deserving migrants will be chosen to seek asylum. The consortium was formed after the U.S. government asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ office in Mexico for the names of organizations with deep experience and capacity in Mexico, said Sibylla Brodzinsky, a U.N. office spokeswoman. “We’ve had long relationships with them and they’re trusted partners,” she said. The groups say they are merely streamlining the process but that the vulnerable migrants’ cases can come from anywhere. In Nogales, Arizona, the International Rescue Committee is working with local organizations and using a program that connects to migrants via social media and smartphones to find those “facing extreme life-threatening situations,” said Raymundo Tamayo, the group’s director in Mexico. It plans to refer up to 600 people a month to U.S. officials. Special consideration is being given to asylum-seekers who have been in Mexico a long time, are in need of acute medical attention or who have disabilities, are members of the LGBTQ community or are non-Spanish speakers, though each case is being weighed on its unique circumstances, Tamayo said. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said advocacy groups are in “a very difficult position because they need to essentially rank the desperation” of people, but he insisted it was temporary. The government, he said, “cannot farm out the asylum system.” The most vulnerable migrants may be too scared or uninformed to bring attention to themselves, said Margaret Cargioli, managing attorney for Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that got involved with the ACLU-led effort after “more organizations became aware of it.” She called the approach a “Band-Aid” while the health rules remain in place. Migration experts not involved in the process have questioned why the government has not been more transparent. “It has been murky,” said Jessica Bolter, an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who believes the administration is quietly trying to be humane without encouraging more people to come, a balancing act she doubts will succeed. “Setting out clear and accurate information about how and who might get in might lead to fewer migrants making the trip, so there’s not this game of chance that kind of seems to be in place right now,” Bolter said. U.S. border authorities recorded the highest number of encounters with migrants in more than 20 years in April, though many were repeat crossers who had previously been expelled from the country. The number of children crossing the border alone also is hovering at all-time highs. Against that backdrop, some advocates are seeing the makings of the “humane” asylum system that Biden promised during his campaign. Details have been elusive, with administration officials saying they need time. Susana Coreas, who fled El Salvador, was among those identified as vulnerable and allowed into the United States last month. Coreas spent more than a year in Ciudad Juarez waiting to apply for asylum but was barred by the public health order. She and other transgender women refurbished an abandoned hotel to have a safe place to stay after they felt uncomfortable at a number of shelters in the rough Mexican city and got help from the International Rescue Committee. But they continued to have problems. One transgender woman had a knife pointed at her. Another had a gun pulled on her. “There was so much anxiety,” Coreas said. “I now feel at peace.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Facebook To End Policy Giving Politicians Free Rein To Post Hate Speech,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Facebook is set to end its policy that largely gives politicians carte blanche to break content rules against hate speech, a dramatic shift after years of largely leaving such posts alone because of their newsworthiness, according to several reports. When the change, first reported by The Verge, takes effect, politicians will be required to adhere to the company’s guidelines that prohibit harassment, discrimination or harmful posts. Facebook has already instituted policies meant to curb misinformation and false news, including removing posts that make false claims about COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The shift, which Facebook reportedly plans to announce on Friday, comes after the social media giant indefinitely banned former President Donald Trump from posting following his efforts to inflame supporters before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Facebook Oversight Board upheld the suspension last month, but gave the company six months to determine if the response was “proportionate.” (The company does not currently list indefinite suspensions as part of its policies, The Washington Post notes.) Trump has called his ban “a total disgrace” and threatened that the company, and others like Twitter, would “pay a political price.” Twitter took a similar stance with its own ban on Trump, and has also instituted policies that hide offensive or abusive messages behind a warning label, or designating them as misinformation. Facebook had largely refused to moderate politicians’ posts since at least 2016, saying in 2019 that such comments are newsworthy and that the company would, as a “general rule,” leave them up to be “seen and heard.” Also in 2019, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was adamant the company wouldn’t police political speech. “The long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,” Zuckerberg said during a speech at Georgetown University at the time. “I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.” The Verge and other outlets reported that Facebook plans to publicly share some details about how it penalizes accounts that break content rules, including letting users know when they do so. It will also share how it uses newsworthiness exemption to leave controversial posts untouched. Facebook has been on the defensive since banning Trump. Florida last month became the first state to announce it would fine social media companies that permanently bar political candidates there.

3,"Biden Urged To Protect Central Americans From Deportation Over Climate, Violence Concerns",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Immigrants and their advocates are calling on the Biden administration to grant protections from deportation to Central Americans who have fled their countries due to poverty, violence and catastrophic hurricanes. In a Thursday press call, immigrant rights groups Alianza Americas and Presente.org urged President Joe Biden to grant a new temporary protected status designation to four Central American countries — Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras — which would allow immigrants from those nations to live and work legally in the U.S. on a temporary basis. Some immigrants from the latter three countries already have existing TPS status, generally given to refugees of war or disaster, until it is safe to return to their countries. But as of now, it only lasts until October. Guatemalans have no such protection. The immigrant groups are calling for a new designation — rather than an extension or renewal of the existing ones — to allow new applicants from the three countries to seek protection, as well as Guatemalans. Over the past year, Central Americans have not only had to face the hardship of the COVID-19 crisis, but the region was also severely damaged by deadly hurricanes Eta and Iota last fall, on top of existing long-term crises that include high rates of poverty and violence. Currently about 195,000 people from El Salvador have temporary protected status in the U.S., as well as some 57,000 people from Honduras and 2,500 from Nicaragua. Without a new designation, thousands of immigrants from those countries and Guatemala could face deportation to the nations they fled due to economic hardship, violence or climate change. “I’m asking President Biden to provide TPS status so we can work with dignity without fear of being deported,” Ana Ortiz, an undocumented domestic worker from El Salvador, said in Spanish. The mother of two fled El Salvador due to intimate partner violence and poverty. 🔊 NEW TPS for Central American nationals NOW! Join @PresenteOrg & @ALIANZAAMERICAS & call on @POTUS & @SecMayorkas to grant a new TPS designation Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador & Guatemala! ➡️ https://t.co/IRlsKFzZYI #TPSJustice The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last month, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to tens of thousands of Haitians in the U.S., who can now live and work here legally for at least another year and half. On the press call Thursday, immigration advocates celebrated the action, and called for Biden to do the same for Central Americans. Last November, devastating back-to-back hurricanes, Eta and Iota, slammed Central America, leading to dozens dying in mudslides in Guatemala, tens of thousands of homes being destroyed across the region, and half a million people being displaced from their homes. The destruction of climate change added to existing issues in the region, such as El Salvador facing a serious gang violence problem, with one of the highest homicide rates in the world. On the press call, 29-year-old Alexandra Yulieth Mejia, a single mother of two from Honduras, described fleeing Honduras due to poverty after the devastation of hurricane Eta. One of her daughters was experiencing stomach pain that doctors in her country couldn’t treat. After a dangerous journey on a migrant train route called “La Bestia” and then walking through the desert with little food or water — “I thought I was going to die,” she said in Spanish — she finally got to New York, where doctors gave her daughter a liver transplant. They told Mejia that if her daughter hadn’t received it, she might have had only one year to live. “It’s a question of life or death,” Mejia said of receiving status to stay here. TPS would allow her to work legally, send money to her grandmother who raised her and has health issues in Honduras, and study to become a nurse. Advocates pointed out that temporary protected status is just that — temporary — and requires regular renewals for immigrants to stay protected from deportation. They are calling on Congress to provide a path for all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to obtain permanent residency. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Police Investigate Bomb Threat At Palestinian Center In New Jersey,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Local police are investigating dozens of vulgar calls that overwhelmed a Palestinian community center in New Jersey on Tuesday and included Islamophobic and misogynistic rhetoric, as well as death threats and threats of sexual abuse. Members of the all-female staff at the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton said they had opened the facility on Tuesday to begin the new semester of its Arabic program for children, prepare for an advocacy meeting with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and get “ready to continue serving our great community.” “Unfortunately, we instead were all met with violent anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic rhetoric, all coupled with [vulgar] misogyny and threats of sexual abuse,” the center said in a statement. According to the statement, the center received about 30 calls from 11:50 a.m. until the facility closed at 6 p.m. local time. Staff said the calls at one point came from two male individuals, the main one identifying himself as “Jebediah Morris.” In initial calls that day, the same man stated, “You guys aren’t even a real country,” in reference to Palestine. The caller then repeatedly told the staff not to “blow up any buildings because that’s what you people do,” and threatened to sexually assault and rape staff members to “give [you] a taste of your own medicine.” The caller first claimed to be from “Brunswick” before later saying that he “lives nearby so [I] should come over there and beat the shit out of you.” The caller sometimes used a private number to block his name and location, and other times the caller ID indicated he was phoning from Texas. The man asked multiple times if the staff were Palestinian, and when asked why that mattered, he said it was “so I know to come blow you up.” He accused PACC of being a terrorist organization. Asked where he had received such information, he referred to the Israeli government and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Recordings of the calls were shared with The Record and NorthJersey.com, and the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) released videos including some of the threats that PACC staff had captured. “Most important for us right now is for people to recognize how layered this incident is,” Abire Sabbagh, PACC community engagement coordinator, said in a statement. “It’s heavily politically charged, and anti-Palestinian, as well as extremely misogynistic.” “This did not come out of nowhere ― this comes from the country’s blind political, financial, and moral support to Israel. What happens abroad affects what happens to our communities here, and right now we’re most concerned about the beautiful and diverse community we serve ― especially the most vulnerable within, our women and children.” Clifton police responded to the scene after staff members reported the first wave of calls and had a patrol car outside the center on Tuesday, with an officer inside for some of the later calls. As of Wednesday morning, the center has decided to remain open with consistent security in place for the rest of the week. “PACC staff are rightfully shaken up, but are empowered by the strength and support of the community,” the center said. “Like our people and homes in Palestine, we will not be intimidated, we are not going anywhere, and trust us, we will prevail.” Police have launched an investigation into the incident. However, detective Lt. Robert Bracken, commander of the Clifton Police Department’s detective division, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for an update on the probe. The Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office is also investigating the incident as a bias crime. The New Jersey chapter of CAIR filed a complaint about the threats with the FBI, which would not comment to HuffPost on the specifics of a potential investigation. The FBI told CAIR-NJ on Tuesday that it would look into the calls and that it is in contact with the state’s homeland security office, which is also aware of the bomb threats targeting PACC. The FBI said it would call CAIR-NJ back, but the chapter’s executive director, Selaedin Maksut, said the organization has not heard from the bureau since Tuesday. .@CAIRNJ @MSelaedin: “Our office has filed a complaint with the FBI and expects a formal investigation to follow immediately. We urge the FBI and state law enforcement authorities to take domestic terrorism threats seriously and to ensure the safety of PACC’s members."" #Gaza “Propaganda in support of Israeli apartheid and brutality that demonizes Palestinians provides fertile ground for anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim hatred here in America,” Maksut said in a statement. “This propaganda, adopted by some New Jersey elected officials, gives a false sense of entitlement to those ― like the racist caller ― who make violent threats against Palestinian community members.” “Calling out anti-Palestinian hatred and Islamophobia is not controversial,” Maksut continued. “New Jersey elected officials must be loud and clear in their condemnation of this violence.” Booker, who had an upcoming meeting with PACC staff, tweeted on Wednesday that Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian hate “have no place in our state, our nation ― or anywhere.” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) also tweeted that he is “appalled” by the threats of violence against the center. “These violent and vile threats are unacceptable,” Booker said. “We must all speak up and call out hate in all its forms.” The Israeli government and Palestinian militant group Hamas fought for 11 days last month, causing widespread destruction in Gaza and killing more than 250 people, most of whom were Palestinians and many of whom were children. While the two groups eventually reached a cease-fire, the effects of the massacre carried over into the U.S., which has seen an uptick of both anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim crimes. Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Biden Administration Formally Ends Trump's 'Remain In Mexico' Program,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration formally ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” program, which had forced tens of thousands of Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico in often dangerous conditions for their claims to be processed. In a memo Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the program, also known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), after the Biden administration paused it earlier this year for a review. In January, the Biden administration suspended any new enrollments of asylum-seekers into the program and since February has processed over 11,000 people previously enrolled into the U.S., according to Mayorkas’ memo. Since the Trump administration issued the policy in January 2019, about 68,000 asylum-seekers were forced to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court cases, many in dangerous situations where they faced violence, sexual assault, kidnapping and more. “This is a huge victory. The forced return policy was cruel, depraved, and illegal, and we are glad that it has finally been rescinded,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Judy Rabinovitz said in a statement. Rabinovitz, who led the ACLU team that previously sued the Trump administration over the policy, urged the Biden administration to ensure “everyone who has been subjected to this policy can now pursue their asylum cases in the United States, in safety and without additional trauma or delay.” DHS Secretary Mayorkas formally ends the Trump-era Remain-in-Mexico policy.Among other reasons, Mayorkas cites concerns about whether ""lack of stable access to housing, income, and safety"" forced asylum-seekers in Mexico to abandon ""potentially meritorious protection claims."" pic.twitter.com/Jrwzc4srfk In the DHS memo, Mayorkas wrote that after Biden directed him to review the program in February, he’d considered whether it processed asylum-seekers “ in a safe and orderly manner consistent with the Nation’s highest values.” The DHS secretary noted that some of those forced to remain in Mexico faced a “lack of stable access to housing, income, and safety.” A 2019 report from Doctors Without Borders condemned the Trump-era policy for leaving people to stay “in violent areas of Mexico and [putting] them in extreme danger.” Of the nearly 400 patients the group treated in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo in the first five months of that year, more than 45% had endured at least one episode of violence as they waited to cross into the U.S., including about 12% who had been kidnapped. A separate report from Human Rights Watch detailed how in Ciudad Juárez, Central American migrants reported facing sexual assault, homelessness, kidnapping and other violence after being sent to the Mexican city under the policy. “We applaud the Biden Administration’s decision to formally end the abhorrent ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy,” said Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, and Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.), chair of the subcommittee on border security, in a statement calling the policy “a stain on our nation’s history.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Illinois Becomes First State To Pass Bill Banning Cops From Deceiving Youth Suspects,social-justice," Springfield, Ill. (AP) — Illinois became the first state Sunday to pass a bill that will ban police from lying to youth during interrogations ― a practice that adds significantly to the risk of false confessions and wrongful convictions. It is expected to be signed into law by the governor in coming weeks. The original sponsors, state Sen. Robert Peters and state Rep. Justin Slaughter, garnered bipartisan support for the bill that culminated in a near-unanimous vote to pass it in both houses. House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, a Republican and former Chicago prosecutor, joined as a co-sponsor and helped propel the bill’s passage. “I’ll never be accused of being soft on crime, but I’m more interested in seeking the truth than a conviction,” Durkin said. “I believe in fair play. We should never tolerate, under any circumstance, the use of deception to seek a statement or an admission by any defendant, let alone a juvenile.” Police officers should not be able to lie to kids for their own gain, period. It’s a disgusting practice and I’m glad that my colleagues in the General Assembly agree.General Assembly approves Peters’ ban on deceptive practices against minorsRead more: https://t.co/eeKBcNWQpl pic.twitter.com/pPpoaTsvoC Though few Americans realize it, police regularly deceive suspects during questioning to try to secure confessions, from saying DNA placed them at the scene of a crime to claiming eyewitnesses identified them as being the perpetrator. Detectives also can lie about the consequences of confessing, saying, for instance, that admitting responsibility is a quick ticket home. Minors ― who have been found to be two to three times more likely to confess to crimes they didn’t commit ― are especially vulnerable to such pressure tactics, said Laura Nirider, co-director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, who consulted on the bill together with the national Innocence Project and the Illinois Innocence Project. Though it is currently legal for police in all 50 states to lie during interrogations, Oregon and New York are considering similar legislation, said Rebecca Brown, policy director at the national Innocence Project. The Oregon bill, sponsored by a former law enforcement officer, passed the House this week and heads next to the Senate. A bill still pending in New York would apply to adults as well as minors. There, deceptive interrogation techniques have contributed to several infamous juvenile wrongful convictions, including 15-year-old Yusef Salaam of the so-called Central Park Five, now also known as the Exonerated Five. The five Black and Latino teens were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn’t commit in 1989 and served prison time before being exonerated in 2002. Illinois banned police from lying to kids because it is home to 100 false confessions, 31 from kids.An out-of-state case mattered too.“What finally put [Rep. Durkin] over the edge to sponsor the bill was learning about the case of Brendan Dassey.”https://t.co/lEgfOwYho0 Illinois has in recent years uncovered at least 100 wrongful convictions predicated on false confessions, 31 of them involving people under 18 years of age. Senate Bill 2122 was supported not only by individuals who themselves falsely confessed to crimes, but also by the state’s Chiefs of Police, the Illinois State’s Attorneys’ Association, and the Office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. “The history of false confessions in Illinois can never be erased, but this legislation is a critical step to ensuring that history is never repeated,” Foxx said in a press release. “I hope this is a start to rebuilding confidence and trust in a system that has done harm to so many people for far too long.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Joe Biden Signs Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Bill Into Law,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law on Thursday, a response to the sharp rise in anti-Asian violence over the past year during the coronavirus pandemic. “There are simple core values that should bring us together as Americans — one of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation,” Biden said at the White House ahead of the signing, telling legislators in the room that today, “you’ve taken a first step.” The president added that many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have “lived here for generations and are still considered by some the ‘other.’” “It’s wrong,” Biden said. “My message to all of those who are hurting is, ‘We see you.’” The legislation from Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) would expedite the review of COVID-19-related hate crimes and direct law enforcement to improve how people can report such incidents, as well as better collect data and expand public awareness campaigns about hate crimes. The bill overwhelmingly passed in the Senate in April and in the House earlier this week. Since last year, Asian Americans have reported a surge in racist violence, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders rose by 150% in major U.S. cities, according to one study. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, recorded some 6,600 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans from March 2020 through March 2021. People reported being targeted with racial slurs, spat on and physically assaulted. Women made up nearly two-thirds of those who reported being attacked. In her own remarks ahead of the signing, Vice President Kamala Harris said: “History will remember this day and this moment, when our nation took action to combat hate.” “It did not come from nowhere, none of it is new. In my life, in my lived experience, I have seen how hate can pervade our communities,” said Harris, who is the first Asian American and Black vice president. “The work to address injustice wherever it is remains ahead.” Today is a great day for President Biden to sign into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and help #StopAsianHate. https://t.co/OjlrGwVe5h Joining @SpeakerPelosi & @SenSchumer at the congressional bill signing ceremony for my #COVID19 Hate Crimes Act which seeks to help combat the ongoing hate & violence against #Asian Americans.

Not as ‘them,’ but as ‘us,’” Harris said at another event Wednesday on AAPI unity. “As a member of this community, I share in that outrage and grief.” Hirono introduced the new legislation after a white man shot eight people dead — including six women of Asian descent — at massage spas in Georgia in March.

14,U.S. Ends Use Of 2 Immigration Jails Accused Of Mistreatment,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — A detention facility in Georgia where women claim they were subjected to unwanted medical procedures and a Massachusetts jail that has drawn complaints of inhumane conditions will no longer be used to detain immigrants, the Biden administration said Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security said it would terminate contracts with the local government agency that runs the detention center in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, and with the private operator of the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia. Any detainees the U.S. believes should remain in custody will be transferred elsewhere, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in announcing the move, which had been sought by immigrant advocates. “Allow me to state one foundational principle,” Mayorkas said, “We will not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention.” Mayorkas said ending the use of the facilities is part of an effort to make “lasting improvements” to a detention system that advocates have long argued detains people for civil immigration offenses for too long and in inappropriately harsh conditions. It also reflects a broader effort to roll back the anti-immigrant policies that characterized U.S. policy under President Donald Trump. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a part of DHS, holds about 19,000 noncitizens for removal at about 200 facilities around the country, down about a quarter from a year earlier. About 73 percent of those in custody have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data-gathering organization at Syracuse University. DHS suggested additional detention facilities could close in a statement that noted that it would “review concerns” about other centers. “Today’s announcements show the Biden administration’s willingness to decisively break from the immigrants’ rights abuses of prior administrations,” said Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, which recently called for the closure of 39 immigration detention centers around the country. The ACLU has called for an end to the “default incarceration” of immigrants and an end to the agreements with state and local authorities that enable prisoners who are noncitizens to be transferred into ICE custody for deportation upon release. Mayorkas has led an effort to soften some immigration policies but has publicly insisted that noncitizens who pose a threat to the public and have committed serious crimes should be detained pending their removal from the country. The Massachusetts jail was run under an agreement with the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office. The Georgia facility was run by a private company under contract with ICE. Members of Congress and advocates have called for the closure of the Georgia facility since last year after women held there told of being forced into unnecessary gynecological procedures with dirty equipment and other unsanitary conditions. DHS and the Justice Department are investigating the allegations of medical mistreatment, which a doctor involved in their treatment has denied, and Mayorkas said that steps will be taken to preserve evidence. Immigrants held at Irwin also had broader complaints about overall conditions, alleging that authorities at the detention center failed to take adequate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Given its extensively documented history of human rights violations, Irwin should have been shut down long ago,” said Azadeh Shahshahani, legal and advocacy director for Project South, an advocacy group that has pressed for ICE and the company that runs the facility to compensate women subjected to unwanted procedures there. The facility in Ocilla, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of Atlanta, has been used to house men and women for ICE as well as inmates for the U.S. Marshals Service and Irwin County. It’s run by the private LaSalle Corrections, a Louisiana company. The company had no immediate comment to Thursday’s announcement. Immigrants held at the Massachusetts jail, known formally as the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center, have also complained about a lack of COVID-19 precautions as well as overcrowding and excessive use of force. The Massachusetts attorney general’s office issued a scathing report in December, determining that officers violated the rights of detainees and used excessive force during a disturbance there earlier in the year. A spokesman for Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who was an honorary chairman of former President Trump’s reelection campaign in Massachusetts, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Thursday. But local immigrant rights groups that have frequently clashed with Hodgson cheered the decision as long overdue. Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU Massachusetts, said Hodgson “carried out the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda with zeal.” And Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, head of Lawyers for Civil Rights, said the jail, located almost 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of Boston near Cape Cod, is “notorious for its inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of civil immigration detainees.” ___ Brumback reported from Atlanta.

15,Congress Sends Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Bill To Biden's Desk,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A bill to address the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic passed the House Tuesday afternoon, and will now head to President Joe Biden’s desk, where he is expected to sign it later this week. The bill, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), requires the Justice Department to assign a point person to expeditiously review hate crimes and reports of hate crimes in order to come up with better ways for people to report them and raise awareness of the issue. “Today, Congress sends a powerful, united message that we stand in solidarity with the AAPI community as we confront an epidemic of racism and intolerance,” Hirono said Tuesday in a tweet. The legislation also requires DOJ to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with best practices for mitigating racist language describing the pandemic. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters notoriously fanned the flames of anti-Asian hatred by referring to COVID-19 as the “Kung Flu” and “the China virus.” The bill passed the House by a 364-62 vote. It passed in the Senate in late April. Biden has already expressed support for the legislation, saying that “far too many Asian Americans have woken up each morning increasingly fearful for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.” “They have been scapegoated, harassed, and assaulted; some have even been killed,” Biden said in a statement last month. “It has been over a year of living in fear for their lives, as acts of anti-Asian bias and violence have accelerated from coast to coast — an unconscionable burden our fellow Americans have been forced to bear, even as so many Asian Americans serve their communities and our nation tirelessly on the front lines of the pandemic.” @potus was pleased to see the House pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. He looks forward to signing this important legislation into law at the White House later this week. In the Senate, support for the bill was nearly unanimous. The only nay vote came from Sen. Josh Hawley, the pro-Trump Missouri Republican who said the bill was “too broad” and gave the government too much “open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents.” Hirono introduced the legislation after a man gunned down eight people at three separate massage spas in northern Georgia in March. The dead included six women of Asian descent. Police swiftly arrested 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long en route to Florida; authorities have said he may have planned to kill more people there. The attack brought attention to the uptick in violence against Asian Americans seen over the course of the pandemic, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, where a number of doctors tried to sound alarm bells at considerable personal risk in the earliest days of the crisis. Some law enforcement authorities claimed the Georgia killings were not racially motivated, but that the suspect had had a “bad day” and a possible sex addiction ― a claim that prompted more public outcry. Activists say anti-Asian sentiment has historically been ignored or sidelined in the U.S. Over the past year, America’s largest cities have witnessed a 150% rise in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans, according to March research from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. Many attacks have targeted older people of Asian descent, such as the 61-year-old man who was critically injured in New York City last month when he was shoved to the ground and repeatedly kicked. Earlier this month, two Asian women, ages 63 and 84, were stabbed as they waited for a bus in downtown San Francisco. The violence has sparked anti-racism protests specifically addressing concerns from Asian American and Pacific Islander communities across the country. Activists have also established a campaign, Stop AAPI Hate, to bring attention to the problem. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,"U.S. Commits To Admitting About 250 Asylum-Seekers Per Day, Attorney Says",social-justice," SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration has agreed to let about 250 people a day through border crossings with Mexico to seek refuge in the United States, part of negotiations to settle a lawsuit over pandemic-related powers that deny migrants a right to apply for asylum, an attorney said Monday. The government also said it would stop flying migrant families from Texas’ Rio Grande Valley to El Paso, Texas, and San Diego to then be expelled to Mexico under pandemic powers, said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued in federal court in Washington, D.C. The government has reserved rights to resume flights “if it deems the circumstances warrant.” The government concessions would dramatically reshape exercise of powers known as Title 42, named for a section of an obscure 1944 law that former President Donald Trump used to let the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention effectively end asylum at the border while it sought to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Biden has exempted unaccompanied children from Title 42 but kept it for single adults and many families. He has come under criticism from progressives for keeping asylum off-limits to many and for encouraging some parents to send children across the border alone. Enforcement-minded critics say exempting children traveling alone led to record numbers crossing and that lifting restrictions more will invite many more people to come. The government and the ACLU agreed to “a streamlined process for assessing and addressing exemption requests brought by particular vulnerable families and other individuals,” Gelernt said. Once fully up and running, an estimated 250 particularly vulnerable individuals will be allowed in daily to seek humanitarian protection through a consortium of nongovernmental organizations. They must test for COVID-19 before entering the country. About 2,000 people have already been allowed to enter the country, exempted from the pandemic-related powers to pursue asylum or other forms of protection while in the United States, Gelernt said. “While these concessions will hopefully save lives, they are not a substitute for eliminating Title 42 and restoring asylum processing fully,” Gelernt said. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night. Immigration advocates have ratcheted up pressure to lift pandemic-related powers entirely, arguing that they cannot be defended solely on grounds of protecting public health. Migrants are typically expelled to Mexico within two hours of getting picked up by Border Patrol agents. Administration officials, while insisting that the powers are in place for public health reasons, have repeatedly said they need more time to develop the “humane” asylum system that Biden promised during his campaign. The Biden administration has been running daily flights for up to 135 people from Brownsville, Texas, to El Paso and San Diego since Mexican authorities in Tamaulipas state sharply limited the number of Central American families it would take back, citing a law in Mexico that took effect in January against detaining migrant children. Families are expelled from El Paso and San Diego, border cities where Mexican authorities have been more amenable to taking them back than in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The Border Patrol’s more than 173,000 encounters with migrants on the Mexican border in April were the highest level since April 2000, though the numbers aren’t directly comparable because more than six of 10 were expelled under pandemic-related powers. Being expelled carries no legal consequences, so many people try to cross multiple times. Authorities encountered 17,171 children traveling alone in April, down from an all-time high of 18,960 in March. There were about 50,000 people encountered in families in April. About one of every three in families was expelled to Mexico. The rest were allowed to remain in the United States to seek asylum. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,DACA Recipients Were 'Candid' With Biden About 'High Stakes' Of Immigration Reform,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden met with six recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program at the White House, where the young people expressed the urgent need for permanent protections for all undocumented immigrants. DACA recipient Maria Praeli said in a statement after the meeting that she was “enormously grateful” that Biden listened to their stories of how their families have “struggled with the broken immigration system.” “We were able to be candid with the president,” Praeli said of herself and the other DACA recipients, often referred to as “Dreamers,” who were brought to the U.S. as children. They detailed how “painful” it is to have one’s immigration status “in limbo,” Praeli said, adding that the meeting with Biden “made even clearer the incredibly high stakes of permanently protecting immigrants from deportation.” The White House said that the president “reiterated his support for Dreamers” and other “essential” immigrant workers and discussed the need for broader immigration reform. Biden has been pushing several immigration bills in Congress: one to provide permanent resident status to Dreamers and others to provide a path to citizenship for farmworkers and other undocumented immigrants. However, immigration reform efforts passed by the Democratic-led House face tough odds in the closely divided Senate.

DACA recipients have long been pushing for permanent protections not just for themselves and others brought to the U.S. as children but for all 11 million or so undocumented immigrants living in the country. “It’s extremely painful to feel so American yet know that my future in this country is not secure,” Praeli, who is a government manager at the immigrant rights group Fwd.us, told MSNBC before the meeting.

2,Amanda Nguyen’s Fight For AAPI Justice Is An Intersectional One,social-justice," Asian Americans Out Loud Amanda Nguyen’s Fight For AAPI Justice Is An Intersectional One As an Asian American and the founder of civil rights organization Rise, Nguyen knows all too well how racism and sexism can work in tandem. Asian Americans Out Loud is a project highlighting Asian Americans who are leading the way forward in art and activism. You can read more by visiting our APAHM  2021 homepage. Story By Alanna Vagianos Photography by Ting Shen When COVID-19 hit the United States in 2020, activist Amanda Nguyen’s world, like so many others, came to a complete standstill. In the midst of confusion and terror, some Americans — fueled by racist rhetoric from former President Donald Trump — believed that China was to blame for COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread, the U.S. saw an alarming uptick in anti-Asian hate incidents, including harassment and assault of Asian Americans. Many of the incidents were extremely violent. In March 2020, a man stabbed two Burmese children in a grocery store in Texas because he thought they had COVID-19. In July, an 89-year-old Asian American woman was attacked and set on fire in Brooklyn. A Filipino American man was attacked by a man with a box cutter on the New York City subway in February and had to get nearly 100 stitches across his face. Nguyen, the founder and CEO of civil rights organization Rise and a Vietnamese American, said it felt as though the country and the media were actively ignoring the rise in hate crimes against her community. “It’s a weird form of gaslighting where you’re constantly asking yourself if everybody else sees what we, the Asian community, are experiencing right now,” the 29-year-old told HuffPost. “I kept thinking, why isn’t this being covered? This is clearly a pattern.” So Nguyen decided to do what she does best: speak up. In February, she posted a video on Instagram calling out the media for not covering the deluge of hate incidents against the Asian American community. “The mainstream media does not spotlight our stories enough. We matter, and racism is killing us,” Nguyen said in the video. “Our community is being attacked, and we are dying to be heard.” A post shared by Amanda Nguyễn (@amandangocnguyen) Nguyen’s call to action quickly went viral, racking up more than 3 million views in the first 24 hours. She was invited to speak on MSNBC and CNN, and one CNN anchor even apologized to her for not covering the story sooner. As the views, likes and comments on her video steadily grew, Nguyen knew she had to do more. She went back to work to ensure that the humanity of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders wasn’t reduced to just a fleeting video on social media. On May 6, Nguyen’s organization, Rise, along with RUN AAPI, a nonprofit raising awareness on what it means to be AAPI in America, launched the Visibility Pledge to honor the community this Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The yearlong campaign aims to educate the rest of the public about Asian American heritage. People who sign the pledge get access to a module that teaches basic concepts like what is Lunar New Year as well as more historical issues, such as how the Asian American and Black communities have worked together in solidarity for decades. “The violence and discrimination that we’ve faced stems from invisibility and apathy. Therefore, the solution is visibility and empathy,” Nguyen said in a statement announcing the campaign. Rise has partnered with multiple corporations, including the NBA and Uber, to urge individuals to take the pledge to “proudly renew our commitment during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to stand with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.” In addition to the corporate pledge, Rise has partnered with Change.org to create a petition calling on states to incorporate AAPI history in American educational curriculums. Amanda Nguyen, CEO and founder of  civil rights organization Rise, works on the computer in her study in Washington, D.C. “Communities are effectively cut out of the conversation when their heritages and histories are erased,” Nguyen told HuffPost. “How can we collectively build without knowing our past? Our mistakes and our victories.” Nguyen admitted that it hasn’t been easy to continually speak out against these horrific and dehumanizing crimes. Activism burnout is real, she said. And she knows from experience. Nguyen’s journey as an activist started in 2013, when she was raped during her last year at Harvard University. After receiving little to no help from the legal system, she founded Rise, a civil rights nonprofit that focuses on protecting the liberties of sexual assault victims. In 2016, she created the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, legislation that gives victims of sexual assault basic civil liberties during the reporting process and the ensuing medical and legal proceedings. The advocate was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Next, a list of rising stars shaping the future of different industries. Nguyen has traveled around the world to speak about her activism and work, and she was a guest speaker at the 2017 Women’s March. She received the Heinz Award for Public Policy and the Nelson Mandela Changemaker Award, and she was nominated for a 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. As an Asian American woman working in the anti-sexual violence space, Nguyen is all too familiar with the intersections of racism and sexism the country is witnessing. In the last year, nearly 3,800 anti-Asian racist incidents occurred, according to research from Stop AAPI Hate, a social justice nonprofit organization that tracks anti-Asian hate. Women were the victims in nearly 70% of those incidents. Nguyen was named one of Time magazine's 100 Next, a list of rising stars shaping the future of different industries. Despite Nguyen’s intimate knowledge, she was still surprised to see how many people lacked the basic understanding of intersectional identities and intersectional justice work — especially after the Atlanta-area spa shootings in which six of the eight people who were killed were women of Asian descent. “It’s baffling to me to hear people ask, ‘Well is it racism or is it sexism?’ It’s both,” Nguyen said. “When we heard that the murderer in Atlanta said he wasn’t racist but he killed these people because he wanted to eliminate a sex addiction, that, immediately, is racism,” she continued. “And that’s because sexual violence is about power. Rape is about control. It’s about taking agency from someone’s body. You do that by objectifying people.” Through the Visibility Pledge and her advocacy at Rise, Nguyen has seen more and more people acknowledge that justice issues are inherently intersectional. She hopes her future work can continue to uplift the AAPI community and remind the country that her community matters. “The first step to healing is acknowledging that there’s a problem,” Nguyen said. “Finally, people are acknowledging that the AAPI community exists and something needs to be done to protect us.” More APAHM Stories With ‘Endlings,’ Playwright Celine Song Dove Deep Into Asian Identity.

3,Migrant Children Held In Mass Shelters With Little Oversight,social-justice," The Biden administration is holding tens of thousands of asylum-seeking children in an opaque network of some 200 facilities that The Associated Press has learned spans two dozen states and includes five shelters with more than 1,000 children packed inside. Confidential data obtained by the AP shows the number of migrant children in government custody more than doubled in the past two months, and this week the federal government was housing around 21,000 kids, from toddlers to teens. A facility at Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army post in El Paso, Texas, had more than 4,500 children as of Monday. Attorneys, advocates and mental health experts say that while some shelters are safe and provide adequate care, others are endangering children’s health and safety. “It’s almost like ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Luz Lopez, referring to the 1993 film in which events appear to be continually repeating. “Here we are back to a point almost where we started, where the government is using taxpayer money to build large holding facilities ... for children instead of using that money to find ways to more quickly reunite children with their sponsors.” A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, Mark Weber, said the department’s staff and contractors are working hard to keep children in their custody safe and healthy. A few of the current practices are the same as those that President Joe Biden and others criticized under the Trump administration, including not vetting some caregivers with full FBI fingerprint background checks. At the same time, court records show the Biden administration is working to settle several multimillion-dollar lawsuits that claim migrant children were abused in shelters under President Donald Trump. Part of the government’s plan to manage thousands of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border involves about a dozen unlicensed emergency facilities inside military installations, stadiums and convention centers that skirt state regulations and don’t require traditional legal oversight. Inside the facilities, called Emergency Intake Sites, children aren’t guaranteed access to education, recreational opportunities or legal counsel. In a recent news release, the administration touted its “restoration of a child centered focus for unaccompanied children,” and it has been sharing daily totals of the number of children in government custody as well as a few photos of the facilities. This reflects a higher level of transparency than the Trump administration. In addition, the amount of time children spend, on average, inside the system has dropped from four months last fall to less than a month this spring, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Nonetheless, the agency has received reports of abuse that resulted in a handful of contract staffers being dismissed from working at the emergency sites this year, according to an official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Attorneys say sometimes, even parents can’t figure out where their children are. José, a father who fled El Salvador after his village was targeted in a massacre, requested asylum in the U.S. four years ago. He had hoped to welcome his wife and 8-year-old daughter to Southern California this year, but the pair were turned around at the border in March and expelled to Mexico. The little girl crossed again by herself and was placed in the government shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on April 6. José called a government hotline set up for parents seeking their migrant children repeatedly but said no one would tell him where she was. “I was so upset because I kept calling and calling and no one would tell me any information about where she was,” said José, who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of endangering his immigration case. “Finally they told me I had to pay $1,300 to cover her airplane ticket and if I didn’t pay, I would have to wait a month more, and I was so anxious.” For nearly three weeks, his daughter was held inside the Brownsville facility before finally being released to him in late April after an advocacy organization intervened to get the government to foot the bill for her airfare, as is required by the agency. HHS declined to say whether there are any legally enforceable standards for caring for children housed at the emergency sites or how they are being monitored. The Biden administration has allowed very limited access to news media once children are brought into facilities, citing the coronavirus pandemic and privacy restrictions. “HHS has worked as swiftly as possible to increase bed capacity and to ensure potential sponsors can provide a safe home while the child goes through their immigration proceedings,” HHS spokesman Weber said in a statement. “As soon as wrap around services — on-site primary care, including childhood immunizations and physicals, case management, phone calls to family members, education, recreation etc — become available as a result of additional infrastructure and staff, they are provided as part of the operation.” Weber confirmed a number of specific shelter populations from the data the AP obtained. Of particular concern to advocates are mass shelters, with hundreds of beds apiece. These facilities can leave children isolated, less supervised and without basic services. The AP found about half of all migrant children detained in the U.S. are sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children. More than 17,650 are in facilities with 100 or more children. Some shelters and foster programs are small, little more than a house with a handful of kids. A large Houston facility abruptly closed last month after it was revealed that children were being given plastic bags instead of access to restrooms. “The system has been very dysfunctional, and it’s getting worse,” said Amy Cohen, a child psychiatrist and executive director of the nonprofit Every. Last. One., which works to help immigrant families fleeing violence in Central America. Although there have been large numbers of children arriving in the U.S. for years, Cohen said she’s never seen the situation as bad as it is today. Cohen described parents receiving calls from people refusing to identify themselves. They are told to be at an airport or bus station in the next two hours to pick up their children, who have been held for more than a month without notice, or they wouldn’t be released. Some parents are told to pay a travel agency thousands of dollars to have their child sent to them, she said. “The children are coming out sick, with COVID, infested with lice, and it will not surprise me to see children dying as a consequence, as we saw during the Trump years,” Cohen said. “The Biden administration is feverishly putting up these pop-up detention facilities, many of which have no experience working with children.” One reason so many children are now arriving without their parents dates back to a 2020 Trump administration emergency order that essentially closed the U.S.-Mexico border to all migrants, citing public health concerns about spreading COVID-19. That emergency order still applies to adults, but the Biden administration has begun allowing children traveling without their parents to stay and seek asylum if they enter the country. As a result, some parents are sending their kids across the border by themselves. Most already have a parent or other adult relative or family friend, known as a sponsor, in the U.S. waiting to receive them. But first they are typically detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, then turned over to a government shelter. “As much as having children spend days on end at CBP is unacceptable, so, too, is having children spend weeks on end in unlicensed Emergency Intake Sites,” said National Center for Youth Law attorney Neha Desai. “With every passing day, it is increasingly critical that these children are released to sponsors or transferred to licensed facilities.” Over the course of 2019, the federal government held nearly 70,000 children in a system of contracted shelters, mass detention camps and foster parents. This year those numbers are expected to be even higher. Some of the facilities holding children these days are run by contractors already facing lawsuits claiming that children were physically and sexually abused in their shelters under the Trump administration, while others are new companies with little or no experience working with migrant children. Collectively, the emergency facilities can accommodate nearly 18,000 children, according to data the agency provided earlier this month. “There are a lot of questions about are there standards and who is ensuring that they are meeting them, and what kind of transparency and accountability will there be,” said Jennifer Podkul, a vice president at Kids in Need of Defense, which represents children in immigration court. The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project is one of several organizations that filed legal claims against the federal government seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for parents who said their children were harmed while in government custody after being forcibly separated at the border under Trump administration policies. In some lawsuits, families claim children suffered physical and sexual abuse while in government custody, at both foster homes and private shelters. “If those children were able to come in with their parents, they could be released with their parents and not placed in government custody,” said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director at the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project. “This administration should lift the current policy in order for families to seek asylum together.” Biden’s Justice Department is defending the government against these claims, which were filed in 2019 under the Trump administration. But the federal response has been mixed since the change in leadership. Some cases continue to be argued, while others are in settlement discussions. In a recent filing in one case currently in litigation, federal attorneys agreed with the assertion that these policies indeed inflicted harm. “President Biden has ‘condemned the human tragedy that occurred when our immigration laws were used to intentionally separate children from their parents or legal guardians ... including through the use of the “Zero Tolerance Policy” during the Trump administration,’” Justice Department attorneys wrote. The judge in the case granted a joint request to pause the litigation until June 2 “while the parties explore settlement.” “We want to make sure there is adequate oversight and transparency for these new structures and make sure that children can get out,” said Podkul, whose organization has been holding “know your rights” training with children in the emergency sites. “If kids are there for more than 48 hours, kids need to know what to expect.” As for the 8-year-old girl, her father, José, said she is adjusting to life in Los Angeles, enjoying playing with her older brother and, bit by bit, opening up. “She keeps asking me where her mom is, and I keep telling her not to worry, that she is in Mexico and she is OK,” he said. “Soon I hope she’ll tell me what it was like inside.” ___ AP data journalist Larry Fenn contributed to this report.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Story By Brittany Wong Illustration by Nicole Xu Three years ago at a crowded BART station in Oakland, California, educator Catherine Shieh was waiting for a train when a man approached her, asking for spare change. When Shieh, who is Taiwanese American, told him she didn’t carry cash, the man swung his fist and knocked her over. Then he started punching her. “I was knocked over to the ground,” she told HuffPost. “I just curled up like a little ball because I didn’t want to be held liable for assault myself in case I were to defend myself.” When the flurry of punches stopped, the man shouted a message to Shieh as he ran away: “If you call the cops, I’ll find you and I’ll kill you.” “That’s had a long-lasting effect on me and the way I move through public spaces,” the San Francisco native said. “I have an incredible amount of anxiety, a little bit of agoraphobia and I struggle to take public transit, which was never really an issue for me in the past.” The incident happened on a Saturday. There were many witnesses nearby, but no one intervened or checked on Shieh. It wasn’t until a week later, when Shieh called the BART police, that she found out three strangers had called and reported the incident on her behalf. (The assailant had a history of assaulting Asian women and the elderly, the police later found out.) Looking back, Shieh said that there was part of her that felt relief there had been witnesses, ready and willing to document what they had seen. Still, she wished they had come up to her directly when she was lying on the ground, curled up in a little ball and legitimately scared. “I think there’s a difference between just reporting it quietly and actually being able to go up to the person who was just harassed to see if there’s a way that you can support and comfort them,” she said. “In these moments, you don’t always have to be direct in your interventions or interaction. Get creative: Make a loud sound or drive your car up to where the incident is happening.” Catherine Shieh, anti-hate training coordinator at Asian Americans Advancing Justice Chicago Today, Shieh teaches people to do exactly that in some increasingly popular bystander trainings she leads over Zoom. The 28-year-old is the anti-hate training coordinator at the nonprofit organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice Chicago. It’s a relatively new job; up until August, Shieh had been an ethnic studies high school teacher in Los Angeles for five years. As COVID-19 spread and anti-Asian attacks surged across the country, the Chicago nonprofit tapped Shieh to spearhead its anti-hate education efforts with the public and with private organizations. It’s a job that fuses many of Shieh’s passion points: politics and policy as well as teaching and facilitating learning in novel, creative ways. The classes ― which are attended by Asian Americans and others just looking to help ― are heavy on bystander training, but they also delve into race and the xenophobia and exclusionary laws that made Asians and Pacific Islanders the nation’s first “undocumented immigrants.” For some attendees, this might be their first exposure to a history that’s all too often given short shrift in history classes. Shieh relishes the chance to dig into it. “A lot of times I feel like this is the only type of job for me,” Shieh said. “Many people think that talking about race and identity would be difficult, but if done well, I actually find it quite liberating. I really like being a part of these conversations with people.” As attacks continue, the demand for bystander training is growing The classes, conveniently offered over Zoom for people across the country, are of course sorely needed right now. Since the beginning of the pandemic last March, there have been nearly 3,800 hate incidents reported against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, with many of the crimes occurring in the Bay Area and New York City, according to advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate. Because these numbers are self-reported and some victims may not speak English, community advocates say there are likely far more cases that haven’t been logged. In recent months, Shieh said her group has seen a huge uptick in attendance at its public trainings, which are put on in partnership with the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Hollaback!, a New York-based anti-harassment nonprofit. In early February, attendance for the virtual workshops was in the teens or dozens, she said. A recent session in April was attended by 500, the max Zoom would allow. Another training that month had over 2,800 registrations. (Shieh said those who are interested in attending a free class should periodically check the Asian Americans Advancing Justice Chicago website for new training dates.) The trainings start with a quick poll asking participants if they have experienced or witnessed any anti-Asian American harassment as of late. In that recent April session, 42% said they’d seen or experienced verbal harassment ― slurs or being told to “go back to your country.” Sixty-two percent of people said they’d personally heard someone say “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” the racist shorthand for COVID-19 favored by former President Donald Trump. In the sessions, Catherine Shieh and her co-trainers discuss how events in the news shape public opinion about Asian Americans. Hollaback! Then, the instructors delve into real-world scenarios and go over the “5 Ds of bystander training.” The five ways they talk about intervening when you witness harassment or physical violence in public are: distract (by asking for directions, for instance); delegate (ask for help); delay (check in on the harassed person after the incident is over); direct (speak out directly to the attacker) and document (video or audio record). The “5 Ds” are important, but mostly, Shieh tries to impress on attendees that doing something ― almost anything ― is better than doing nothing. (That kind of inaction was on full display in April, when two security guards at a hotel near New York City’s Times Square watched and did nothing to help a 65-year-old Asian woman who was being beaten in broad daylight by a man because of her race.) The trainings offer actionable advice for real-world scenarios “In most moments, you don’t always have to be direct in your interventions or interaction. Get creative: Make a loud sound or drive your car up to where the incident is happening,” Shieh said. “You don’t necessarily have to [be] direct [with] the person who is doing the harassing.” Karen Eng, the CEO of an engineering firm in Chicago, attended a training in February. She’s read about the attacks against Asian Americans and also has a cousin who was racially profiled early in the pandemic. (While waiting to board a plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Eng’s cousin, who is Asian American, was asked to move farther away by three men who said they were concerned about getting the coronavirus from her.) What Eng most appreciated about the bystander training was that it gave people options as to how to respond in these high-tension situations. “There’s not one answer for the solution; you can act based on the circumstance or how you feel,” she said. “But you have choices. The more you are presented with them, the easier it will be to handle.” People march to protest against anti-Asian hate crimes on Brooklyn Bridge in New York on April 4, 2021. Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images Eventually, Shieh and her team hope to expand the program so it’s taught in different languages. They also want to offer more age-appropriate workshops for kids. (One poll in September found that 1 in 4 Asian American youths have experienced racist bullying since the coronavirus pandemic began.) And given that so many of these attacks are against older Asians, she’d also like to get more seniors in attendance. Jorge Arteaga, the deputy director of Hollaback!, told HuffPost he admires the way Shieh has pushed to make the trainings more accessible and relevant to different audiences and communities. “Cat is insightful and thoughtful with this,” he said. “She’s able to be vulnerable and uses her own experiences in order to invite others to connect to the work. Her dedication and commitment to the work and the community are instrumental in the anti-hate work she’s doing.” Now that people are more aware of anti-Asian hate, Shieh hopes they won’t stop learning about the history and long-standing issues existing in the AAPI community: gentrification, voting rights, housing, unemployment. “I obviously want everyone to take a bystander intervention training, but I don’t want that to flatten the Asian American experience,” she said. “We are more than just an issue. There’s a string of other issues that we’re all fighting for ― other systemic racial injustices. I think this is only the start of a longer fight.” More APAHM Stories Asian Americans Out Loud How Welcome To Chinatown Is Preserving The Vibrancy Of Asian-Owned Small Businesses Alice Wong Wants To Make Space For More Disabled Asian Americans Like Her"

Asian Americans Out Loud is a project highlighting Asian Americans who are leading the way forward in art and activism. You can read more by visiting our APAHM  2021 homepage. Story By Sarah Ruiz-Grossman Photo of Vivian Huang By Kristen Murakoshi Amid a rise in anti-Asian racism, activists in California’s Bay Area are fighting for a future in which Asian and other communities of color feel safe — from hate crimes, but also from climate change, the housing crisis and more. “Think about safety in a more grounded, expansive way,” said Vivian Huang, deputy director of the Oakland-based Asian Pacific Environmental Network, “about people feeling connected to one another, having access to resources they need, the stability that comes from stable housing, food and health care access.” For Huang and other activists, the violence this past year against Asians — including high-profile attacks on older people in the Bay Area — did not happen in a vacuum: It’s part of a long history of anti-Asian racism in this country. The solutions are complex and require long-term planning, including organizing with other people of color and demanding investments in their communities’ livelihoods and health. People honor the victims of the Atlanta mass shootings at a vigil in Oakland, California, in March. Joyce Xi/APEN In Oakland and nearby Richmond — which are disproportionately Black, Latinx, Asian and poor — APEN has been organizing for nearly three decades with Laotian refugees and Chinese immigrants around issues endangering all residents of color. The organization has been fighting against toxic pollution in Richmond, organizing to keep Chevron from expanding its oil refinery, and successfully pushing to pass a local ordinance to phase out the local export of fossil fuels. While battling the housing crisis in Oakland, the group has fought for increased renter protections, negotiated with major developers to build more affordable housing, and organized a mutual aid fund for families struggling during the pandemic. AYPAL, an Asian and Pacific Islander youth group, has also been in Oakland since the 1990s, organizing students to fight gentrification and give voice to Asian American and Pacific Islander students in the local school district. In recent years, the group has joined others in protesting the Oakland A’s baseball team’s attempt to build a stadium that the community feared would push out lower-income residents, and passed a resolution in Oakland schools to disaggregate students’ racial and ethnic data in order to reflect how Southeast Asian students are disproportionately impacted by poverty. When it came to responding to the recent spike in anti-Asian violence, the organizations set up rallies alongside groups led by Black, Indigenous and other people of color and called for solutions that would keep everyone safe. Notably, the groups pushed to not give more resources and funding to law enforcement, due to the harm overpolicing can cause to Black and Latinx neighbors, as well as Southeast Asians. “We all deserve safety. We’re not safe if only one part of our community is safe,” Huang said, adding that the multiracial groups have a common cause: “combating white supremacy.” People rally at a February demonstration in response to anti-Asian violence in the Bay Area. Photo by Denny Khamphanthong Since last year, Asian Americans have reported a surge in racist violence, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders rose by 150% in major U.S. cities, per one study. And Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, recorded an alarming 3,795 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans from early 2020 to early 2021, with over 1,600 incidents in California alone. People were called racial slurs, spat on and assaulted. In the Bay Area specifically, there has been a spike in violent attacks on older Asians: In January, a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground in Oakland’s Chinatown and an 84-year-old Thai man was shoved and killed in San Francisco. In March, 59-year-old Danny Yu Chang was violently beaten on Market Street in downtown San Francisco. Then, on March 16, the entire nation reeled after a white man went to three massage spas in the Atlanta area and shot and killed eight people, including six Asian women. Days later, APEN held a vigil in Oakland organized by a coalition of multiracial groups, which hundreds of people attended. People left flowers, lit candles, danced and cried. At the end, APEN Organizing Director Alvina Wong, who is Asian, and Oakland City Councilmember Carroll Fife, who is Black, lit a paper lantern together inscribed with the words: “May we live without fear.” APEN Organizing Director Alvina Wong and Oakland City Councilmember Carroll Fife light a lantern at a vigil for victims of the Atlanta mass shootings. Joyce Xi/APEN The concerns and fates of Asian activists in the Bay are indelibly intertwined with other communities of color. Last summer, as the nation took to the streets in support of Black Lives Matter and against police violence, APEN’s members protested as well, calling for their Asian siblings to join them. AYPAL’s co-director Stanley Pun noted that the group’s Asian students “grew up in low-income neighborhoods where they were hyper-policed in similar ways to Black and brown folks in Oakland, so there’s similar distrust in investment in police as the solution.” Joining calls for less investment in police in the wake of violent attacks on older Asians can be a controversial position within the Asian community, Pun noted, saying the group is “not a monolith.” “There are humans in this movement who are against Asian hate but pro-police, so it’s a weird line we’re trying to navigate,” he said. But he insisted that the group’s vision is around “making sure communities of color are learning and understanding about each other, investing in getting people gainful employment, investments in housing and mental health resources.” Stanley Pun poses at the AYPAL office in front of a mural created by some of the group's youth and signs from campaigns they’ve organized. Kristen Murakoshi for HuffPost “A lot of cases we’ve seen of violent acts were perpetrated by people needing mental health support — so how do we invest in those safety nets to be preventative, not reactionary?” Pun said. “How do we invest in things that would prevent them from happening in the first place?” Huang echoed that there is “a lot of complexity” around the issues activists work on, especially as they work both within Asian communities and across multiracial spaces. But she believes the work is “better because of this complexity.” “Our ability to hold many truths at the same time is critically important to advancing the way forward,” she said. In California, where there have been worsening wildfires and increasingly unaffordable housing for years, the work of APEN, AYPAL and other activists will go on long after the public’s attention has waned. They just hope people are paying attention to what they really want. “The safety we’re looking for demands long-term investments in the needs that people have ... housing, health care, living-wage employment,” Huang said. The young people Pun works with “want more investment in education and employment and housing,” he said. “But I don’t know who will listen to them.” More APAHM Stories She Was Attacked And No One Intervened.

12,Biden Announces New Refugee Cap 1 Month After Backlash,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration is set to formally raise its cap on refugee admissions to 62,500 for the fiscal year, the White House announced on Monday after facing blowback last month for initially announcing it would keep limits set by former President Donald Trump. “Today, I am revising the United States’ annual refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for this fiscal year,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “This erases the historically low number set by the previous administration of 15,000, which did not reflect America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees. The new admissions cap will also reinforce efforts that are already underway to expand the United States’ capacity to admit refugees, so that we can reach the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions that I intend to set for the coming fiscal year.” The administration also added that, though it was not likely to reach 62,500 admissions this year ― which ends Sept. 30 — it aimed “to use every tool available to help these fully-vetted refugees fleeing horrific conditions in their home countries. This will reassert American leadership and American values when it comes to refugee admissions.” Last month, the administration initially said it would keep Trump’s record-low refugee target at just 15,000 for the remainder of this fiscal year despite pledging to increase that number on the campaign trail. Immigration advocates and top Democrats slammed that decision as “incoherent” and “cruel.” Mere hours later, the White House walked back that initial number, and said it would announce the new cap in the upcoming weeks. “The challenge of ramping up admissions to this level is daunting, but America has risen to the occasion before, and given the global need, we must do it again,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement. Not only is there federal support for this lifesaving work, there is also strong community support across the country and across the political spectrum.” “Generations of Americans have opened their doors and their hearts to refugees, and their presence has made rural towns and urban centers safer, more vibrant, and economically stronger communities,” she added. According to the presidential determination, 22,000 slots for the 2021 fiscal year will be allocated to refugees from Africa, 6,000 slots for East Asia, 13,000 slots for Near East and South Asia, 4,000 slots for Europe and Central Asia, and an additional 5,000 slots for Latin America and the Caribbean. An additional 12,500 slots are available in a reserve to be used as needed. While running for president and after he was sworn in, Biden repeatedly promised to raise the refugee cap, which Trump decimated. But nearly a month after announcing its plans, the administration delayed signing the formal refugee cap. Without his signature, hundreds of refugee flights were canceled, refugees from several Muslim majority countries were excluded and refugee agencies across the globe were left in the dark. For months, refugee agencies called on Biden for answers to no avail. People close to the White House speculated that the administration delayed signing the directive due to concerns of political optics as the administration struggled to care for the surge of migrants and unaccompanied children at the border. The White House also initially said that federal agencies were overwhelmed by the border surges ― a reasoning that was sharply criticized by refugee resettlement organizations and activists. Migrants at the border seeking asylum are processed separately from refugees fleeing war and persecution overseas. “We are relieved that the Biden administration has, after a long and unnecessary delay, kept its promise to raise the refugee admissions cap for this year to 62,500,” said Lauren Hartnett, humanitarian media lead at Oxfam America, in a statement. “This announcement means the United States can finally begin to rebuild the life-saving refugee resettlement program and welcome the tens of thousands of people who have been left stranded by four years of the Trump administration’s xenophobic policies and three months of the Biden administration’s inaction.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,U.S. Begins Reuniting Some Families Separated At Mexico Border,social-justice," SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration said Monday that four families that were separated at the Mexico border during Donald Trump’s presidency will be reunited in the United States this week in what Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calls “just the beginning” of a broader effort. Two of the four families include mothers who were separated from their children in late 2017, one Honduran and another Mexican, Mayorkas said, declining to detail their identities. He described them as children who were 3 years old at the time and “teenagers who have had to live without their parent during their most formative years.” Parents will return to the United States on humanitarian parole while authorities consider other longer-term forms of legal status, said Michelle Brane, executive director of the administration’s Family Reunification Task Force. The children are already in the U.S. Exactly how many families will reunite in the United States and in what order is linked to negotiations with the American Civil Liberties Union to settle a federal lawsuit in San Diego, but Mayorkas said there were more to come. “We continue to work tirelessly to reunite many more children with their parents in the weeks and months ahead,” Mayorkas told reporters. “We have a lot of work still to do, but I am proud of the progress we have made and the reunifications that we have helped to achieve.” More than 5,500 children were separated from their parents during the Trump administration going back to July 1, 2017, many of them under a “zero-tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute any adult who entered the country illegally, according to court filings. The Biden administration is doing its own count going back to Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 and, according to Brane, believes more than 1,000 families remain separated. While family separation under “zero-tolerance” ended in June 2018 under court order and shortly after Trump reversed course, Biden has repeatedly assailed the practice as an act of cruelty. An executive order on his first day in office pledged to reunite families that were still separated “to the greatest extent possible.” The ACLU is happy for the four families but their reunifications are “just the tip of the iceberg,” said attorney Lee Gelernt. Among the more than 5,500 children known to have been separated, more than 1,000 may still be apart from their parents and more than 400 parents have yet to be located, he said. “We need the Biden administration to provide relief to all of them, including providing them a permanent pathway to citizenship and care,” Gelernt said. The reunifications begin as the Biden administration confronts the third major increase in unaccompanied children arriving at the border in seven years. It has made major strides moving children from grossly overcrowded Border Patrol facilities to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shelters, which are more suited to longer-term stays until children are placed with sponsors in the United States, typically parents or close relatives. The average stay for an unaccompanied child in Border Patrol custody has plummeted to about 20 hours, below the legal limit of 72 hours and down from 133 hours in late March, Mayorkas said. There are 677 unaccompanied children in Border Patrol custody, down from more than 5,700 in late March. Health and Human Services opened 14 emergency intake centers, raising capacity to nearly 20,000 beds from 952 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency was dispatched March 13, Mayorkas said. About 400 asylum officers from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have been assigned as case managers to speed the release of children to sponsors. As of Thursday, Health and Human Services had 22,557 children in its care. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,How Arizona's Attorney General Is Weaponizing Climate Fears To Keep Out Immigrants,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost When Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich accused the Biden administration of failing to protect the environment in a recent lawsuit, it seemed like an unusual claim from a Republican better known for distorting climate science in legal briefs defending oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. That is, until you read what Brnovich considers the source of pollution: immigrants. In a lawsuit filed April 12, Brnovich seeks to reinstate President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, on the argument that Biden has failed to carry out mandatory environmental reviews on how more immigration could increase climate-changing pollution. “Migrants (like everyone else) need housing, infrastructure, hospitals, and schools. They drive cars, purchase goods, and use public parks and other facilities,” the suit reads. “Their actions also directly result in the release of pollutants, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which directly affects air quality.” Using pro-environment arguments to defend anti-immigration views dates back decades, to a time when the environmental movement harbored a powerful faction of Malthusians who believed the preservation of nature merited harsh, even violent, restrictions on immigration and childbearing. That faction faded to the fringes over the years as the political right moved to championing both climate denial and hardened borders, and environmentalists marginalized any openly racist elements in their camp. Now, Arizona’s lawsuit is one of the highest-profile examples of how the political right will shift on climate change as warming-fueled disasters mount and render denial an untenable position. “As it becomes more and more difficult to deny that climate change is real and human caused, the Republican Party is going to need new strategies, especially if they have any hope of attracting a younger generation,” said John Hultgren, a professor of environmental politics at Bennington College in Vermont. “This is a potential strategy. It won’t do anything to help us mitigate or adapt to climate change, but it will give the thin veneer of an appearance that they care about climate change.” It is also a sign that a more nefarious ideological view could be making its way into mainstream politics: the idea that the response to ecological collapse and rising seas should be to limit who gets a seat in a finite number of civilizational lifeboats. That view has already gained traction in Europe, where far-right parties are increasingly adopting that rhetoric as voters’ concern over climate change converges with anger at migrants. After green parties picked up votes in the 2019 European parliamentary elections, French far-right leader Marine Le Pen pledged to remake Europe as “the world’s first ecological civilization” and railed against “nomadic” people who “do not care about the environment” as “they have no homeland,” harkening to the Nazis’ “blood and soil” slogan that described a belief in a mystical connection between race and a particular territory. Le Pen is now a frontrunner in France’s 2022 presidential election. In Germany, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party’s Berlin youth wing urged its leaders to abandon climate denialism. The green arm of Italy’s neo-fascist movement CasaPound, meanwhile, sent trees to towns across the country to pay homage to former dictator Benito Mussolini. In the English-speaking world, far-right eco-fascist thinking animated the manifestos two mass shooters posted in 2019. The white male gunman who killed nearly two dozen people in a Walmart store in El Paso in August 2019 said he sought to end the “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” “The environment is getting worse by the year,” the manifesto, posted online, stated. “Most of y’all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle. So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.” The document explicitly cited the 74-page message the gunman who killed 51 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, posted in March 2019. That shooter, a 28-year-old white Australian, thrice described himself as an “eco-fascist” motivated to repel waves of migrants fleeing climate change-ravaged regions of the world from Anglophone nations’ shores. “It is shocking to see what was in the El Paso shooter’s manifesto described in more legalistic language in this suit by the Arizona attorney general,” said Alexandra Stern, a historian at the University of Michigan. “It’s leaning in toward ecofascism.” But Hultgren expressed wariness about labeling the Arizona lawsuit as “ecofascism,” which he said conjures images of a foreign enemy in Nazi Germany. It also obscures what he called the rich history of American “right-wingers instrumentally appropriating nature to advance xenophobic goals.” “When we call things ‘fascist,’ there’s a sense that it’s outside the American political norm,” he said. “In reality, these arguments have long existed.” The most vocal proponents of using environmental concerns to oppose immigrants have been the so-called Tanton Network, a collection of more than a dozen anti-immigration groups founded or funded by John Tanton, a rich opthamologist from Michigan. A one-time national leader in the Sierra Club, Tanton, who died in July 2019, “believed that the root cause of environmental destruction is overpopulation by the wrong sorts of people” and that “to protect both nature and the nation, one must preserve white supremacy by keeping immigrants out,” Betsy Hartmann, a researcher who studies ecofascism at Hampshire College, wrote last year in the Columbia Journalism Review. “When we call things ‘fascist,’ there’s a sense that it’s outside the American political norm. In reality, these arguments have long existed.” “It’s a Tanton Network strategy,” Hartmann said of the Arizona lawsuit. “This is a blatant first act on the national stage of this legal strategy.” Indeed, the Center for Immigration Studies, which Tanton founded in 1985, trumpeted the lawsuit as “an important stand for the American environment.” “Arizona is the first state to sue, but we can hope that it will not be the last,” wrote Julie Axelrod, the group’s litigation director and a former adviser to the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency. “The environmental consequences of immigration have never been more apparent.” Axelrod pioneered the strategy with a 2016 lawsuit against the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security, which she accused of violating “our nation’s preeminent environmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by completely failing to perform environmental analysis of its legal immigration and amnesty policies, which have directly led to the entrance and permanent settlement of tens of millions of foreign nationals to the United States.” A federal judge dismissed most of the claims in 2018. The effects of climate change, meanwhile, are already plaguing Central America, where many migrants to the U.S.’s southern border originate. Two of last year’s named 30 Atlantic hurricanes made landfall over the region, wreaking havoc with devastating floods and winds in what scientists said was a sign of a warmer future. Historic droughts parched hillsides in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, incentivizing rural villagers to make the dangerous trek north to the regional superpower and world’s largest economy. Between 1.4 million and 2.1 million people in Central America and Mexico are likely to be displaced from their homes by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, according to a 2018 World Bank report. The United States produced nearly 30% of the carbon dioxide emissions currently accumulated in the atmosphere, by far the largest share. Today, the U.S. is the second-largest emitter of planet-heating gas after China and has the fourth-highest per capita emissions rate. But research does not support the idea that immigrants increase pollution. In a 2011 study published in the journal Population Research and Policy Review, scientists analyzed federal pollution data in 183 different metropolitan areas and determined “that immigration does not contribute to local air pollution levels across any of the seven pollution measures examined.” A 2019 study in the Social Science Journal compared air quality data in counties populated by immigrants and native-born citizens in a series of models and found “that native population is strongly associated with worse air quality, while foreign-born population is associated with better air quality.” Taking that a step further, a January 2021 study in the journal Population and Environment looked at state-level data from 1997 to 2014 and concluded that “immigration may indeed yield environmental benefits and that environmental quality may represent an important factor or amenity influencing immigration flows.” A Center for Immigration Studies spokeswoman declined an interview request for Axelrod. In an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Brnovich, whose office did not make him available for an interview, said he was simply opting to use the same flexibly interpreted law “the left always uses to stop highway projects and airport reconstruction.” “We are saying that by stopping the wall construction, they’re violating NEPA because it’s allowing more and more people to come into this country ― migrants ― and that’s having a devastating impact on our environment,” Brnovich said. “It’s also impacting the increased population, which will have all sorts of impacts down the road.” The political opportunism shows how “the outer bounds of NEPA are quite undefined,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Environmentalists have been trying to push it outward for half a century,” Gerrard said. “So it’s not surprising to see the right attempt to push it as well.” Stern said the future of this kind of rhetoric within the Republican Party could depend on whether the Arizona lawsuit proves successful in federal court. “It’s not clear where this is going,” she said. “But ultimately rhetoric that identifies certain groups of people as pollutants is dehumanizing, and dehumanization is a key component and often the first step toward greater violence toward those groups.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,3 Men Indicted On Federal Hate Crime Charges In Death Of Ahmaud Arbery,social-justice," Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost A federal grand jury in Georgia indicted three men Wednesday in connection with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was shot while jogging in Georgia last year. Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan each face a hate crime charge and a charge of attempted kidnapping. These are separate from state charges brought against the three men last year over the February 2020 killing. The federal grand jury alleged that Travis McMichael, 35, and his father, Gregory McMichael, 65, “did willfully, by force and threat of force, injure, intimidate, and interfere with Ahmaud Arbery, an African American man, because of Arbery’s race and color” while Arbery was “running on a public street in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Brunswick, Georgia.” The indictment charges that the McMichaels “armed themselves with firearms, got into a truck, and chased Arbery through the public streets of the neighborhood while yelling at Arbery, using their truck to cut off his route, and threatening him with firearms.” They “attempted to forcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will” and their actions resulted “in the death of Ahmaud Arbery,” the indictment states. It also alleges that Bryan, 51, aided and abetted the McMichaels and that he “chased Arbery through the public streets of the neighborhood, and used his truck to cut off Arbery’s route.” The indictment came as the Biden administration steps up civil rights enforcement at the Justice Department. The federal hate crimes investigation became public last May. Read the indictment below. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

0,GOP Politicians Won’t Delete Tweets About Debunked Kamala Harris Story,social-justice," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost A number of Republican lawmakers have refused to remove their tweets promoting a discredited news story about Vice President Kamala Harris, even after the reporter who wrote the piece said it was made up. The controversy centers on an article the New York Post published on its front page Saturday, claiming that migrant children at a facility in Long Beach, California, were receiving “welcome kits” containing copies of Harris’ 2019 book “Superheroes Are Everywhere.” The story was quickly picked up by the right-wing echo chamber, which eagerly claimed that Harris was profiting off of unaccompanied minors at the southern border. “The Biden administration’s weakness caused a surge of illegal immigration,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “Now they’re forcing taxpayers to buy Kamala Harris’s book to give to those illegal immigrants?” The story was a fabrication, as Laura Italiano, the New York Post reporter who wrote the story, admitted in a statement revealing that she had resigned from the paper because of it. “An announcement: Today I handed in my resignation to my editors at the New York Post,” she tweeted on Tuesday. “The Kamala Harris story ― an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against ― was my breaking point.” The story now has an editor’s note reading, “The original version of this article said migrant kids were getting Harris’ book in a welcome kit, but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child.” It’s not even clear that a single copy of the book was “given to a child.” As The Washington Post noted, one copy of Harris’ book “was photographed by Reuters on a vacant bed at a shelter in Long Beach last week. It was one of many items, including toys and clothing, donated by residents in a citywide drive, Long Beach officials said. No government funds were used to purchase the items, according to a city spokeswoman.” Republicans have been hammering the Biden administration on immigration and the situation at the border, seeing it as a potential political vulnerability. Harris has been a target ever since Biden put her in charge of addressing the long-term issues in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that are leading to the migration to the United States. Despite the admission that the original story was false, Republican lawmakers ― as well as the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee ― have largely kept up their tweets promoting the fake controversy. But after HuffPost inquired about the tweets, two GOP House members ― Reps. Debbie Lesko (Ariz.) and Ken Buck (Colo.) did delete the tweets. None of the lawmakers returned a request for comment. Below are the tweets that are still up. The Biden administration's weakness caused a surge of illegal immigration.

1,FBI Investigating Vandalism On Fargo-Area Mosque,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The FBI is investigating hate messages found vandalized on a mosque that sits on the border of North Dakota and Minnesota. Police in Moorhead, Minnesota, were dispatched to the Moorhead Fargo Islamic Center Mosque early Sunday in response to reports of vandalism. Officers found anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, and racist messages spray-painted on several areas outside the buildings. The incident happened during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Muslim civil rights organization Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said that officials with the mosque told its Minnesota chapter that vandals spray-painted hate messages such as “Death to Islam,” “Fuck Islam,” “Go to hell,” the N-word and a Nazi swastika on or near the institution, which also had a broken window. Police released photos on Sunday from the mosque’s building surveillance, showing a suspect wearing a camouflage jacket and dark ski mask. The surveillance shows the suspect at night, implying that the vandalism occurred Saturday night. UPDATE: Moorhead Police are searching for this man in connection to last night’s hate-crime graffiti. If you have any information, call 701-451-7600 immediately. Both MPD & the FBI are investigating. https://t.co/GJrhOQqevX pic.twitter.com/38hBm4JGWM Moorhead police are actively investigating the incident with assistance from the FBI’s Fargo office. Officials from both cities released a statement saying that they are sharing “overwhelming support” for the Muslim congregation, according to The Associated Press. “Hate will not have a home in Moorhead,” Mayor Shelly Carlson said in the statement. “The words and symbols defacing the Islamic Center are horrifying to view, but we must view them to bear witness and understand the magnitude and depth of how these hate-filled words impact those in our community.” CAIR-Minnesota Executive Director Jaylani Hussein called on local, state and federal authorities Sunday to investigate the incident as a hate crime, “and to devote all resources necessary to bring the perpetrators to justice.” ""We call on the FBI, law enforcement & elected officials to condemn & investigate this latest hate crime attack targeting the Muslim community in the Moorhead area during the holy month of Ramadan."" -Jaylani HusseinDonate to the mosque security fund: https://t.co/ZNm4kRek2F pic.twitter.com/tXVxvZvaJL “Our state’s lawmakers must also show that they take growing hate crimes seriously by passing legislation to update how hate incidents are reported and handled,” Hussein said. A Minnesota House committee has moved forward a bill that would update the state’s hate crime statutes to allow community organizations to report hate crimes to the Department of Human Rights, reform police training to respond to hate crimes and treat graffiti containing hateful messages as a hate crime. The U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations sent a letter to President Joe Biden calling on him to appoint a special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Muslim hate. The White House did not respond as to whether it would make such a decision, according to USA Today. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,$5 Do-It-Yourself Ladders Thwarting Trump's $16 Billion Border Wall,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A busy section of Donald Trump’s southern border wall — which cost an astonishing $27 million a mile to build — is being foiled by inexpensive ladders, Texas Monthly reported this week. “Ladders and walls go together like peas and carrots,” explained one McAllen Border Patrol agent. The typical wall-thwarting strategy along a stretch of the border in the Rio Grande Valley between Granjeno and Hidalgo, Texas, is wooden and about a dozen feet high with only six or so rungs. “It’s made of cheap, rough wood, quickly nailed together because it is only going to be used once,” local artist and activist Scott Nicol told Texas Monthly. “Unlike the wall, these ladders are functional.” He estimates the materials for the most primitive wooden ladders cost about $5. Some are higher and have more rungs, while ladders up river may be rope-and-PVC or rusted rebar ladders that hook to the top of the barrier. “Camouflage” rebar ladders blend in with the bollards of the barriers and are often left in place for repeated use, the El Paso Times reported last year. The materials for those ladders also cost about $5. Nicol has photos of several dozen versions of ladders. They “show how absurd the idea is that a wall is going to stop anybody,” he said. The artist has walked the border for years, searching out the ladders and anything else travelers leave behind. He spotted six discarded ladders during part of just one day with a reporter, and has spotted far more than usual in the last couple of months as the numbers of people secretly crossing the border soar. Border Patrol caught more than 171,000 migrants along the southern border in March, the highest one-month total in 15 years. In yet another breach of the wall, some migrants are using an inexpensive power tool to saw out sections along the bottom to crawl through before replacing it . While agents admit the wall isn’t a total deterrent, it does stop many, and clearly would make travel by families and especially children more difficult. Recent terrifying videos show children being dropped from atop the barriers into U.S. territory. The wall also slows progress, giving agents time to nab people attempting to enter the country, according to agents. Lately, though, they don’t have enough time to both process people at the border and apprehend those scaling the barrier. “We have people turning themselves over, and at the same time, when it’s dark we have people with ladders, but we got nobody to go over because we’re tied up,” Chris Cabrera, a McAllen-based Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council union, told Texas Monthly. Despite the massive $16 billion cost of Trump’s wall, using funds from Congress and diverting money from the Pentagon, the administration only managed to complete some 80 miles of new barrier, The Hill noted. An additional 400 miles of existing barriers were reinforced. During his 2016 presidential campaign Trump promised to build 1,000 miles of border wall, which he vowed Mexico would pay for.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Nearly 500 Asylum-Seekers Have Been Attacked As Biden Keeps Turning Them Away,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Asylum-seekers turned away at the United States’ southern border over the last four months have reported nearly 500 cases of attacks or kidnappings in Mexico, according to a new joint report from three human rights and immigration organizations. Human Rights First, Al Otro Lado and Haitian Bridge Alliance documented 492 reports of violent attacks since Biden took office, including rape, kidnapping and assault. In each case, the victim was someone who had been turned away at the border under Title 42, a law invoked by the Trump administration that allows border officials to send people back under the pretense of pandemic safety. Many of those turned away remain in Mexico, even if it is not their home country, either in hopes of getting another chance or because they have run out of resources to go elsewhere. The Biden administration has been criticized for continuing the use of Title 42. Since March 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has expelled more than 642,700 people under the order, including over 100,000 people in March 2021 alone. Although Biden promised his administration would not use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors and has allowed some asylum-seekers into the U.S. for their court hearings, immigration advocates say continued use of Title 42 is inhumane and ineffective, in large part because asylum-seekers face such dangerous and desperate situations after they are turned away. “What I have before me is our clients being assaulted, being kidnapped, being sex trafficked, being tortured, being raped,” said Nicole Ramos, director of Al Otro Lado’s Border Rights Project, “and what I see before me with Title 42 not being repealed is the Biden administration doing nothing to prevent that.” In Mexico, asylum-seekers face danger from criminal gang members who in many reported cases have kidnapped or threatened to kidnap them for ransom. Many live in poverty and lack access to essential services, food and water because they are in limbo, hoping to cross. Earlier this month, a 10-year-old Nicaraguan boy and his mother were kidnapped just hours after they were refused entry and sent to Mexico under Title 42. Another woman from El Salvador was reportedly kidnapped and raped in front of her 3-year-old son after she was also expelled under the same policy. “Despite his frequent pledges to reverse President Trump’s cruelty at the border, President Biden is continuing a policy that is wreaking havoc: it endangers children, drives family separations, and illegally returns asylum seekers to danger, including Black and LGBTQ refugees forced to endure bias-motivated violence in Mexico,” the report said. Those targeted asylum-seekers documented in Tuesday’s report came from over 17 nations including Haiti, Cameroon, Guatemala, Russia, Somalia, Venezuela and Yemen, according to the report, which was based on more than 110 in-person interviews, an electronic survey of more than 1,200 asylum-seekers, data from the Mexican and U.S. governments, and other media and human rights reports. Black asylum seekers were disproportionately affected. Despite the administration’s rollback of the 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” which forced individuals to return to Mexico as they awaited court hearings, the report noted that Black refugees from Africa and the Caribbean remained stranded in Mexico. At least 61% of Haitian asylum-seekers who were trapped in Mexico were victims of crime there. Muhamed, an asylum-seeker from East Africa who arrived in Mexico in February 2020, told reporters in a press call about the report about the mistreatment he faced while waiting to cross into the U.S. Muhamed, who did not use his full name since his asylum case is still under consideration, said he was extorted into paying hundreds of pesos to police for protection and struggled to pay rent and purchase food for his family. “As a Black person, life was very hard,” he said. Muhamed said he was among the lucky ones; he was eventually granted entry into the U.S. None of the more than 150 asylum-seekers Human Rights First interviewed in March and April 2021 said that U.S. immigration officers had referred them to apply for asylum or granted them a protection screening before they were expelled to Mexico. “I am speaking in the name of all those people. For those children. For those Black migrants who look like me and their skin color is criminalized,” he said. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Senate Passes Bill Seeking To Address Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The Senate on Thursday passed a bill to address the rise in hate incidents and violence against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic ― a rare show of bipartisanship on an issue that gained fresh urgency after a series of shootings at Atlanta-area spas last month. The legislation, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), would expedite a federal review of coronavirus-related hate crimes, expand data collection and public reporting of such incidents, and provide guidance on best practices to mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID-19 pandemic. It passed 94-1 after Hirono accepted proposed changes from Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The bill would also provide funding to train law enforcement on investigating hate incidents, create a hate crimes hotline, and establish programs to rehabilitate perpetrators — all proposed in an amendment by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas). Hirono, the first Asian American woman elected to the Senate, blamed former President Donald Trump for fueling the rise in hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by repeatedly referring to the COVID-19 virus as a “China virus” and the “kung flu.” Hirono said she could relate to other Americans fearing for their safety amid the uptick in hate crimes. “Before, if I was walking around outside, I would have my earbuds on, listening to books on tape ... I would never do that now,” Hirono told reporters earlier this month. There was initially some uncertainty about Republican support for the bill. Several GOP senators expressed concerns about its definition of hate crimes being “too broad,” saying that it could result in unintended consequences during court sentencing. Others believed the measure mandated too much federal data collection on private citizens. Progressives were watching closely to see whether Hirono’s legislation would become the first to fall to the filibuster under the new Democratic-controlled Senate. If Republicans did block it, advocates of eliminating the chamber’s long-standing two-thirds vote requirement on legislation would have gained even more ammo to go nuclear and eliminate the filibuster. That consideration may have also crossed the minds of some GOP senators. But to filibuster opponents, one bill that passes with bipartisan support doesn’t discount the urgency to eliminate the filibuster given fierce GOP opposition to many other top Democratic priorities such as voting rights, climate change, gun control and immigration. “The fundamental reality remains the same: that unless Democrats eliminate the filibuster, they have no chance of passing some of their top priorities,” said Eli Zupnick, a spokesperson for Fix Our Senate, a group dedicated to ending the Senate filibuster. “It’s great that Sen. McConnell is allowing some bills to get done, but nobody should be under any illusions that this means the Senate is working well.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Rep. Val Demings Goes Off On Jim Jordan In Fiery Shouting Match About Policing,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) blew up at Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday when her colleague interrupted her as she was discussing law enforcement. The committee was discussing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, legislation that seeks to address the surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. Demings was criticizing an amendment introduced by Republicans that would prevent the defunding of police departments, even though the legislation does not have any provision to strip funds from law enforcement. Demings, a former police officer, said the amendment was “completely irrelevant.” “I served as a law enforcement officer for 27 years,” she said. “It is a tough job, and good police officers deserve your support. You know, it’s interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it is politically convenient to do so. Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day. They deserve better.” It's interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it's politically convenient to do so, but not when police officers who protect us every day here at the Capitol were fighting for their lives because of the Big Lie. @HouseJudiciary pic.twitter.com/x9i9LO5AAi At this point, Jordan tried to interject, earning a fierce rebuke from Demings, who shouted, “I have the floor, Mr. Jordan!” “What, did I strike a nerve?” she added. “Law enforcement officers deserve better than to be utilized as pawns, and you and your colleagues should be ashamed of yourselves.” Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) tried to defuse the situation, but the two lawmakers continued to shout at one another. Jordan, a staunch ally of Donald Trump, persistently pushed the former president’s lie that he won the 2020 election even after it led to the Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol in which his supporters violently assaulted police officers. The exchange came as jurors deliberated over the verdict for white former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. He was later found guilty of the murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose death sparked nationwide protests calling for racial justice and police reform. “Defund the police” became one of the rallying cries of that movement. Its proponents seek to divert funding from police departments and instead boost areas, such as education, health care and social services, that can help prevent crime and intervene in situations better handled without law enforcement.

13,Kamala Harris Visits Historic Woolworth's Lunch Counter Where Sit-In Movement Began,social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost In a surprise stop during a visit to Greensboro, North Carolina, on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris dropped in on the International Civil Rights Center and Museum. The museum houses what remains of the Woolworth’s five-and-dime where, on Feb. 1, 1960, four Black college students sat at a lunch counter and politely asked for service ― a revolutionary act at the time. They were rebuffed, but they returned to the whites-only lunch counter day after day in increasing numbers, popularizing the sit-in movement that spread quickly across the South. Harris reportedly sat in the seat once occupied by Rosa Parks when she visited the museum in the 1990s.

14,"DeSantis Vaccine Slogan Is ‘Seniors First’ – But ‘Rich, White Seniors First’ Is What Happened",social-justice," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost BRADENTON, Fla. – Over and over and over, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has described his COVID-19 vaccination plan in just two words: “Seniors First” — yet the addition of two extra words at the beginning might have made it far more accurate: “Rich” and “White.” Because, while coronavirus vaccines are more broadly available in Florida today just as they are nationally, DeSantis’ earliest efforts, particularly his high-profile visits to the opening of “pop-up” vaccine clinics around the state, favored wealthier, whiter communities — which also happen to be his voting base. “I’m 71 years old, and I haven’t been able to get one,” said Willie Smith, a Black retired truck driver and Air Force veteran, during a visit to Little Buddy’s Neighborhood Store to pick up some lottery tickets. “I’ve been trying to go online, but I haven’t been able to get one. They’re always full.” Smith’s bad luck was to live in a poor part of Bradenton rather than a dozen miles east in Lakewood Ranch, a brand-new housing development where the median household income is $106,000 — nearly twice that of Manatee County as a whole and quadruple that of Smith’s neighborhood. DeSantis staged a photo opportunity at Lakewood Ranch’s Premier Sports Complex in February, bringing 3,000 doses with him, for the exclusive benefit of residents of the two zip codes that make up the development. Another “pop-up” clinic was set up at a golf course retirement community near Punta Gorda, in southwest Florida’s Charlotte County, that was built by a major donor. Still another was set up for The Villages, the famously Republican retirement community near Ocala. And a clinic was even arranged for 1,200 residents in Key Largo’s Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive enclave of multi-million dollar homes, many with their own docks with quick access to the Atlantic. According to reporting by the Miami Herald, the hospital providing the vaccine doses for that clinic had to cancel hundreds of appointments already made for other people, including those with underlying health problems. “It’s almost like if you’re not a contributor, you don’t exist. It’s like he can’t see you.” Even DeSantis’ efforts in January to partner exclusively with the Publix grocery store chain contributed to the racial and socioeconomic disparity in vaccinations. While the Florida-based company — which is also a major DeSantis donor — has more pharmacies than any other chain in the state, it has also purposefully targeted middle-class to wealthy neighborhoods in Florida over the decades, leaving poorer areas to competitors like Winn-Dixie and Food Lion. Other chains only began offering vaccines in February as part of the federal retail pharmacy program. “It’s actually as bad as it looks,” said Tracy Pratt, chair of the Manatee County Democrats. “We have a lot of vulnerable people who have been shut in, and they were angry that people who had access through a wealthy developer got theirs first.” DeSantis has scoffed at such critiques, typically with base-pleasing attacks on the news media. The governor and his office claim that wealth and race played no role in his vaccine rollout and point out that the first locations to get clinics were retirement communities in Democrat-rich Broward and Palm Beach counties. “It’s the age that matters,” DeSantis said at a news conference last month in Lehigh Acres in southwest Florida. “Black, white, rich, poor, Republicans, Democrats, that doesn’t matter. If you’re 65 and up, we want to get you the shot.” Actual statistics say otherwise. According to an exhaustive analysis of vaccine and demographic data by the USA Today Network of Florida newspapers, Floridians 65 and older in the richest third of the counties had been vaccinated at a rate 4 percentage points higher than the rest of the state. What’s more, the better access for the rich has resulted in just 6.4% of the state’s vaccines going to African Americans, although they account for 17% of the state’s population. And as the first-term Republican governor prepares for his 2022 reelection campaign and possibly a 2024 presidential run, the seemingly preferential treatment for his likeliest voters on a life-and-death matter is giving Democrats who hope to stop him a potent talking point. “It’s almost like if you’re not a contributor, you don’t exist. It’s like he can’t see you,” said Charlie Crist, Florida’s former Republican governor and current Democratic congressman from St. Petersburg. Crist is considering a second run as a Democrat for his old job, having come within 64,000 votes – one percentage point – of beating then-incumbent Republican Rick Scott in 2014. “It pains me to see what’s happening.” Nikki Fried, who in 2018 became the first Democrat to win a Cabinet office in the state since 2006, is also thought be considering a run for governor next year and has been calling DeSantis’ vaccine program a pay-to-play scheme. “If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” she said at a news conference in Tallahassee last month. The aspirations of Crist and Fried and Democrats generally notwithstanding, DeSantis starts out with an enormous advantage. He is the incumbent, and incumbent governors historically have been hard to beat in Florida. Over the past half-century, only one sitting governor has lost reelection: Republican Bob Martinez, who in 1990 was defeated by Lawton Chiles, a three-term U.S. senator and Florida legend making his political comeback after two years in retirement. Democrats Reubin Askew, Bob Graham and Chiles all won reelection, as did Republicans Jeb Bush and Rick Scott. Normal rules, though, may not apply to DeSantis, who won the 2018 GOP nomination almost entirely on the strength of his endorsement by then-President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is now 42, was a congressman from northeast Florida, little known in the state apart from his regular appearances on Fox News to defend Trump and attack Democrats. He handily defeated the scion of a cattle and citrus family, who was first elected to the Florida House in the 1990s when he was in his early 20s and was finishing his second term as agriculture commissioner in 2018. The Trump endorsement then became somewhat of an albatross during the general election, and DeSantis barely squeaked out a victory over Andrew Gillum, the state’s first African American major-party nominee who also happened to be caught up in an FBI corruption investigation. For the first year, DeSantis governed in the traditional Florida Republican mold of Jeb Bush or even Charlie Crist. He promised billions of dollars to restore the Everglades and posthumously pardoned four Black men wrongly convicted of rape in 1949 while pursuing generally pro-business policies. But, by the time of the pandemic, he was back firmly in the Trump camp, loudly and proudly aligning himself with the Fox News viewer base with regular attacks on epidemiologists, public health experts and what he calls the “corporate media.” He refused to issue a statewide mask mandate and even banned cities and counties last autumn from enforcing mandates they passed on their own. He insisted on reopening schools last fall, months before the arrival of a vaccine, and consistently sided with keeping the economy healthy over limiting the spread of the virus. Restaurants and bars — which experts consider a prime location for the spread of the coronavirus — closed only briefly, and were allowed to fully reopen to pre-pandemic levels in September. DeSantis’ choices affected not only Florida, but, because the state is a tourist destination, the rest of the country. Spring breakers packing into bars and nightclubs a year ago helped spread the virus to the other three corners of the nation. “His approach to the pandemic from a public health standpoint was completely irresponsible,” said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. “Voters will never forget that he didn’t take their anxiety seriously. He ridiculed them. And he didn’t need to. It was a misstep.” A year into the pandemic, DeSantis is continuing to push policies at odds with public health experts. He is suing the Centers for Disease Control to force the resumption of cruise ship sailings — even as he tries to forbid cruise lines and other private businesses from requiring proof of vaccinations from their customers. His most fraught pandemic-related decisions, though, may wind up being his process for distributing life-saving vaccines for a disease that has already killed 34,000 Floridians. When they became available in mid-December, DeSantis ignored public health officials’ advice to put front-line workers like police and firefighters in the second group to be inoculated immediately after nursing home residents and medical personnel. Instead, he ordered that the vaccines be made available to anyone 65 and over — even though most people in this category had the ability to remain at home, unlike first responders whose jobs require them to assist potentially coronavirus-positive members of the public. To DeSantis’ critics, even worse were his office’s decisions, often in consultation with private interests, that put politically connected communities at the head of the line. Harvey Goldstein, an 81-year-old retired constitutional law professor and a DeSantis supporter, lives in a housing tract immediately adjacent to King’s Gate in Charlotte County. He said he got himself on the list for the county’s vaccine slots and was waiting for his name to come up when he found out that his neighbors living in the golf course community developed by a DeSantis donor were getting a visit from DeSantis and a special vaccine clinic. “We thought that by just having it at King’s Gate, it was basically jumping the line for those people,” he said. “I just thought that particular issue could have been done better.” In response to HuffPost’s queries, DeSantis’ office sent out a lengthy list of the various clinics and other vaccine distribution arrangements it has used to target poor and medically underserved areas. It would not, however, say why those programs generally came weeks or months after a more robust effort aimed at whiter, wealthier retirement communities. Nor would it provide the criteria his administration used in scheduling the pop-up clinics around the state. Two longtime Florida Republican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said DeSantis does not intentionally favor wealthier white people as much as he suffers from a blind spot for Floridians who do not resemble typical Republican voters. One described how DeSantis had just recently helped Belle Glade, an impoverished sugarcane farming town beside Lake Okeechobee, get its own pop-up clinic after its dismal vaccination statistics were pointed out to him. That excuse, though, does not fly with Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican consultant who served as Gov. Martinez’s chief of staff in the late 1980s and then ran Jeb Bush’s 1994 campaign. “He was enabled by a combination of confusion and opacity, both of which I assume were intentional,” said Stipanovich, who in recent years has become a vocal critic of Trump and the Republicans who support him. “No one knew what was going on or when or where.” And Tammy Jackson-Moore, the community activist in Belle Glade who helped get the clinic there, said she would have hoped that data showing how hard COVID-19 was hitting Black and brown communities would have prompted DeSantis’ office to act without the need for lobbying. “Why did it take so long? We would have hoped that our community would have been treated like other communities,” she said, but added that she is grateful that DeSantis was, in the end, responsive. “We’re hopeful that we can build on that relationship.” With its recently cleared acres and sapling palms held upright with stakes and “villages” with names like “Harmony” and “Indigo,” Lakewood Ranch could be just about any upscale new housing development in Florida. In late February, though, the former pastureland and upland scrub suddenly became famous for the place where 3,000 well-to-do suburbanites in a politically connected development were suddenly pushed to the head of the coronavirus vaccine line. “We live in the infamous 34211,” said Deb Pierce, a 70-year-old retired college administrator. “It’s interesting to be living in one of those zip codes that keeps getting mentioned on the national news.” Text messages obtained under Florida’s expansive public records law show that the county commissioner for that district worked with the CEO of a major developer of Lakewood Ranch and DeSantis’ office to arrange a three-day clinic there and that they seemed fully aware of the political benefits for DeSantis. After the developer, Rex Jensen, wrote that DeSantis could get good “exposure” with a visit to Lakewood Ranch, county commissioner Vanessa Baugh wrote back: “Excellent point. After all, ’22 is right around the corner.” Bob Fine, a 72-year-old retired real estate lawyer and Pierce’s husband, said that the upper-middle-class white people of Lakewood Ranch were perfectly capable of navigating the system the county had created to schedule vaccine appointments. He said his neighbors would have multiple phones, tablets and laptops running to secure vaccine appointments, and not just in Manatee County. “People would have as much hardware as they could fit on the table,” he said. “People were driving all over the state.” Fine and Pierce said they were not at all comfortable getting a vaccine through the special Lakewood Wood ranch clinic, but in the end did not have to wrestle with that dilemma because they got appointments through the already established Manatee County sign-up system. He added that if extra doses were suddenly to have been had, they should have gone to poorer communities with fewer health care options. “They could have devoted them to parts of the county that were hit the hardest, either underserved by the vaccines, or by COVID itself,” he said. “I kind of was embarrassed and stayed quiet. Lots of people were unhappy that this was going on.” One such area is the West Samoset neighborhood of Bradenton, chock full of thrift stores and mini-marts, but no major grocery store or chain pharmacy. On a recent afternoon, in the shade of some trees in Martin Luther King Jr. Park, brothers Anthony and Jeff Warrick explained that they would love to get the vaccine, but really didn’t know where to start. “We don’t have access to a computer,” said Jeff Warrick, 59, who added that he heard the vaccines had gone to the wealthier part of the county. “They sent ’em all out to Lakewood Ranch, where the money is.” A few blocks away, Willie Smith did have access to a computer, but as of last week, had still not been able to get an appointment. He had only recently found out he could get a vaccine through one of the drug stores and was unaware of the county’s waitlist for scheduling slots. “They haven’t been doing a good job of broadcasting it,” he said. Pierce said the episode has left her reluctant to get drawn into conversations about the vaccine with friends and acquaintances. “I kind of was embarrassed and stayed quiet,” she said. “Lots of people were unhappy that this was going on.” Pierce and Fine, though, are and have been active Democrats. Whether DeSantis’ rollout of the vaccine will offend non-Democrats a year and a half from now, when the pandemic will likely be a fading memory, is unclear. Indeed, his focus on more affluent senior citizens in the first wave of vaccinations may not be offending Republican-leaning voters even today. John Yarema said he spent weeks calling Sumter County’s health department trying to get an appointment without any luck. “We called and called and called,” he said, before finally getting slots for himself and his wife in mid-March. The retired lawyer from Allentown, Pennsylvania, is 80 and lives in Bushnell, the county seat a half-hour away from The Villages, where DeSantis held a press conference on Jan. 12 to announce the creation of a clinic that residents could ride their golf carts to. Yarema said he wishes the state could have set up a pop-up clinic in Bushnell — which has a median household income about half that of The Villages — at the same time. As he loaded supplies from the town’s Winn-Dixie into his car last week, he nevertheless said he cannot blame DeSantis, whom he said he would support if he runs for president, given how many senior citizens live in the retirement community. “I can understand why he wanted to do it at The Villages,” he said, adding that his two month-delay doesn’t really bother him because he just continued doing what he had been doing for the past year of the pandemic. “I didn’t go out that much.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the location of Lakewood Ranch.

15,Biden Pedals Back Low Refugee Cap After Backlash,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost President Joe Biden will announce an increase in refugee admissions next month, the White House said Friday, a reversal from a statement hours earlier that he would leave in place the historically low cap set by President Donald Trump. The White House faced heavy criticism for leaving Trump’s refugee target ― only 15,000 people to be admitted this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30 ― in place. Democrats, refugee groups and immigration advocates said the decision was misguided and wholly unnecessary. They also speculated it might be political ― meant to stymie criticism from the right that Biden was allowing in too many asylum-seekers at the border even though refugee admissions are separate from border matters. Biden pledged in February that he would raise the cap to 62,500 refugees for this fiscal year and 125,000 for the next, but he never formally signed the directive — throwing the plans of hundreds of refugees into limbo. His new cap has not yet been determined but is unlikely to be as high as 62,500 for the year. “We expect the President to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a Friday afternoon statement. Psaki said that the administration determined it was unlikely to meet that number “given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited, and burdens on the Office of Refugee Resettlement.” The ORR is the office of the Department of Health and Human Services that handles refugees and unaccompanied minors who are apprehended at the border. But experts and refugee groups argued that ORR can handle both and that there’s no need to thwart one vulnerable population in favor of another. “The harm caused by the delay cannot be overstated — thousands of refugees who were ready for travel to the United States last month have seen their medical and security checks start to expire,” Meredith Owen, director of policy and advocacy for the refugee resettlement group Church World Service, said in a statement. She added, “The United States can and should be resettling refugees — and welcoming asylum seekers and unaccompanied children — as it seeks to retake the mantle of moral leadership around the world.” Biden’s delay in moving on refugees has already caused significant pain. Hundreds of refugees who had been approved to resettle in the U.S. have had to cancel flights. By the beginning of April, the Biden administration had resettled only 2,050 refugees for the fiscal year. The Biden administration said it was taking steps to speed up and improve resettlement. One is to adjust the allocations set by Trump ― which prioritized Iraqis who worked for the U.S. military and Christians facing religious persecution ― and would provide more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America. But Trump’s ban on refugees from several Muslim-majority countries will remain. Under Biden’s new allocation, about 7,000 slots are reserved for refugees from Africa, 1,000 from East Asia, 1,500 from Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 1,500 from the Near East and South Asia. There is also a reserve of about 1,000 slots to be used as needed. Families affected by the delay previously told HuffPost that they spent weeks furnishing their homes and preparing for the arrivals of their loved ones. Thousands of miles away, refugees made their own preparations and sold off many of their belongings and homes in preparation for their flights. Many refugees were worried that their security and health checks needed to board their flights were expiring. For months, Democratic lawmakers, resettlement agencies and activists have called on Biden to fulfill his promise. Earlier on Friday, several House Democrats wrote a letter to the president, urging him to officially raise the refugee cap that has trapped families in limbo. The White House had previously said that Biden remained committed to the issue but hasn’t given any further explanation for the delay on signing a directive increasing the cap on refugees. People close to the White House speculated that the president was concerned about political optics as he dealt with the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrants at the border seeking asylum are processed in an entirely separate system than refugees fleeing persecution overseas. “The asylum process at the southern border and the refugee process are completely separate immigration systems,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement after the initial announcement. “Conflating the two constitutes caving to the politics of fear.” Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Dozens Of House Democrats Urge Biden To Lift Refugee Cap,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Dozens of House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to make good on a campaign promise to lift the cap on refugee admissions into the United States. The White House announced in February that it would raise the limit imposed by former President Donald Trump, but Biden still hasn’t signed the necessary paperwork to make it official. The policy has left hundreds of refugees fleeing war and political turmoil around the world in limbo. Top Democrats on Capitol Hill are unsure about the reason for the delay. “Having fought for four years against the Trump Administration’s full-scale assault on refugee resettlement in the United States, we were relieved to see you commit to increasing our refugee resettlement numbers so early in your Administration,” Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter on Friday. “But until the Emergency Presidential Determination is finalized, our refugee policy remains unacceptably draconian and discriminatory.” The letter was signed by Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), a former refugee from Somalia, Pramila Jayapal (Mich.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), and dozens of other House Democrats. Later Friday morning, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters: “I expect we’ll have some more news on this today. Stay tuned.” Biden is on pace to accept the fewest refugees of any modern president, including Trump, according to a new report. (Halfway through this fiscal year, only 2,050 refugees have resettled in the U.S.) He could change that with the flick of a pen. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently told HuffPost she’s expecting to hear more from Biden’s administration explaining the reason for the delay. White House officials have repeatedly said that Biden is committed to lifting the cap on admissions. But they have failed to provide an actual explanation for continuing Trump’s refugee policy. According to CNN, Biden has resisted lifting the cap because of “political optics.” His administration has faced heat from Republicans over its handling of the growing influx of migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border. GOP lawmakers claim Biden’s immigration policies have directly contributed to thousands of people, including many children, attempting to enter the U.S. from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. But, as CNN notes, the “southern border is separate from the refugee program, which dates back decades and has a thorough vetting process in place for refugees overseas to resettle in the US.” Indeed, many of the refugees who were approved and booked to arrive in the U.S. and who had their flights canceled at the last minute spent years undergoing the vetting process.

1,Senate Advances Bill Seeking To Address Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost A bill meant to address the rise of hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic advanced in the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote on Wednesday — but its future remains murky, given tepid support from Republicans. The legislation, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), would expedite a federal review of coronavirus-related hate crimes, expand public reporting of such incidents, and provide guidance detailing best practices to “mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID–19 pandemic.” The vote to begin debate on the measure was 92-6. Republicans only backed the initial vote on the condition they would have an opportunity to offer amendments. Their continued support will ultimately depend on whether top Senate leaders can agree on which amendments the chamber will consider in the coming days. “In consultation with the Republican leader, we can work out an agreement on other germane, non-gotcha amendments to the bill if senators have them,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Wednesday. “We should be able — and should really try in earnest — to reach a final resolution and pass the bill through the Senate very, very soon.” One amendment with bipartisan support is being offered by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas). Their bill, called the No Hate Act, would train law enforcement on investigating hate crimes, create a hate crimes hotline, and establish programs to rehabilitate perpetrators. Unlike the Blumenthal-Moran measure, however, Hirono’s bill includes specific references to COVID-19, a definition some GOP senators would like to broaden. “It seems to say the hate crime has to be linked to COVID, which is rather odd,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday when asked about the measure. Other Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed concerns about a provision in Hirono’s bill that would offer guidance to states on how to “mitigate racially discriminatory language.” Controversial amendments, if offered, could ultimately sink the bill. Hirono said Republicans have offered 20 amendments so far, though all aren’t likely to receive a vote. “Some of them have absolutely nothing to do with the bill,” she said on Wednesday. The Hawaii senator indicated her willingness to make changes to her bill, but she defended the reason why it was introduced ― namely, the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans that accelerated under former President Donald Trump. “It really came to the fore during COVID-19 and having a president calling it a ‘China virus,’ so I think it led to an increase in these kinds of attacks. That’s why there’s that framing to remind us, how did this happen?” Hirono said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,GOP Says Kamala Harris Is MIA On Immigration As She Announces Mexico Trip,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost House Republican leaders on Wednesday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of being absent on immigration matters ― even showing up to a press conference with a milk carton with Harris’ face on it, declaring her “missing” at the border. One problem: At the same time, Harris was holding a White House meeting on immigration and announcing her plans to visit Mexico and Guatemala. With that milk carton in hand, House GOP Whip Steve Scalise (La.) demanded to know why Harris, who President Joe Biden recently tapped to examine the root causes of migration at the Mexican border, wasn’t personally visiting the region. “She refuses to go down,” Scalise said. “But if she’s the vice president of the United States and the president put her in charge of this, Vice President Harris needs to go down to the border and see this for herself.” It seems as if ⁦@SteveScalise⁩ has a milk carton declaring @vp is “missing.” pic.twitter.com/rQC5pjYGYV “We think it’s important the press continues to ask the White House about the extent to which the president has said Vice President Harris is in charge at the border,” said House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (Wyo.). “Nobody seems to be in charge.” Harris, meanwhile, was at the White House heading into a meeting with experts on what is driving a surge in migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, a region known as the Northern Triangle. She announced an upcoming trip to the area and clarified that her role in Biden’s immigration policies isn’t border-specific. “The president has asked [Homeland Security] Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas to address what is going on at the border,” Harris said, per a White House pool report. “I have been asked to address the root causes, similar to what” Biden did as during his time as vice president to former President Barack Obama. Still evidently unaware that Harris was discussing her travel plans, Scalise speculated she was avoiding the border because of the effects of some of Biden’s executive orders. The president created a task force to reunite families separated at the border by former President Donald Trump’s policies, and began a review of a Trump-era program that has forced tens of thousands of people to remain in Mexico while their asylum cases are processed. Republicans have falsely claimed that Biden’s executive actions are responsible for the massive levels of unaccompanied children and teenagers coming across the border and filling up increasingly crowded shelters, rather than the years’ worth of broken U.S. immigration policies that Biden inherited three months ago. “Maybe because she doesn’t want to be associated with this disgraceful policy,” Scalise said of Harris not going to the border. “These open-border policies that were completely created by this president, Joe Biden, must be turned around,” said Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.). “This is a crisis that was created by President Joe Biden ... He broke this, and he needs to own it and he needs to fix it.” In reality, the surge in migrant children at the border is not unique to the Biden administration. There were significant spikes under Trump in 2019, and under Obama in 2014. The difference from the Trump administration is that Biden refuses to summarily kick children out of the country, sending them back to potential danger in Mexico or the home countries they fled. Instead, the Biden administration is reverting to the legal system of putting children through immigration proceedings to determine whether they can stay in the U.S. ― a system that takes more time, and means they need to stay with family or sponsors. That’s not stopping Republican leaders from trying to find a way to ding Biden on immigration, though, or to spin Trump’s legacy. Even if it means being dishonest. “You can go back to the Trump policies, ‘Remain in Mexico.’ Everybody will tell you that policy was working,” Scalise said. “The Border Patrol agents tell us.” That policy did keep people out of the United States ― at the cost of violent, unspeakable suffering.

3,Carrie-Anne Moss Says She Was Offered Grandmother Role 1 Day After Turning 40,social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Carrie-Anne Moss is speaking out against ageism and sexism in the movie industry. The Canadian actor, best known for the “Matrix” franchise and Netflix’s “Jessica Jones,” recently joined Justine Bateman for a conversation as part of a series hosted by New York’s 92nd Street Y. According to The Hollywood Reporter, she spoke at length about the “external pressure” she faces as a woman in Hollywood over the age of 40. Moss, 53, said she’d been warned by fellow actors that her opportunities would diminish in her 40s but shrugged off the notion at first, adding, “I don’t believe in just jumping on a thought system that I don’t really align with.” Sadly, it wasn’t long before she got a rude awakening. “Literally the day after my 40th birthday, I was reading a script that had come to me and I was talking to my manager about it,” Moss recalled. “She was like, ‘Oh, no, no, no, it’s not that role [you’re reading for], it’s the grandmother.’ I may be exaggerating a bit, but it happened overnight. I went from being a girl to the mother to beyond the mother.” The actor went on to note that she doesn’t feel men in her industry face the same level of scrutiny, adding, “You don’t feel like you’ve aged much and suddenly you’re seeing yourself onscreen.” “I would look at these French and European actresses and they just had something about them that felt so confident in their own skin,” added Moss, who will reprise the role of Trinity in a fourth “Matrix” film later this year. “I couldn’t wait to be that. I strive for that. It’s not easy being in this business.” The 92nd Street Y event was presented in conjunction with the release of Bateman’s new book, “Face: One Square Foot of Skin.” In it, the actor ― who got her start as Mallory Keaton in the 1980s sitcom “Family Ties” ― is critical of plastic surgery, which she describes as a “Ponzi scheme.” “In essence, a lot of these women are getting plastic surgery because they don’t want any of the things they assume will happen if they have wrinkles on their faces,” she said in an interview with Vanity Fair published last week. “They want to shove those things off. But the truth is those things could still possibly happen. And then you have two problems: You’ll still have the things you were afraid would happen as a result, and you’ve also cut up your face.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Chris Wallace Calls Out GOP Governor's Silence On Migrant Sex Abuse During Trump Era,social-justice," Senior reporter, HuffPost Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Sunday questioned Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about why he had attacked the Biden administration over reports of sexual assault at a migrant shelter despite being silent on the matter when President Donald Trump was in office. Abbott, a Republican, announced during a press conference Wednesday that his state had received complaints of sexual abuse at a federal facility that houses migrant youth. Abbott blamed President Joe Biden’s immigration policies and called for the facility to be shut down. But immigrant advocates condemned Abbott’s press conference as political theater, noting that he failed to speak up over widespread reports of sexual abuse at immigrant detention centers during the Trump administration. “Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual assault at migrant shelters during the Trump years,” Wallace said during his interview with Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” “Not to say that what’s going on now is right, but we couldn’t find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president.” Chris Wallace to Gov.

Not to say what's going on now is right, but we couldn't find one instance of you complaining & calling that out when President Trump was president."" pic.twitter.com/MgzWY7AGsv Abbott said there were “multiple differences” between how the Trump and Biden administrations handled the alleged sexual abuse, including the “constant communication” his office received from Trump officials on the matter. He went on to suggest that he was fully aware of the migrant sexual assault allegations during the Trump administration but didn’t speak out at the time because those complaints were filed with federal agencies. “The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies,” Abbott said. “So we have a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse as well as to investigate it and that’s exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed.” “Don’t fall prey to Democrats or others saying, ‘Well, Abbott didn’t complain about this in the past,’” he added. “What they need to focus on is exactly what I called attention to last month in Dallas, Texas, where I pointed out then that there were going to be instances of child sex abuse taking place.” The sex abuse Abbott cited Wednesday allegedly took place at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. More than 1,300 teens who crossed the border into the U.S. from Mexico without a parent or guardian are reportedly being held there. “In short, this facility is a health and safety nightmare,” Abbott told reporters Wednesday. “The Biden administration is now presiding over the abuse of children.” From 2014 to 2018, under the Obama administration and subsequent Trump presidency, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual harassment and abuse against government-run migrant shelters, The Texas Tribune reported. “The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons,” Jonathan Ryan, CEO of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said in a statement. “What the governor wants is for the Biden administration to stop allowing children to seek home and safety in this country,” Ryan added. “That is not the solution to the challenge we have in front of us. We must ensure the children are released as soon as possible and be reunited with their families in the U.S.” Watch Abbott’s full appearance on “Fox News Sunday” below. Need help?

11,Tucker Carlson: 'Obedient Voters From Third World' Are Replacing Me,social-justice," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson on Thursday served up a blatantly racist hot take on immigration at the border, saying Democrats are trying to “replace the current electorate” with “more obedient voters from the Third World.” (Watch the video below.) “That’s what’s actually happening,” the Fox News host insisted, dismissing suggestions he’s preaching “white replacement theory.” “Everybody wants to make a racial issue out of it,” he said. “This is a voting rights question.” Carlson, appearing on “Fox News Prime Time,” opined on an intro by anchor Mark Steyn, who attempted to link Delta Air Lines’ condemnation of Georgia’s new voting restrictions to undocumented immigrants flying without photo ID. (Immigrants are permitted on domestic flights without the usual forms of ID if they show a “notice to appear” form from their asylum application, which entails a background check, and pass rigorous additional verification and screening processes, the Transportation Security Administration said previously.) Carlson quickly mounted his anti-immigration soapbox and drew an odd parallel to parents adopting kids and giving them new bikes and twice the allowance as their other children. “I think we’re being replaced by kids that our parents love more,” he said. “I have less political power because they are importing a brand-new electorate,” he fumed. “Why should I sit back and take that?” Fast-forward to 7:40: General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,"More Than 300,000 Asylum-Seekers Are Trapped In Legal Limbo",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The backlog of asylum applicants waiting for a decision from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has grown to more than 386,000 as of September 2020, according to a new report from the nonprofit Human Rights First. HuffPost was given an early look at the report, released on Friday. U.S. law requires officials to conduct the initial asylum interviews within 45 days of the application and make a decision within 180 days, but many asylum-seekers have waited years for an answer, the report finds. Applicants are essentially stuck while they wait ― unable to legally work, pursue educational opportunities, or obtain medical care and housing. They live with the constant threat of possible deportation as they await permanent status. The report finds that the backlog isn’t improving so far under President Joe Biden, as delays continue to leave asylum-seekers in perilous situations indefinitely. Lack of resources for asylum officers, shifting immigration priorities and the anti-immigrant policies former President Donald Trump implemented have all contributed to the record-high number of pending applications. The Biden administration is considering overhauling the asylum system to speed up the process, amid criticism for its handling of the surge of migrants and asylum-seekers at the U.S. border. And Biden has already undertaken some reforms, including allowing some migrants to enter the country while their cases are being processed. But many asylum-seekers are still trapped at the U.S. border awaiting entry, including some who have waited for years. Others, including a pregnant woman who was reportedly in labor, were deported back to their home countries. “The asylum office is supposed to be providing humanitarian protection to refugees and their family members, and those failures put people’s lives at risk,” said Kennji Kizuka, senior researcher and policy analyst for refugee protection at Human Rights First. There are two ways of obtaining asylum in the United States. Under the affirmative process, an individual who is already inside the U.S. files an application with USCIS requesting an asylum interview. In the defensive process, an undocumented applicant requests an asylum interview during immigration court removal proceedings. In both processes, the government is then legally required to at least grant them an interview to determine whether they have grounds for their asylum case to proceed. Requests for asylum have increased every year under both processes, leading to the current backlog. In 2019, USCIS granted asylum affirmatively to 27,643 people, an increase of 13% over 2018 and 77% from 2017, according to the most recent report from the Department of Homeland Security. The agency also documented an increase of defensive asylum applications for the fifth consecutive year, from just 47,100 applications in 2014 to more than 210,700 applications in 2019. “For the past six years, the Asylum Division has received many more cases across all areas of its responsibilities than it has capacity to adjudicate. Nonetheless, the Asylum Division has actively pursued ways to effectively address the backlog,” Anita Rios Moore, a USCIS spokesperson, told HuffPost in an email. The majority of those asylum-seekers came from China, Venezuela and El Salvador. Unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras accounted for 92% of all unaccompanied child asylum applications in 2019 and made up the majority of affirmative asylum applicants from those countries. These trends have contributed to the bureaucratic chaos the Biden administration inherited, but so have underfunding, lack of resources, constantly shifting enforcement strategies and other flawed policies. During both the Obama and Trump years, 89% of USCIS asylum officers were temporarily reassigned from handling asylum cases to other duties, the report notes. Under Obama, those officers were ordered to screen asylum-seekers placed in expedited removal proceedings, the process in which immigration officials rapidly decide whether or not an immigrant will be deported. An individual can only avoid deportation if they request asylum or express a fear of return to their home country, and are then referred to an asylum officer, who will conduct a credible fear interview — all of which take up substantial time and resources from asylum staff. Trump’s policies made conditions even worse. The 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” forced individuals to return to Mexico as they awaited court hearings. And Title 42, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented in March 2020, allowed border officials to send back individuals at the border to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Biden has rolled back the migrant protocols but has continued using Title 42. In March, Customs and Border Patrol expelled 103,900 people, or 60% of the total number of encounters. Despite the fact the agency has increased the number of authorized asylum officers from 273 in 2013 to 771 in 2019, closures under COVID-19 slowed the review of asylum applications. “Even after reopening of the asylum offices, necessary health precautions allowed for only limited interviewing of cases in-person. This, of course, has resulted in even further delay in the adjudication of cases,” Moore said. From 1995 to 2014, USCIS scheduled asylum interviews in the order of “last in, first out” (LIFO), prioritizing newer applications. But the agency reversed that strategy in 2014 and began scheduling asylum interviews in the order they were received as the backlog began to grow. In January 2018, the agency reverted back to the old policy due to high application volumes and “to deter individuals from using asylum backlogs solely to obtain employment authorization by filing frivolous, fraudulent or otherwise non-meritorious asylum applications,” according to an announcement from the Trump administration. “LIFO is a critical tool in controlling non-meritorious or fraudulent applications filed to take advantage of the backlog in order to obtain work authorization,” said Moore, noting that after reimposing LIFO, the number of affirmative asylum applications filed per year decreased and annual growth of the backlog has dropped. Advocates said the change has left some asylum-seekers waiting for years for a decision. As of April 2021, 80% of Human Rights First’s more than 300 clients in the USCIS backlog have been waiting for more than two years for an interview, with an average wait time of more than four years. “Historically USCIS had been receptive to processing expedited requests for family living in danger abroad, but many of the people that we spoke with for this report had not had their expedited requests approved,” said Anika Ades, a fellow with the organization’s refugee protection team. Those asylum-seekers are left feeling “powerless” and “stuck in this system without any way to move things along,” she said. Among them is 47-year-old Imran, a political activist from Pakistan now living in New York. HuffPost has agreed to use a pseudonym, as he fears retaliation in his country of origin should his application be denied. Imran grew up in a politically engaged family and started a nonprofit organization focused on women’s rights in his district, at a time where the Taliban ruled and forbade women from receiving an education and working in politics. The organization grew, and he began working with other international humanitarian groups. “During that time, a lot of schools were blown up and women weren’t allowed to go to schools. So we wanted to get women more involved, so mothers would be comfortable sending their daughters to school,” Imran told HuffPost via a translator over the phone. “We also wanted to work on political empowerment, because in national and local assemblies women did not have any representation.” But with the attention came threats; the Taliban accused him of being a foreign agent. In 2014, a group of assailants cornered and beat him and warned him to stop his political and social activities. A year later, armed men on motorcycles stopped the car he was riding in on his way home from a work meeting but Imran was able to hide. The armed men fired into the air and threatened to shoot him next. He knew he had to leave. Imran arrived in the U.S. in 2015, planning to stay for a few months until the situation calmed down. But his family and friends told him it was not safe for him to return. Even after he left, Imran’s relatives started receiving threatening phone calls asking about his whereabouts. “I still wanted to go back because I had my property, my life, over there. It was difficult to get work here without the appropriate authorization,” he said. “But ultimately, the situation was not getting better.” He can’t work or pursue an education. He has relied heavily on other Pakistanis In New York for housing and support. “Essentially there is no way out of this because you can’t go back and you’re not getting the benefits over here,” he said. “Essentially there is no way out of this because you can’t go back and you’re not getting the benefits over here.” After two years of waiting did he finally receive work authorization from USCIS, and got work as a security guard in a local mall. Then the pandemic hit, and he lost that job. He tries to stay active politically in New York, but he still worries about his wife and three children, who are still in Pakistan. His youngest daughter barely knows him, a pain that he says is killing him slowly. “If my family ends up in less than ideal circumstances or under bad influences, then there’s no point in living for me,” said Imran. The inability to work, fear of deportation and ongoing family separation are also a heavy mental burden for asylum-seekers. Hawthorne Smith is the director of the Bellevue Program for Survivors of Torture or PSOT, an interdisciplinary program based at Bellevue Hospital and associated with NYU School of Medicine in New York. The program has worked with more than 6,000 torture survivors from over 112 countries, the majority of whom are asylum-seekers. Smith, who runs a support group for French-speaking African torture survivors, said the latest change in how asylum cases are reviewed directly impacted clients who were at their breaking point. They don’t pick up the phone when loved ones call because they don’t have updates; it’s difficult to listen to their crying children who want to know when they can see them again. Other clients have contemplated dropping their asylum cases entirely just to return to their home countries and see their families, despite the threats on their lives. “We’ve been doing this now for 25 years, so it’s always been difficult, but what has happened over these last three years has really been unconscionable,” said Smith. While the “first in, first out” policy had its flaws, it made sense, Smith said. But now Smith has clients who applied for asylum years ago and are still waiting for their initial interview. Azeem, a journalist from Bangladesh facing government persecution for his work, fled to the U.S. in April 2016. He is also using a pseudonym due to fears of retaliation. The government had tried to censor his coverage of social and political crises, and in 2015 he was arrested and charged with sedition after his network aired a speech of the opposition party. The chair of his network was also arrested, part of an ongoing crackdown on free speech in the country as documented by the nonprofit Human Rights Watch. Azeem was blinded, handcuffed and tortured while in police custody and later put into jail for nine months. When he developed severe chest pains, hospitals refused to treat him because of orders from government officials. He didn’t think he would make it out alive. When the government finally released him, he initially resisted the idea of leaving his country. But he knew if he didn’t, the government would come back for him. He left his pregnant wife behind and fled to the U.S. with $1,000 in his pocket. “I took that risk to save my life,” Azeem told HuffPost. In the U.S., it took him two years to get an answer about whether he would be granted asylum. He found himself triggered whenever he saw a police car and struggled with severe post-traumatic stress-like symptoms. It wasn’t until nearly four years later that his wife and children were able to join him. He still struggles to create new memories with them ― making up for the lost time while beginning a new life in a new country. “I don’t know how I managed or how I will manage everything. A new life, new culture, new language, a new environment,” he said. “This is all utterly unexplainable mental pressure.” Azeem considers himself among the lucky ones, but said without support, surviving the backlog would have been impossible. He said he hopes that U.S. immigration sees the human toll behind its policies in order to change it for those vulnerable like himself. “People are oppressed and people are tortured, this is why most people come to the U.S. ― to save their lives,” he said.

13,Border Crossings In March Hit Highest Level In Over A Decade,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost More than 172,000 people, mostly single adults, attempted to cross into the U.S. at the southern border in March, 71% more than in February, according to statistics that Customs and Border Protection released Thursday. It the largest single-month total in at least 15 years. There was also a record number of unaccompanied minors in March: 18,890 children from Central America, double the February total and the largest single-month tally on record. The previous high of 11,475 unaccompanied minors occurred in May 2019. The migrant crossing record is testing the Biden administration’s ability to mitigate the surge and properly care for families and children at the border. The president and his top officials have refused to call the situation a “crisis,” repeatedly emphasizing that the government has inherited mayhem from the Donald Trump administration and that the current influx is akin to surges past administrations have faced. Biden administration officials told reporters that it is working with various government agencies and other partners to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible, including adding thousands of beds in facilities across Texas and elsewhere for unaccompanied children. Officials also said they were adding several emergency intake sites to reduce crowding in CBP facilities and avoid holding children for longer than the 72-hour legal limit. Officials noted that the 30-day daily average of children transferred out of CBP custody has risen from 276 at the end of February to 507 at the end of March. The administration had previously faced backlash as it struggled to provide adequate housing for the thousands of minors entering the country. “We’re going to utilize all of the options that we have available to us to safely care for the children who are in our custody, and that includes long-term and short-term solutions,” a Biden administration official told reporters in an informational call. According to Thursday’s data, CBP also expelled 103,900 people in March, or 60% of the total, under a Trump-era policy, known as Title 42, that allows border officials to turn away migrants in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials said 28% of those were people who had previously tried to enter and been turned away. Although Biden promised it would not use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors, immigration advocates say the policy is inhumane and ineffective, and should not be used to turn away adults either. Since taking office, Biden has made immigration a White House priority, reversing many of Trump’s hard-line policies. The Biden administration’s changes include offering millions a path to citizenship and revoking the 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, which forced individuals to return to Mexico as they wait for court hearings. Republicans in Congress have widely rebuffed the president’s immigration plan, largely refusing to support recent bills that passed in the House that would grant relief to immigrants living and working in the U.S. And while Republicans have attempted to blame Biden’s softer stance on immigration for the recent surge at the border, experts said the rise in migrants is more complicated, pointing to contributing factors such as violence in Central American countries, climate change and decades of failed immigration policies.

14,Doormen Fired After Closing Door On Asian American Woman Attacked In NYC,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Two doormen were fired after a man attacked an Asian woman on the sidewalk outside their building in late March and, rather than intervening or going out immediately afterward to help her, they closed the door. The Brodsky Organization, which owns the condo building in question on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, fired the workers on Tuesday, saying in a statement to the media that “required emergency and safety protocols were not followed” during the incident. The company noted that a full video (rather than the shorter clip that went viral) showed the doormen coming out of the building later to assist the woman and flag down a police car. The union that the doormen were part of, SEIU 32BJ, confirmed the firings to HuffPost and said that both employees had begun the process of filing a grievance challenging their terminations. The viral video of the incident shows a man viciously attacking a woman — later identified as 65-year-old Vilma Kari, who is Filipina — and repeatedly kicking her in the face. Police said the assailant had shouted anti-Asian slurs and told her “you don’t belong here.” In security footage, one of the doormen in the building’s lobby can be seen closing the door to the street after the assailant walks away and Kari is still on the ground. The workers were originally suspended after the video came out. NYPD says 65-year-old Asian American woman was walking to church this morning when suspect assaulted her and said “f*** you, you don’t belong here.” Happened in front of 360 W. 43rd St. 11:40am. Sources say building security guard not only failed to render her aid... 1/2 pic.twitter.com/ZLtQEHHJci New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time that it was “absolutely unacceptable” that bystanders did not intervene, adding: “I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker.” A suspect, Brandon Elliott, was later arrested and charged with felony assault as a hate crime, according to police. Kari sustained serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis, and has been released from the hospital, NPR reported. The attack sparked outrage as anti-Asian racism rises nationwide. Since last year, Asian Americans have been reporting a surge in racist violence, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting Asian American and Pacific Islanders rose by 150% in major U.S. cities, according to one study. Stop AAPI Hate recorded an alarming 3,795 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans from early 2020 to early 2021. People were called racial slurs, spat on and assaulted. The former doormen’s union said that it takes “anti-Asian hatred, and all forms of discrimination, seriously” and noted that its members are majority “immigrant, Black and brown workers” who face “much of the same racism and violence that our AAPI neighbors” do. “All union workers, especially workers of color who are often the subject of unfair treatment on the job, have a right to a fair process,” the union said.

15,"Over 4,000 Migrants, Many Kids, Crowded Into Texas Facility",social-justice," DONNA, Texas (AP) — More than 500 migrant children were packed into plastic-walled rooms built for 32 people, sitting inches apart on mats with foil blankets Tuesday at the largest U.S. Customs and Border Protection holding facility for unaccompanied children. Overall, CBP’s main child processing center, a compound of white tents in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, held over 4,100 migrants, more than 3,400 of them children who traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border alone and the rest of them families. It is designed for 250 people under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administration allowed journalists to see conditions for the first time since the facility opened Feb. 9 amid a spike in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border. It was a grim picture. A 3,200-square-foot (297-square-meter) space had been divided into several rooms for 32 children each under CDC guidelines, each separated by thick plastic walls instead of the chain-link fence used by previous administrations. Despite the health recommendations, one of the “pods” held nearly 700 kids, another had nearly 600 and others had just above 500. Everyone wore masks, but COVID-19 tests aren’t done unless they show symptoms. Doors to the rooms were open for free movement but there was little room to roam and no one to play games. Most children just sat on the ground close together, chatting quietly. Some were wrapped in foil blankets. Lights are dimmed at night. Children, most of them between 13 and 17, are separated by age. Families occupied a separate pod that was less crowded than the jam-packed rooms for older children. A room for “tender age” children from 3 to 9 years old consisted of a walled playpen with mats on the floor and far more space than the eight pods for older children. An 11-year-old boy cared for his 3-year-old sister, and a 17-year-old cared for her newborn. “I’m a Border Patrol agent. I didn’t sign up for this,” Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, said while looking at the younger kids. The children are processed in the tent-like facility in the Texas border town of Donna before being taken to longer-term care facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor. About two dozen of some 270 children being transferred to HHS midday tested positive for COVID-19 — the only time they are tested unless they exhibit symptoms earlier. Escamilla said the overall positivity rate at the Donna facility was about 14%. As they prepared to leave, children who tested negative for COVID-19 played soccer in the outdoor recreation area, where they can go three times a day when their pods are being cleaned. Those who tested positive for the virus gathered around metal benches off to the side and will still go to HHS centers. The Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than HHS is taking, leading to a severe backlog. The Border Patrol is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but HHS lacks space. More than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days. One child had been there 20 days. The average stay was 133 hours. “The intent of the Border Patrol is not detention. We’re not in the business of detention,” said Escamilla, the official who supervised the media tour. “We’re forced into the business because we can’t turn them over to anybody.” HHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere. A large HHS facility is being built near the holding center in Donna, separated by a chain-link fence. Noise from construction equipment filled the air near seven buses that were to take children to other HHS facilities. About 250 to 300 children enter the Donna facility daily and far fewer leave, a “lopsided” difference that Escamilla said was leading to more crowded conditions. It has held as many as 4,600 migrants. More than 17,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. custody as of Monday, about 12,000 with HHS and the rest with Customs and Border Protection. On Monday, 446 children entered CBP custody but only 229 went to HHS. HHS, which opened a facility Tuesday for 500 children at Fort Bliss in Texas, is working to build up to a capacity of 13,500 beds, spokesman Mark Weber said. Several hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. President Joe Biden has declined to resume his predecessor’s practice of expelling unaccompanied children. But his administration has continued expelling adults under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S. In some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually. Biden has faced intense pressure to bring more transparency to how large numbers of migrant children are being treated. In his administration’s first tour of the Donna holding facility, two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS shared text, photos and video with other news outlets as part of a pool arrangement. At the facility, children entered a tent with a dirt floor and three rows of bleacher-style seats. About 60 children waited to be admitted Tuesday, all wearing masks and seated close together. They then go into a small room for lice and scabies inspection and a general health check, including whether they have a fever. Their hair is hosed down. The facility is staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, who perform psychological tests, including asking children if they have had any suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces are removed to avoid harm to anyone. Amid the loud hum of air conditioning vents, children are led to a room for processing, with anyone 14 and older getting photographed and having their fingerprints taken. Younger kids don’t. In another room, agents ask them if they have a contact in the U.S. and allow the child to speak with them by phone. Plastic shields separate the agents and the children, who are seated at tables. They get bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered, medical conditions and any other personal information. All children are given notices to appear in immigration court, clearing the way for them to be released to Health and Human Services. About 1,200 children were ready for release Tuesday but there was nowhere to send them, Escamilla said. ___ Merchant reported from Houston."

0,Ted Cruz Complains He Was Taunted At The Border And You Know What Happened Next,social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) complained on Fox News on Monday that he was taunted during a photo op at the U.S.-Mexico border last week. In the footage from the trip, Cruz pointed into the bushes near the Rio Grande and spoke of unseen smugglers on the other side. “Just a few minutes ago there were multiple smugglers on the other side who were shining flashlights at us, who were yelling at us, who were taunting us,” he said. “Who were taunting, I think they probably assumed we were Border Patrol, but they routinely taunt the Border Patrol.” Cruz also complained in footage he posted on his Twitter feed last week about the “taunting.” But given that Cruz is often taunted elsewhere ― especially on Twitter ― more than a few critics did so again and several refered to a scene in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” featuring a literal taunter: Cruz’s latest trip came more than a month after he visited the other side of the border for a very different reason. He abandoned his home state in the middle of a major disaster to take a vacation in Cancun. As Texans struggled with freezing temperatures and sweeping power outages, Cruz and his family hung out at the Ritz-Carlton. Cruz returned the next day once word got out, tried to blame the trip on his daughters, then blamed the media and ultimately attempted to make jokes about it. For that and other reasons, the taunting followed Cruz from the border to Twitter: I would crawl thru broken glass to taunt Ted Cruz any day of the week and twice on Sundays. @tedcruz https://t.co/qWd1ID3BLY I can’t believe Ted Cruz survived this. How harrowing. pic.twitter.com/nzoXBD6xDe The tiny flashlight has killed me. I am dead  pic.twitter.com/Oepz7Dma4c Obviously, they had a smug look on their faces as they were taunting him.

1,Bowen Yang Offers Incredibly Powerful Message On 'SNL' Against Asian American Hate,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost “Saturday Night Live” cast member Bowen Yang began his “Weekend Update” bit against Asian American attacks all attitude and eye rolls, but ended with a powerful message to “fuel up” and keep moving — together. Yang first dinged co-anchor Colin Jost for introducing him as the program’s “Asian American cast member.” Jost responded: “That’s how you told me to introduce you.” “I set your ass up. It feels good,” Yang replied. But Yang got serious. “Things for Asians in this country have been bleak for the past two weeks — and all the weeks before that since forever,” he noted. He said he didn’t know what to say to help change “how insanely bad things are. If someone’s personality is ‘punch an Asian grandma,’ it’s not a dialogue. I have an Asian grandma. You want to punch her? There ain’t no common ground, Mama,” said Yang. He added: “I’m just a comedian. I don’t have all the answers. But I’m not just looking for them online. I’m looking around me. The GoFundMe for Xiao Zhen Xie, the grandmother who fought back against her attacker, raised $900,000, which she immediately gave back to the community. That’s where we are as Asians. Now come meet us there.” Yang said he tries to live by a Mandarin cheer that means “fuel up.” “I don’t know what’s helpful to say to everyone, but that’s what I say to myself. Fuel up, do more,” he added. “It’s the year of the metal ox, which basically means a car. So everyone, get in, buckle up. It’s no pee breaks.

2,Beto O'Rourke Says Ted Cruz Is 'Looking For A Crisis To Cosplay Senator For',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) on Friday blasted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a Twitter tirade, accusing him of fearmongering about an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border instead of focusing on issues directly affecting his constituents. “You’re in a Border Patrol boat armed with machine guns,” O’Rourke wrote in response to footage that Cruz had shared of himself at the shores of the Rio Grande, supposedly observing Mexican cartel members on the other side. “The only threat you face is unarmed children and families who are seeking asylum (as well as the occasional heckler). If you’re looking for a crisis to cosplay Senator for, I’m happy to point you in the right direction.” O’Rourke, who failed to unseat Cruz in a heated 2018 Senate race, went on to highlight a number of other Texas issues that he said Cruz was ignoring in lieu of harping on immigration woes at the border ― including mass shootings, the minimum wage and a lack of accessible health care. “The truth is, the number of individual asylum seekers and immigrants seeking to come to this country is the SAME or LOWER than it was in 2019 when Trump was President (and you were, apparently, Senator),” O’Rourke wrote. “This isn’t any more of a crisis today than it was then.” You’re in a Border Patrol boat armed with machine guns. The only threat you face is unarmed children and families who are seeking asylum (as well as the occasional heckler).If you’re looking for a crisis to cosplay Senator for, I’m happy to point you in the right direction. https://t.co/mDyWs6rQOM The state you “represent” in the Senate is the least insured in the nation. That means your constituents are dying of diabetes, curable cancers and the flu (as well as 50,000 from Covid in the last year alone) because they can’t afford a doctor or medicine. 110 Texans died in mass shootings in the last 2 years because you’re more concerned about taking care of the NRA than in taking care of the people you are supposed to serve.Families from El Paso, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe High, Midland/Odessa know what a real crisis is. Hundreds of thousands of working Texans make a minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which means they need to 2 or even 3 jobs just to pay the rent and put food on the table.And your hometown of Houston leads the nation in evictions of these minimum wage workers during the pandemic. The truth is, the number of individual asylum seekers and immigrants seeking to come to this country is the SAME or LOWER than it was in 2019 when Trump was President (and you were, apparently, Senator). This isn’t any more of a crisis today than it was then. If you’re ever interested in actually working on solutions to what we’re seeing at our border (instead of trafficking in seditious lies, fleeing Texas during a storm that killed more than 100, etc.), here are some ideas: https://t.co/D5idhhJ4w9 O’Rourke has not been the only one to level criticism at Cruz, who’s been touring the U.S.-Mexico border with 18 other Republican senators, including Sen. Lindsay Graham (S.C.), and blaming the Biden administration for a “humanitarian crisis.” Cruz’s detractors argue that the senator was not nearly as vocal about such conditions when the Trump administration was enforcing family separation at the border. They’ve also highlighted his getaway to Cancun, Mexico, last month when millions of Texans were left without power due to extreme weather. O’Rourke, who was one of many Democratic presidential hopefuls in the 2020 cycle, has frequently criticized Texas Republican leadership, arguing that “stupid culture battles” have turned the Lone Star State into a “failed state” and obscured more pressing problems, such as COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the local impact of the pandemic. The former representative has acknowledged the large numbers of migrants at the southern border this year, but argued that it is merely representative of a larger problem. He said the U.S. must work more closely with Central American governments and NGOs, and “rewrite our immigration laws to reflect the priority of family reunification, the contributions of millions of hardworking Americans who lack documentation and status in this country, & our desire to ensure a safe, legal path to come to this country.” Migrant numbers at the southern border are currently lower than the peaks reached two years ago, according to an analysis by CNN. That said, in May 2019, 11,475 unaccompanied minors were taken into federal custody, more than in any other month that year ― and in February 2021, more than 9,200 unaccompanied minors were arrested, a sign that this is already a heavy year for minors at the border. Republican lawmakers have been quick to criticize the Biden administration for struggling to handle the increase of people attempting to enter the U.S., though a number of reasons have contributed to this rise ― including COVID-19’s impact on Latin America and Hurricanes Eta and Iota, which struck the region in quick succession in November. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Texans who were recently left without power due to extreme weather. There were millions of such people, not hundreds of millions. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Trump Is Haunting Joe Biden’s State Department,social-justice," Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost More than two months into Joe Biden’s presidency, former President Donald Trump’s choices are still undermining the State Department, frustrating administration officials and victims of Trump-era moves such as his harsh crackdown on immigration. Biden’s own approach to appointing top officials is contributing to the problem, critics say, preventing the State Department from making critical progress. The president has yet to nominate anyone for the vast majority of posts he needs to fill at the agency, including the 22 assistant secretary positions that oversee State Department bureaus. He isn’t expected to tap his first slate of ambassadors until next month ― a full month later than President Barack Obama. And he has yet to give big jobs or a boost to career State Department employees who felt harassed, demoralized and undervalued under Trump. “There is a whole lot of diplomatic disappointment at the State Department and our embassies,” said Brett Bruen, a White House official under Obama and former diplomat. “It’s frustrating; there is no way around it. We wish there were more positions filled at this point.” The Trump administration’s reluctance to acknowledge the results of the 2020 election is at the root of the problem, observers say. Because General Services Administration head Emily Murphy waited until nearly three weeks after Election Day to begin cooperating with Biden’s transition team, the incoming president was delayed in providing the names of prospective nominees to the FBI for background checks. The upshot is that the procedure became “abnormally long,” even for former officials receiving new positions like U.S. Agency for International Development administrator nominee Samantha Power, said a congressional aide who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive confirmation process. If Biden chose, he could speed up the process by sending more nominations to Capitol Hill so consideration could begin even before their paperwork was fully completed, the aide added, noting that the president hasn’t yet identified candidates for many senior posts. “It’s frustrating; there is no way around it,” the aide said. “Putting ascertainment delays aside, we wish there were more positions filled at this point.” The slow pace of staffing the State Department is particularly worrying for two groups of experts on U.S. foreign policy: the agency’s career staff, and outside national security analysts hoping to help Biden fulfill his promise to bolster diplomacy and improve America’s handling of global affairs. Meanwhile, professionals in the foreign and civil service are watching as key roles go to politically connected figures. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a leading candidate to be the ambassador to China or Japan, for instance, and Cindy McCain ― the widow of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and one of the few Republicans to endorse Biden ― is certain to get a plum posting. Even figures with State Department backgrounds who already have or are expected to get high-profile posts, such as Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Victoria Nuland and Nicholas Burns, have cultivated strong political links apart from serving in government and rising through standard promotion procedures. Biden had said “current career officials would be elevated and empowered under this Administration,” Bruen told HuffPost via email. “Where the heck are they? Not one of them have been named to a leadership position at the State Department.” He noted that only one senior White House national security post is held by a State Department official. Until the department gets more high-ranking officials who are fully empowered and have the benefit of Senate confirmation, it’s hard for diplomats to map out next steps for their careers and to have influence in crafting Biden’s policies. Adding to career staffers’ concerns, Biden quickly selected aides for many White House national security jobs that do not require Senate consideration, possibly signaling he will continue the long-running trend of empowering the National Security Council to lead on foreign affairs rather than the State Department. A State Department spokesperson told HuffPost that Secretary of State Antony Blinken sees the agency’s staff as its “greatest asset.” “Under Secretary Blinken’s leadership, career experts will always be at the center of our diplomacy, and he is committed to ensuring that they will help to lead it by serving in many of the Department’s most senior positions,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “Addressing and filling vital senior leadership positions at the State Department is one of the Secretary’s highest and most immediate priorities, and the Department is working closely with the White House to identify and select qualified candidates.” “There is going to be a loss of talent at some point if a lot of the new next-generation thinkers get written off.” Beyond Foggy Bottom, aspiring officials who have cultivated international relations expertise but were reluctant to serve under Trump say the delay in appointments and Biden’s reliance on Obama-era personnel has led to confusion and a sense that it’s futile to continue to focus on government appointments over other opportunities. “It’s a black box… [and] it’s especially bad at State,” said one national security analyst who sought anonymity to preserve relationships. That uncertainty is driving fears that Biden will ignore new approaches to international relations and calls to include a more diverse range of voices in policy-making. “I talk to people all the time who have incredible backgrounds, and they have no idea how to go around getting in,” the analyst continued. “There is going to be a loss of talent at some point if a lot of the new next-generation thinkers get written off.” The analyst said they and many of their peers were considering taking their skills elsewhere, outside Washington and government work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The staffing delays may have ripple effects for people all over the world, dashing hopes of a quick and clear turn away from Trump’s disdain for most foreigners. In 2019, Mohamed Haggag, a 30-year-old engineer in Egypt, was one of thousands of people worldwide who won the U.S.’s annual visa lottery, which provides a pathway to move to America. But just months later, Trump stopped U.S. embassies from issuing new visas, saying more immigration would harm U.S. workers struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. Haggag said he expected “things under Biden would get better.” And the new president did revoke one of Trump’s pandemic barriers to entry last month. But that didn’t mean diversity visa hopefuls like Haggag could get back on track. He and others are still fighting in court for the right to even apply for the visa, despite their wins. Meanwhile, Biden’s State Department has said it will not issue visas to people who won the lottery for 2020 “as the deadlines for visa issuance in those fiscal years have expired.” It said that applied to lottery winners going back to 2017 ― confirming that it would not provide U.S. diversity visas to tens of thousands of lottery winners who were unable to obtain the visas they were entitled to because of Trump’s travel ban mainly targeting Muslim-majority countries. Manar Waheed, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said there is more the State Department could do. “This does not have to be a closed issue,” she said, arguing that the State Department could offer humanitarian parole to diversity visa winners as a temporary solution, enabling them to begin the process of moving as lawmakers tweak to the lottery rules to permit them to become U.S. citizens. “This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is something that can allow them to build lives in safety,” Waheed said. The American Civil Liberties Union also wants Biden to address other consequences of Trump-era policies to reduce immigration by expediting the processing of visa applications and reopening those that were denied to people simply on the basis of their nationality under Trump’s travel ban. With a backlog of tens of thousands of visa applications, however, and limited political power at the State Department so far, it’s hard to imagine the Biden administration pulling off a broad redo of Trump’s clampdown. “We continue to have a deep bench of experienced career professionals serving in key positions that are highly capable and able to help the Secretary lead the Department,” the agency spokesperson wrote to HuffPost. Still, for people hoping for sweeping change from the new administration, a long wait seems inevitable. “I only do two things in my life: I work and I follow the lottery news in America,” Haggag said.

11,Kamala Harris To Lead Biden Efforts To Control Border Migration,social-justice," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Kamala Harris will lead efforts to control the surge of migrants at the southern border, giving the vice president leadership over one of the administration’s most high-profile challenges. “This new surge we are dealing with now started in the past administration, but it is our responsibility,” President Joe Biden said Wednesday. He added that he could think of “nobody who is better qualified to do this.” The migration challenge is the first issue Biden has publicly asked Harris to lead, and it’s one he oversaw while serving as vice president under Barack Obama. Biden’s administration has been facing criticism from both parties over the unaccompanied children and teenagers coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly for the crowded facilities where they are being held. There are more than 14,000 migrant children in federal care right now. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has acknowledged that the U.S. is “on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years.” Harris will oversee the administration’s diplomatic efforts with the “Northern Triangle” countries — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — and work with them on both short- and long-term solutions to reduce migration to the United States. Her focus will be addressing the root causes that push people to come to the country. In an interview with CBS on Wednesday before the announcement, Harris said she and Biden will go down to the border “at some point,” emphasizing that solving the problem will not happen overnight. “Look, we’ve been in office less than 100 days,” she said. “We are addressing it. We’re dealing with it. But it’s going to take some time. And are we frustrated? Are you frustrated? Yes, we are.” “She comes into this partnership with the goals of trying to enhance prosperity, combat corruption and strengthen good governance and the rule of law. And those are the goals of the countries themselves,” an administration official told reporters. In March 2020, then-President Donald Trump invoked Title 42, a provision from a 1944 public health law that allowed him to send undocumented immigrants back to their home countries under the pretense of halting the spread of COVID-19. Biden is continuing Title 42 restrictions for most adults and some families ― a policy being challenged in court ― but he is allowing minors to stay in the U.S. That decision has led to unaccompanied minors being detained at the border as they await room in shelters or being placed with their family or sponsors in the United States. Mayorkas said Sunday that migrants should not be coming to the country without documentation ― but that the Biden administration would not be returning to the Trump policy of sending back children. “The border is closed,” he said. “We are expelling families. We are expelling single adults. And we’ve made a decision that we will not expel young, vulnerable children. I think we are executing on our plans. And quite frankly, when we are finished doing so, the American public will look back on this and say we secured our border and we upheld our values and our principles as a nation.” Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Bosses Are 'Thriving' Right Now — But Most Employees Say The Opposite,social-justice," Senior Reporter, Work/Life While many workers are overwhelmed and exhausted toiling through a pandemic, that is not the case for the majority of company leaders. According to Microsoft’s newly released Work Trend Index survey, 61% of business leaders say they’re “thriving” right now, while only 38% of workers without decision-making authority say the same. The global survey, which polled more than 31,000 full-time or self-employed workers from a variety of fields in 31 countries, including the United States, Canada, Brazil, China and Colombia, was conducted in January and its results were released on Monday. Business leaders in the survey were more likely to be male and farther along in their careers. Compared to workers without decision-making authority, they reported stronger relationships with colleagues and leadership, higher incomes, and a higher likelihood of taking all of their allotted vacation days. The survey shows a wide disconnect between these business leaders who are thriving in established careers and younger workers. Sixty percent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 25 said they are merely surviving or are struggling right now at work. These early-career workers were more likely to feel exhausted after a work day and had more difficulty getting a word in during meetings compared to what was reported by older generations in the survey. “There is an income difference between managers, particularly senior managers, and those at the individual contributor side. And that impacts everything. That impacts their perception of work, and what is equitable.” Gregory Tall, a workshop facilitator who coaches managers, said one dynamic that could explain the disconnect is money. “There is an income difference between managers, particularly senior managers, and those at the individual contributor side,” said Tall. “And that impacts everything. That impacts their perception of work, and what is equitable in terms of how much time you spend [at work] to life outside of work, what you can afford.” Tall said he’s heard of bosses who are thriving working remotely while their younger employees may be struggling to work around roommates and unreliable Wi-Fi. “The people who have money to have a house that’s big enough where they’re not putting themselves and others at risk, or a second home to go to if things get too crazy living out of their apartment in the city, etc. ― they are going to, as unhappy as they are, do better in the pandemic than people who live in a smaller space where they’re not as protected, where they have to take public transportation to get to work, and where they need to be at work in order to earn a living,” said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. “One of the pandemic problems is this disconnect between managerial work and kind of frontline work or manufacturing work.” While the status quo may be working for the majority of bosses in the global survey, nearly 1 in 5 professionals said their employer doesn’t care about work-life balance, and the majority said they were overworked. It’s no wonder, then, that 41% of the respondents said they are likely to consider leaving their current employer within the next year. Tall said he has observed this disconnect between leaders and staff when hearing managers say, ’‘‘Oh, this person resigned suddenly.’ And it’s like, ‘No, it was sudden for you.’ They’ve been thinking about this for probably months.” In his experience, Tall said, workers who quit for another job are doing so because “they’ve exhausted the other viable, much easier options,” such as switching teams or working on different projects. If you are a boss who is surprised by these survey results, take time to reflect on where the disconnect may be coming from and how it can be addressed. To facilitate a more candid check-in with staff, Tall suggests moving away from asking the perfunctory question “How are you doing?” to asking more specific questions, such as “What is the biggest challenge you are facing working from home?” Then, Tall said, “People can’t say, ‘Oh, it’s fine.’ Now we’re getting someplace.” Senior Reporter, Work/Life"

On “The Five,” Pirro argued that during a recent trip to the area, she saw that the border was open. “The bringing of these children into this country, where they will be forever connected to a cartel, is slavery,” she said. “What we’re doing here is we are promoting a lower level of human being, who will be controlled from other countries.” “So stop trying to make this about this is who ― not who we are,” she added. “This is about crime coming into this country and it’s a reality. And we’re losing.” A number of critics on social media called out her “lower level of human being” comment as overt white supremacy and likened it to Nazi rhetoric. A key tenet of Nazi ideology was to define and portray Jews as untermenschen, or subhuman. It’s the second time this month Pirro has been compared to Nazis over her remarks on immigration.

14,U.S. Billionaires Grew Wealth By Over $1.3 Trillion In Past Year Of Coronavirus Pandemic,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Billionaires in the U.S. have grown their wealth by nearly 45% — or by more than $1.3 trillion — since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nation last March, according to a new report. A report released by the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness on Tuesday tracked the net worth of the wealthiest Americans from March 18, 2020 to March 18, 2021, and found that 43 people had joined the billionaire ranks over this past year, based on data from Forbes. Among those who’ve seen their wealth grow the most in the last 12 months are Tesla founder Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg. Meanwhile, over the past year, the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has left tens of millions of Americans unemployed and struggling financially. The U.S. unemployment rate was over 6% last month — with about 10 million people considered unemployed — far above the levels of last February, when unemployment was around 3.5% and about 5.7 million were counted as unemployed. “The pandemic profiteers are extracting windfalls of wealth during a time of widespread suffering for the majority of people,” Chuck Collins, director of IPS’s program on inequality, said in a release. As Bezos has seen his net worth swell from $113 billion at the start of the pandemic to over $178 billion a year later — or a 58% increase — Amazon has been aggressively working to quash unionization efforts at its Alabama warehouse. Workers there are fighting for better pay and working conditions. A spokesperson for Amazon told HuffPost that starting pay was $15.30 per hour and that the company “offers some of the best jobs available.” More than 542,000 people have died in the U.S. since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the surge, and immigration officials halting the acceptance of adults and families, the Biden administration has refused to label the current situation a “crisis,” a term that Mayorkas again on Sunday deflected. “I will not use language that is not applicable,” he said on MSNBC’s “The Sunday Show.” “We have dealt with surges in migration at the border before. We have a plan, we are executing our plan, we will succeed. We know what to do, we are doing it, and that is the fact of the matter.” Mayorkas blamed the previous Trump administration for both the rise in cases and for the immigration system’s inability to handle it all. He argued that people have been increasingly forced to flee their countries and seek refuge in the U.S. because the Trump administration cut off humanitarian aid to their countries, making an already dire situation worse. Mayorkas also accused the previous administration of dismantling the immigration system amid a pandemic. “We are rebuilding those orderly systems both in Mexico, in close partnerships with the Mexican government, and in the countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,” he said in his interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Career immigration officials had warned of a potential migrant surge after the November presidential election and news that Trump’s hardline immigration policies were being reversed, the Associated Press reported. “They see him as the migrant president,” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said of President Joe Biden following a virtual meeting with his U.S. counterpart on March 1. “And so many feel they’re going to reach the United States.” Republicans on Sunday accused the Biden administration of actually encouraging the rush of migrants, particularly by allowing refuge to unaccompanied minors. “Encouraging these kids to come is not a humane thing,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the leading Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “It’s certainly overwhelming our system.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) on Sunday shared a similar sentiment. “The border is wide open,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “He’s basically saying that the U.S. will not secure our border and that is a big welcome sign to migrants from across the world.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Sandra Oh Calls To Stop Anti-Asian Hate In Powerful Speech: 'I Am Proud To Be Asian',social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sandra Oh is calling for an end to anti-Asian violence in the wake of the shooting rampage in three Atlanta-area spas this week that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. The “Grey’s Anatomy” alum joined thousands across the country who rallied in various cities over the weekend to demand justice for the victims of the shootings and decry the recent surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. On Saturday, Oh made a surprise appearance at a Stop Asian Hate rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she’s currently filming her new Netflix series “The Chair.” After introducing herself and thanking the organizers for giving supporters the “opportunity to be together, stand together and feel each other,” Oh addressed the crowd with a brief but stirring speech. “For many of us in our community, this is the first time we are even able to voice our fear and our anger, and I really am so grateful for everyone willing to listen,” Oh, holding a megaphone, said in videos, which have been widely shared across social media. “One thing that I know is that many in our community are very scared, and I understand that. And one way to go through our fear is to reach out to our community.” BREAKING: Sandra Oh speaks at a “Stop Asian Hate” demonstration in Oakland to about 250 people. “I am proud to be Asian,” she says. “We belong here.” pic.twitter.com/BCAtBpn4QQ Actress Sandra Oh speaks during the Stop Asian Hate rally in Pittsburgh pic.twitter.com/Bgels4hNio “To everyone here … I will challenge everyone here, if you see something, will you help me? If you see one of our sisters and brothers in need, will you help us?” she said, as the people chanted, “Yes!” in response. “We must understand, as Asian Americans, we just need to reach out our hand to our sisters and brothers and say, ‘Help me and I’m here.’” Oh concluded her speech by yelling, “I am proud to be Asian! I belong here!” before encouraging other community members to do the same. “Many of us don’t get that chance to be able to say that, so I just wanted to give us an opportunity to be able to shout that,” she said. Days before the rally, Oh posted on Instagram about the Atlanta shootings with a message directing her followers to support and donate to several organizations benefitting the Asian community. A post shared by Sandra Oh (@iamsandraohinsta) The “Killing Eve” star is one of a slew of celebrities to condemn anti-Asian violence in recent days. Gemma Chan, Lana Condor, Rihanna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ariana Grande, Daniel Dae Kim and others have spoken out publicly against the attacks. “Please pay attention to what is happening. This is the latest in a surge of horrific attacks on the Asian community,” Chan wrote on Instagram earlier this week. “Racism and misogyny are not mutually exclusive. In fact, sexualised racial harassment and violence is something that many of us face regularly.” “Wake up… your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs, and wildly angry,” Condor added in a separate post. “Please please please check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren’t publicly grieving on social media.” A post shared by Gemma Chan (@gemma_chan) Wake up... your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs and wildly angry.

For Asian Americans, that moment is now,” the Korean-American actor said in his speech. “What happens right now and over the course of the coming months will send a message for generations to come as to whether we matter, whether the country we call home chooses to erase us or include us, dismiss us or respect us, invisibilize us or see us. Because you may consider us statistically insignificant now, but one more fact that has no alternative is that we are the fastest-growing racial demographic in the country. We are 23 million strong. We are united, and we are waking up.” Daniel Dae Kim on House bill condemning anti-Asian sentiment: ""I was disheartened to find that for a bill that required no money or resources, just a simple condemnation of acts of hate ...164 members of Congress—all Republican—voted against it."" https://t.co/Apq0AYUMdR pic.twitter.com/B2ZY10Rwlo Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Gregory Bush Pleads Guilty To Federal Hate Crimes In 2018 Kroger Shooting,social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost Gregory Alan Bush pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes on Thursday for shooting and killing two Black people at a Kroger grocery store in Kentucky in 2018, and attempting to murder a third. The 53-year-old white Louisville resident previously pleaded guilty but mentally ill to state charges for murder, attempted murder and wanton endangerment, and was sentenced to a life term in state prison. Bush admitted in his plea hearing Thursday to having shot and killed Maurice Stallard, a 69-year-old Black man, at close range on Oct. 24, 2018. Stallard was shopping with his grandson in the store. After Bush’s first encounter, he exited the store and walked up to a Black woman in the parking lot, shooting and killing 67-year-old Vickie Lee Jones. Bush said he had no prior relationship with either individual and targeted both victims because of their perceived race. He attempted to murder a third individual ― a Black man armed with a legal handgun who exchanged gunfire with Bush in the parking lot ― but was unsuccessful. After his third encounter, another armed man, who was white, confronted Bush in the parking lot. Bush responded, “Don’t shoot me [and] I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites,” according to authorities. Bush attempted to enter a predominantly Black church in the area that day before he drove to the Kroger, but was unable to gain entry, police said at the time. “Today’s guilty plea will ensure that a violent and disturbed man will never get another chance to target and terrorize the Black community,” Pamela S. Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “It won’t bring back two pillars of the Louisville community, whose tragic and senseless deaths we mourn, but we hope it sends the message that the Justice Department will work tirelessly to bring perpetrators of bias-motivated violence to justice,” Karlan said. Bush is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court this June, where he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. National Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Immigration Is The First Big Intraparty Struggle Of The Biden Era,social-justice," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden’s administration is struggling to deal with an increase in migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and Republicans who insist it’s all Democrats’ fault, further complicating an already murky path for overhauling the country’s immigration system. On Thursday, the House passed legislation giving a pathway to citizenship to the young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers” and to 400,000 immigrants living with temporary protected status, as well as a separate piece of legislation granting legal status ― but not citizenship ― to millions of undocumented farmworkers. But making either of those bills a legal reality ― never mind potentially crafting a large-scale deal with the GOP to grant legalization to millions of other undocumented immigrants ― looks increasingly difficult. Democratic aides, legislators and operatives are divided on what path to take, and most Republicans are more interested in turning the border crisis into a winning political issue than in seeking out compromise. “While the situation at the border does need its proper attention and response, let’s not get distracted here,” said California Sen. Alex Padilla, who has pushed other Democrats to pass immigration legislation since taking office earlier this year. “I think this underscores the urgency for a long-overdue change in immigration policy.” After the relatively smooth passage of the popular $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan for coronavirus relief, this past week’s actions on immigration show how Biden and Democrats could struggle to make large parts of their agenda a reality as fresh crises appear and their razor-thin congressional majorities fail to overcome a united Republican party. The situation at the border is clearly pulling focus from broader reform efforts. Biden administration officials held a conference call with reporters on Thursday not to discuss the path forward for legislation ― but to address their efforts to deal with a surge of migrants that began under Donald Trump’s presidency. U.S. officials encountered migrants crossing the border with Mexico more than 100,000 times in February, the first time since 2019 that migration was that high, and families and unaccompanied children made up 29% of that mix ― a sharp increase since the end of Trump’s presidency. There are now more than 14,000 migrant children in federal custody, and the Department of Health and Human Services ― which is responsible for caring for child migrants apprehended without their parents ― is struggling to find adequate shelters amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Administration officials said on the conference call it could take months to find them acceptable accommodations. Republicans, led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), have blamed Biden’s promises for a more humane immigration system and his administration’s move to end harsh policies targeting asylum-seekers for drawing migrants to the border in larger numbers. “They are sending the message that anyone who makes the dangerous journey to cross the border will be rewarded,” McCarthy said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday, later accusing Democrats of “wasting time on a bill that could not be less timely or targeted to the issue at hand.” Biden administration officials have dismissed that argument, instead pointing to the devastation wreaked by two hurricanes that struck Central America this year and noting that 2019 was a record year for migration despite Trump “ripp[ing] over 3,000 children from their parents’ arms,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters. “Deterrence and language alone are not sole factors of migration decisions,” the official continued. “There are many Republicans who don’t want us to fix this broken immigration system. They’re going to their biggest red meat issue. This was Trump’s play all the time, over and over and over again.” Still, there appears to be some effort from the Biden administration to tell migrants to stay away. Biden himself delivered a message in an interview with ABC News. “I can say quite clearly: Don’t come over,” he said, reiterating that most adults and family are being sent back across the border or to their home countries. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who ran for president on one of the most liberal immigration plans in decades, told reporters that Republicans were using the border crisis to derail the push for immigration reform and to distract from the Biden administration’s popular COVID-19 relief package. “There are many Republicans who don’t want us to fix this broken immigration system,” Castro said on a conference call while reiterating that he hoped many immigration measures could earn bipartisan support. “They’re going to their biggest red meat issue. This was Trump’s play all the time, over and over and over again.” Republicans are largely unified in their opposition to broader immigration reform, with four years of defending Trump’s hard-line policies under their belts. The GOP, which faces internal splits over how to deal with Trump, national security and economics, sees relatively little dissent on immigration issues. “The Biden administration is creating chaos where there was order,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the Republicans who led negotiations during the last major attempt to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, said during a press conference on Wednesday. “The only way we’ll be able to sit down with our Democratic colleagues is for us to regain control of the border.” Republican operatives say their internal polling points to immigration as a potential weakness for Biden and Democrats ahead of the ’22 midterm elections. A Pew Research Center survey released earlier this month found 53% of Americans had confidence in Biden’s decision on immigration policy ― lower than 65% of Americans who had confidence in his ability to fight the coronavirus or the 56% who had confidence in his handling of the economy. While Democrats were united on both bills that passed Thursday, two Latino members of Congress from South Texas ― Reps. Henry Cueller and Vicente González ― had warned of the pending migrant surge. Other moderate Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, have not been shy about calling the situation a “crisis” ― a term White House officials have made a point of avoiding. The Biden administration sought to make a big splash on immigration, releasing a comprehensive bill ― although one without the improvements to border security Republicans would like to see ― on his first day in office. But there are divisions among Democrats on how to move forward on immigration. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Democratic leadership, told reporters earlier this week he did not think there were votes to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill this Congress. Durbin’s comments prompted New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the lead Senate sponsor of the Biden administration’s comprehensive immigration proposal, to warn Durbin not to “wave the white flag” just yet. Padilla has pushed for Democrats to use the budget reconciliation process ― which only requires 50 votes in the Senate rather than a filibuster-mandated 60 votes ― to adopt a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who did essential work during the COVID pandemic. He said he would like to start with a comprehensive proposal and turn to a piecemeal approach if it fails. “I’m for getting as much done as quickly as possible,” he said. “We’re having those conversations in real time on both sides of the aisle.” Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,"House Passes Bills To Protect Dreamers, Undocumented Farmworkers",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The House passed two major immigration reform bills on Thursday, securing the first step in President Joe Biden’s plan to grant a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people. But the bills are likely to stall out in the Senate, which Democrats narrowly control ― making the chances for immigration reform unlikely given heavy Republican opposition. The House passed the American Dream and Promise Act in a 228-197 vote, with nine Republicans voting in favor. The bill would provide a path to citizenship for the 2.5 million young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as the 400,000 immigrants living in the country with temporary protected status, or TPS. The chamber later approved a second bill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, in a 247-174 vote. Thirty Republicans voted to approve the bill and one Democrat ― Rep. Jared Golden of Maine ― voted no. That second bill would allow eligible undocumented farmworkers to apply for legal status and is the biggest legalization effort with broad Republican support. A majority of the country’s roughly 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented. The bills would be life-changing for undocumented immigrants. While many Dreamers are currently protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, they remain at risk of deportation and lack permanent status. Both bills have support from the White House. “Ensuring that Dreamers and TPS recipients have a clear path to citizenship would deliver much-needed economic security and stability to millions of people who currently face perpetual uncertainty and vulnerability as a result of their immigration status,” read a statement from the White House released on Thursday. Biden urged all members of the House to vote in favor of the bills in a tweet and said it was “long past time Congress gives a path to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS recipients who strengthen our country and call our nation home.” It’s long past time Congress gives a path to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS recipients who strengthen our country and call our nation home. I strongly support the Dream and Promise Act and urge all members of the House to vote yes. But immigration reform is always a heavy lift in Congress ― and particularly now, after former President Donald Trump spent years pushing anti-immigrant and restrictionist policies with the support of most Republicans. It has been more than three decades since Congress enacted broad immigration reforms, and anything proposed since then has struggled to gain enough support. In 2019, both bills passed the House at the time but were never taken up in the then-Republican-led Senate for a vote. Earlier this week, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that he was not optimistic of the legislation garnering enough bipartisan support. “I don’t see a means of reaching that,” said Durbin, who has been championing protections for Dreamers for two decades. “I want it. I think we are much more likely to deal with discrete elements” of such a plan. The vote comes at a time where the Biden administration is facing scrutiny amid the biggest surge of migrants at its southwestern border in 20 years. More than 100,000 migrants were apprehended at the border with Mexico in February, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Another several thousand unaccompanied minors were also in CBP custody as of last Sunday held in shocking conditions, prompting outrage from lawmakers and activists alike. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an immigration reform supporter-turned Trump ally who co-sponsored the Dream Act with Durbin, said Wednesday that Republicans will not work on immigration measures without changes in border policy. “The Biden administration is creating chaos where there was order,” Graham said. “The only way we’ll be able to sit down with our Democratic colleagues is for us to regain control of the border.” During the floor vote Thursday, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) stated that the issue at the border was not an excuse. “I have no doubt that some of my Republican colleagues will stand before us today and use what they claim as a crisis at the border as an excuse not to support this bill,” he said. “But let’s get one thing straight. This legislation is not about the border. This legislation is about finally delivering on our promise to America’s dreamers and others who are equally deserving of our protection.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"Asian Americans Grieve, Organize In Wake Of Atlanta Attacks",social-justice," Asian Americans were already worn down by a year of pandemic-fueled racist attacks when a white gunman was charged with attacking three Atlanta-area massage parlors and killing eight people, most of them Asian women. Hundreds of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders turned to social media to air their anger, sadness, fear and hopelessness. The hashtag #StopAsianHate was a top trending topic on Twitter hours after the shootings that happened Tuesday evening. “I think the reason why people are feeling so hopeless is because Asian Americans have been ringing the bell on this issue for so long ... We’ve been raising the red flag,” said Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Atlanta-based Asian American Advocacy Fund, which does political and advocacy work across Georgia. Many were also outraged that the suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, was not immediately charged with hate crimes. Authorities said Long told police the attack was not racially motivated, and he claimed that he targeted the spas because of a “sex addiction.” Six of the seven slain women were identified as Asian. Law enforcement needs “some training understanding what a hate crime is. This man identified targets owned by Asians,” said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The gunman “was very clearly going after a targeted group of people.” Being Asian American herself, Huang said the shootings felt personal. She is worried that not classifying the attack as a hate crime will “absolutely discourage others from coming forward and seeking help.” She also cringed at the comments of a sheriff’s captain who said of the gunman, “It was a really bad day for him.” The remark “appeared to be trying to explain and justify” the suspect’s actions. “Hopefully it was a misstatement,” Huang said. Mahmood said Asian American business owners in the Atlanta area were already fearful because of incidents like graffiti and break-ins. The shootings will raise that worry to new heights. “A lot of Asian American business owners in the beauty parlor industry and food service — these are often the most visible front-line faces in the community,” Mahmood said. Her organization is partnering with other groups such as the Atlanta chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice to offer resources in multiple languages, including mental health assistance, self-defense training and bystander training. Meanwhile, from Phoenix to Philadelphia, Asian American organizations nationwide organized events aimed at showing unity. Asian Americans United, the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance and several other partner groups held a vigil Wednesday afternoon in Philadelphia’s Chinatown neighborhood. “After the month and year we had, we knew our folks needed the time to come together safely just to grieve and heal and mourn and speak to what’s happening,” said Mohan Seshadri, Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance co-executive director. As much despair as Asian Americans feel, Seshadri said, the shootings also mark a flashpoint. “Our folks are pissed off and ready to fight,” Seshadri said. “The way we get through this is together by organizing our people and feeling solidarity.” Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce CEO Vicente Reid is planning a vigil next week in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, which has a high concentration of Asian American-owned shops and restaurants. He thinks the slayings have galvanized the local community to go beyond vigils. “I think there is this whole outlet of this younger generation who’s passionate and has the energy. They just need someone to step up and lead them,” Reid said. For the past several weeks, Asian Americans have questioned how to deal with a recent wave of assaults — many on the elderly — that have coincided with the pandemic. The virus was first identified in China, and former President Donald Trump and others have used racial terms to describe it. Numerous Asian American organizations say Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened people to express anti-Asian or anti-immigrant views. Nearly 3,800 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner groups, since March 2020. Nationally, women reported hate crimes 2.3 times more than men. Following the release Wednesday of a report showing a surge in white supremacist propaganda in 2020, the Anti-Defamation League told The Associated Press that a significant amount of the propaganda included anti-immigrant rhetoric. The anti-hate group said 10% of propaganda descriptions in its inventory contained negative references to immigration, multiculturalism or diversity. The 522 physical flyers, stickers or banners included the use of words such as “invasion, deport, disease, illegal, infection and virus,” the ADL said. There were also seven propaganda incidents with direct anti-China references to COVID-19. Meanwhile, Asian Americans are thankfully getting support from many non-Asian allies, Mahmood said. “The path forward for us is really just standing together and making sure we don’t let these types of tragedies divide our communities.” ___ Associated Press Writer Aaron Morrison in New York City contributed to this report. ___ Tang reported from Phoenix and is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team.

12,First Korean American Congresswoman Urges People To Call Racist Anti-Asian Violence What It Is,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-Wash.) condemned the mass-shooting deaths of six Asian women in Georgia, saying Wednesday that “racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is.” A day after police arrested a white man, Robert Aaron Long, for shooting and killing eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at three massage spas in Georgia, Strickland spoke from the House floor to give her “deepest condolences” to the families of the victims. “Racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is, and we must stop making excuses or rebranding it as economic anxiety or sexual addiction,” said Strickland, who is the first ever Korean American woman in Congress and the first Black member from Washington. Four of the women killed were reportedly Korean. “As a woman who is Black and Korean I’m acutely aware of how it feels to be erased and ignored,” she said. Strickland noted that the attack was part of a “meteoric rise of violence” against Asian Americans over the past year, and that too often “the default position when violence is committed against people of color or women is to defer from confronting the hate that is often the motivation.” Law enforcement officials said Wednesday that it was “too early” to say whether the shootings were racially motivated and that Long told investigators he has “sexual addiction” issues and targeted the spas to “take out that temptation.” Law enforcement described Tuesday as a “really bad day” — for the shooter. I just spoke out on the House floor condemning yesterday’s brutal shooting in Atlanta in which we lost 8 precious lives, including 6 Asian women. Racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is and we must stop making excuses for it. Watch my remarks here. pic.twitter.com/GwJzwhM8hB Since the start of 2020, Asian Americans have reported a surge in racist attacks and harassment, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community rose by 150% in major U.S. cities last year, per a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. Since last March, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups called Stop AAPI Hate has been collecting reports of racist incidents. By the end of last month, it had recorded an alarming 3,795 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who had been called racial slurs, spat on, physically assaulted and even killed. And women made up two-thirds of those targeted by the reported anti-Asian racism. There is a long, ongoing history of Asian women being fetishized and sexualized in the U.S. and globally — and this intersects directly with racism. This is so gross, I’m struggling to find the words to explain how gross it is he can say this & do this & authorities are going “welp there ya go he’s not racist!” as if this isn’t proof Asian women are sexualized and fetishized to the point of violence against us as sex objects https://t.co/uU84rofuBH It’s a well-known fact that Asian women are fetishized and sexualized daily. A sex addiction doesn’t make it any less targeted or racist here. https://t.co/Zi74LY1cs7 asian women exist at the intersection of sexualized misogyny and racism https://t.co/h3wbawHBrB Addiction and fetishism can absolutely be racial. Identities overlap. Asian American women can experience sexualized racism. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/hWUFK43Gdc As if these things aren't related and based on centuries of sexualized and submissive stereotypes of Asian women. White supremacy is rooted in misogyny and racism. https://t.co/C42KyqTGIP Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Top Democrats In the Dark On Biden Plan To Lift Refugee Admissions,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost Refugees around the world are in the dark on when Joe Biden’s administration will lift the U.S. cap on resettlement admissions ― and congressional Democrats are, too. Asked Tuesday when Biden will make good on his promise to restore refugee admissions, senior Democratic lawmakers said they don’t know when or what the reason is for the delay. “They have consulted with us, talked about the numbers and their dramatic change in the Trump era. But in terms of the actual implementation of that, I don’t know their time table,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leading critic of the Trump administration’s years-long war on refugee admissions, said she has heard “nothing” from the White House about the matter. “I think they ought to put out a public assessment of where they are on these issues because people have different views based on different facts,” Feinstein added of the administration. Nearly a month after announcing the administration’s plans to raise the refugee cap, Biden has yet to formally sign off on the higher cap including 125,000 for the next fiscal year and an additional 62,500 refugees to be admitted this year. Without Biden’s signature on it, refugee admissions are forced to abide by the record low cap set by former president Donald Trump and exclude refugees from several Muslim majority countries. As of March, more than 700 refugees who had been approved and booked to arrive in the U.S. had their flights canceled at the last minute, and more cancellations are expected. “The President is committed to strengthening the operations of the United States Refugee Admissions Program. While no firm numbers have been finalized, the President’s view is clear: This program will reflect the generosity and core values of the United States while benefiting from the many contributions that refugees make to our country,” a White House spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. Asked about the refugee admissions cap, Ambassador Roberta Jacobson, Biden’s coordinator for the southern border, told CNN, “I’m sure we will be acting on that ... but we’re doing so in a deliberate way.” Refugees across the world sold their belongings and traveled for miles to escape perilous conditions in anticipation of boarding their flights only to be told to go back to refugee camps. Families in the U.S. also bought new apartments and furnishings in preparation for the arrivals of their loved ones who haven’t come. Many refugees are operating on expiring medical and security clearances that will likely upend a refugee’s admission to the country if they don’t board a plane on time. The cancellations also reignited severe mental and emotional anguish for families who had their flights canceled several times due to the pandemic and previous legal challenges caused by Trump. “Every day the Biden administration lets this directive stand, it perpetuates the harm caused by former President Trump’s unlawful purpose of excluding Muslims,” said Justin Cox, the senior litigation attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project. “With the stroke of a pen, President Biden could immediately remedy some of the devastating effects the previous administration has had and help Muslim and other refugee families in need of protection.” Biden has faced intensifying criticism ― including from some in his party ― over his handling of the surge of migrant children to the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration recently dispatched the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help care for the growing number of children arriving at the border and opened a large convention center in Dallas to house them. Sensing a political opportunity, dozens of congressional Republicans have traveled to the border to highlight the situation, which they blamed on the Biden administration’s immigration policies. When asked if he thought the border influx was a factor in the delay of restarting refugee admissions, Durbin said, “I don’t know what the logic is behind it.” He added he was eager to hear more from the Homeland Security Department. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another leading refugee advocate, said restarting U.S. admissions will be difficult regardless of when the cap is lifted due to the lack of funding for networks dedicated to the resettlement of families, such as nonprofit organizations and faith-based groups. He said the situation “deserves to be redressed and I’m confident that Congress and the administration will work through this together and we’ll change direction.” But Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who was a refugee in Kenya before she relocated to the United States, urged the Biden administration to do more to help refugees by lifting the cap. I know the difficulties of going through the refugee vetting process and am appalled that we are canceling flights and putting people’s new lives in the US on hold.I am calling on @POTUS to issue a new Presidential Directive immediately.https://t.co/jNeFFT1NHx Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,House Cautiously Tackles Biden’s Immigration Plans Amid Criticism,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Members of the House of Representatives plan to vote on two immigration reform bills this week as a part of President Joe Biden’s sweeping agenda to grant a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people. The bills are Democrats’ first attempts to see what progress, if any, they can make on immigration under Biden as a wave of migrants and asylum-seekers, many of them unaccompanied children, arrive at the border. It has been more than three decades since Congress enacted broad immigration reforms, and anything proposed since then has struggled to gain enough support. Biden’s proposed reforms would be the largest legislative overhaul of the U.S. immigration system since Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Biden’s approach begins with the American Dream and Promise Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for the 2.5 million young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as the 4000,000 immigrants living in the country with temporary protected status. The second bill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, would allow eligible undocumented farmworkers to apply for legal status and is the biggest legalization effort with broad Republican support. Both bills passed the House in 2019 but were never taken up in the then-Republican-led Senate for a vote. Democrats are hoping that by breaking Biden’s immigration plans into several smaller bills, they are more likely to succeed in the Senate. Still, the smaller bills are likely to face roadblocks. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that a comprehensive approach, even with a Democratic majority, “is still a very difficult thing to achieve” and that members of the GOP are likely to prioritize the surge of migrants at the border. “I’m reaching out on the Republican side. Many of them have said they are focused on the southern border, and I think that has to be part of the conversation,” said Durbin. On Monday, a dozen GOP House members, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.), slammed Biden’s approach after visiting a detention center on the U.S.-Mexico border, an event Democrats and immigration activists dismissed as a political stunt. “Their immigration strategy is exactly the same thing as their Covid strategy. Do nothing. Just let people die. P.S. @GOPLeader stop using my community as your prop,” tweeted Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who represents the El Paso district that includes the detention center. The Biden administration also announced on Monday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is stepping in to help manage and care for unaccompanied immigrant children at the border. Meanwhile, on the Hill, the Biden administration faces criticism across the political spectrum. Centrist Democrats are split over the strategy to move forward with a piecemeal legislative approach in order to garner Republic support, while progressives are calling for their moderate colleagues to act decisively and have expressed concern they will accept watered-down immigration bills. Meanwhile, many immigration activists have turned their criticism to the situation at the border and the Biden administration’s detention of unaccompanied migrant children in crowded cells for longer than is legally allowed. More than 4,000 children were being held at Border Patrol stations and facilities as of last weekend. “We have a lot of critics, but many of them are not putting forward a lot of solutions,” said press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday.

15,Homeland Security Chief Defends U.S. Handling Of Border Surge,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a rising number of migrants at the southwest border and criticism from all sides, the Biden administration’s head of Homeland Security insisted Tuesday that the situation is under control as he defended a policy of allowing teens and children crossing by themselves to remain in the country. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas conceded that a surge in the number of children, mostly from Central America, is a challenge for the Border Patrol and other agencies amid the coronavirus pandemic. But he rejected a Trump-era policy of sending them immediately back to Mexico or other countries. “They are vulnerable children and we have ended the prior administration’s practice of expelling them,” Mayorkas said in his most detailed statement yet on a situation at the border that he characterized as “difficult” but not the crisis that critics have portrayed. The increasing number of migrants attempting to cross the border, which is at the highest level since 2019 but is on pace to rise to hit a 20-year peak, has become an early test for President Joe Biden as he seeks to break from his immediate predecessor, President Donald Trump, who waged a broad effort to significantly curtail both legal and illegal immigration. Republicans in Congress have claimed that Biden’s support for immigration legislation and decision to allow people to make legal asylum claims has become a magnet for migrants, but Mayorkas noted that there have been surges in the past, even under Trump. Some progressive Democrats and others, meanwhile, have assailed the Biden administration for holding migrant children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facilities longer than the allowed 72 hours as it struggles to find space in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The number of children crossing by themselves rose 60% from January to more than 9,400 in February, the most recent statistics available. The overall increase is blamed on a number of factors, including the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic in Central America and two recent hurricanes in the region. U.S. officials have also conceded that smugglers have likely encouraged people to try to cross under the new administration. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy led a delegation of a dozen Republican lawmakers on Monday to the border in Texas and blamed the Biden administration for driving an increase in migrants by actions that include supporting legislation in Congress that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people now in the country and halting border wall construction. “The sad part about all of this is it didn’t have to happen. This crisis was created by the presidential policies of this new administration,” McCarthy said. Trump, however, also confronted a similar surge in 2019 even as it rushed to expand the border wall system along the border and forced people seeking asylum to do so in Central America or remain in Mexico. A year earlier he forcibly separated migrant children from their families as part of a zero-tolerance campaign that became one of the most significant political challenges of his administration. After dropping during the start of the pandemic, the number of migrants caught while crossing the border began to rise in April. Some of the increase is due to people who are repeatedly caught after being expelled under the public health order. The total number of people encountered by CBP rose about 28% from January to February to just over 100,000, most of whom were single adults. The last time the number was that high was in June 2019. Migrants who are under 18 years old are being allowed to remain in the country while the government decides whether they have a legal claim to residency, either under asylum law or for some other reason. The U.S. is continuing to expel most single adults and families either to Mexico or to their countries of origin. Mayorkas said exceptions are being made for adults with “certain acute vulnerabilities” that he did not specify or for families when Mexican authorities don’t have capacity in shelters to accept them. Mayorkas noted that 80% of the children, most of whom are from the three Northern Triangle countries of Central America, have a relative in the U.S. and 40% have a parent. The Biden administration last week ended a Trump administration policy that made relatives reluctant to contact HHS to retrieve children for fear of being deported themselves. It has enlisted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up new temporary facilities to house migrant children in Texas and Arizona. It is also working with HHS to expand shelter capacity and backing aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to try to stem the flow of migrants at the source. Mayorkas took swipes at the previous administration for dismantling an asylum system that would have enabled a more “orderly” immigration system, cutting aid to Central America and failing to vaccinate Border Patrol agents. “The situation we are currently facing at the southwest border is a difficult one,” Mayorkas said. “We are tackling it.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Visa Applicants Denied Under Trump's Muslim Travel Ban Can Reapply,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost People who applied for a visa and were denied due to former President Donald Trump’s travel bans on several African and Muslim-majority countries can seek a revised decision or reapply for new ones, the U.S. State Department announced Monday evening. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order and rescinded the Muslim ban, fulfilling his pledge to Muslim and immigrant advocacy groups and allowing families to reunite in the U.S. after years apart. Biden then asked the State Department to come up with a plan to address the backlog of visa denials the ban had created. Applicants who were denied due to the ban on or after Jan. 20, 2020, “may seek re-adjudication without resubmitting their application forms or paying any additional fees, provided the underlying visa petitions remain valid,” according to an announcement on the State Department website. Immigrant visa applications that were denied prior to Jan. 20, 2020, may also be reconsidered, but these applicants are required to submit new applications and pay a new application fee. An applicant’s previous denial would not negatively affect their new applications. Diversity visa applicants who were not issued visas because of the ban between fiscal years 2017 and 2020 will not be able to receive new visas, according to the legal review. “We have to remember, first and foremost, these are individuals and families who were forced to remain separated from their loved ones, missing milestones, holidays, and every piece of what it means to be separated from your family,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of the nonprofit Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. “The least we can do is offer an opportunity for re-adjudication without prejudice, and streamline the application process.” There are challenges, however. Restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are likely to slow down the process. In January 2020, there were about 75,000 immigrant visa cases pending at the National Visa Center ready for interviews. Thirteen months later, in February 2021, there were 473,000 ― more than six times as many. “People who are denied entry under the Muslim ban will have to request re-adjudication and basically get in the back of the line,” Vignarajah said. “That is almost half a million people long. So, this is a steep uphill battle.” In one of his first moves as president, Trump issued an executive order limiting entry for people from seven Muslim-majority nations in January 2017, a follow-up to his campaign promise of “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Over the course of his presidency, the ban was challenged in courts, revised, ultimately upheld, and expanded. In February 2020, Trump added several African countries to the list, a move that Democrats and immigration advocates characterized as racist. The effects of the ban were swift and destructive. More than 42,000 people tried to come to the U.S. and were barred under the ban, according to a 2019 analysis of State Department data by the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. For years, families have been split apart, married couples were unable to reunite and parents missed the births of their children. Students could not attend college and people could not receive medical treatment in the U.S. One study found that women from countries included in the travel ban were more likely to give birth prematurely. After Biden revoked the ban, families and advocates celebrated, hopeful they would be able to reunite with loved ones under a new administration. In February, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) reintroduced the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants (NO BAN) Act, originally designed to end the Muslim ban, in an effort to prevent future presidents from implementing similar travel bans on the basis of religion. “We cannot risk letting prejudice become policy again,” Chu said last month. “That is why I am once again introducing the NO BAN Act to update our laws. By requiring actual evidence of a threat before there can be any such broad-based bans like this, the NO BAN Act ensures that future presidents will not be able to ban people solely because of their religion.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee To Honor 4 Civil Rights Icons,social-justice," Black Voices Editor, HuffPost This weekend marks the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the peaceful march of more than 500 demonstrators who walked from Selma to Montgomery across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met with brutal violence by Alabama state troopers on March 7, 1965. For over a decade, the Bridge Crossing Jubilee has recognized this day and the fight for voting rights with a weekend-long commemoration and a march across the bridge. The event normally brings out 50,000 people each year. This year is very different, however. In 2020, four civil rights icons died: Congressman John Lewis, who helped lead the march, Southern Christian Leadership Conference founder Joseph Lowery, minister and Martin Luther King Jr. confidant C.T. Vivian and attorney Bruce Boynton. This year’s celebration, which is virtual due to COVID-19, will honor them. Drew Glover, who is the coordinator of this year’s Selma Jubilee, told HuffPost that it was significant to still find a way to host the event and honor the civil rights giants, despite the pandemic. “The very real significance that it plays not only in the importance of commemorating the work of Congressman Lewis and the other great civil rights leaders, I think one of the main goals and roles that the Jubilee plays is this annual commemoration and reminder of the struggles that people had to experience to be able to allow us the right to vote,” he said. Bloody Sunday was a major turning point in the civil rights movement. In Dallas County, Alabama, Black people made up more than half of the population but accounted for a mere 2% of registered voters. Activists, including Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee co-founder Bernard Lafayette, went down to Selma to register Black voters and fight for equal voting rights. When Lewis, alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Hosea Williams, led the marchers to the bridge 56 years ago, they were met by more than 100 state troopers and deputies, some on horseback, others waving Confederate flags. When Maj. John Cloud told them to end their peaceful protest, Williams asked to have a word with him. He refused. The protesters stood their ground and marched on. Officials clubbed, tear-gassed and beat them, some nearly to death. Dozens, including Lewis, were injured. At least 17 were hospitalized. The violence was broadcast across the country and brought attention to the brutality Black people in the South were facing and became the catalyst for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lafayette, now 80, was 22 when he went down to fight for voting rights in Selma, a year after he had been brutally beaten during the Freedom Rides. “No matter what happens to you, you must continue the struggle. And the reason we were able to bring about change is because we could continue to struggle. We did that stop on the bridge. We crossed the bridge, did that stop on the bridge,” Lafeyette told HuffPost of the courage it took to be a foot soldier in the movement. Though he was not at the bridge on Bloody Sunday, Lafayette worked tirelessly in the Selma marches during 1965. He helped recruit Chicago gang members to marshal the protests. He said their nonviolent strategies made progress, but the fight continues. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act that prevented states from approving discriminatory voting practices. For nearly a decade, marginalized groups’ voting rights have been under attack. “I think we must appreciate the fact that the battle is not over while we have accomplished some things. We’ve also had some setbacks,” Lafayette said. “We could not have anticipated that the Voting Rights Act would be under attack.” Glover said today’s voter suppression, police brutality and systemic oppression are akin to what activists were fighting against in 1965. “One of the main reasons we felt it was still important to have the event this year, even transitioning it virtually because of the pandemic, is the urgency of making sure that this history and kind of chronicled experience of these individuals, that were up against all the odds and used nonviolent social change tactics to make an impact, it’s important that we lift up that history and incorporate it into the conversation across generations,” Glover said. This year’s events began Friday and end Sunday. The theme this year is “Beyond the Bridge: People Power, Political Power, Economic Power” and it will include panels, a symposium for social change, workshops on effective organizing, virtual concerts and a Sunday morning church service with a drive across the bridge and then the laying of a wreath. Folks at home will be able to participate with a virtual bridge crossing presentation. Throughout the weekend, organizers, activists and other attendees will honor the lives and memory of Lewis, Vivian, Lowery and Boynton. Tafeni L. English, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Civil Rights Memorial Center, said it shouldn’t be lost on participants that the same voting rights those hundreds of protesters fought for in 1965 are at stake today. “I love that the Jubilee this year is being very intentional in the language of hosting this event in the spirit of John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, Bruce Boynton and so many others,” she told HuffPost. “And I think what is really key is because, even after the victories won in the Deep South with regard to mobilizing voters, at the core of that, we’re still seeing where there has been an introduction of the bills that have been introduced that are aimed at creating more barriers to voting. Suppressing the right to vote.” Lafayette, who was also Lewis’s former roommate, said that it is important for today’s activists to implement strategy and be organized. He tipped his hat to the women leading the movement today, noting that more Black women stepping forth as leaders is a needed thing. (“You ain’t gonna find a better organizer than women,” he said.) Lafayette said that the best way people can honor the legacies of Lewis, Vivian, Lowery, Boynton and other activists who are no longer living is to make sure the work that has been done stays in place. He also said that he believes the bridge, which is still named after a Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader, should be renamed for Lewis, an effort that The John Lewis Bridge Project and others have been working toward. English recalled 2020’s bridge crossing, which was Lewis’s final crossing. She said they didn’t open the Civil Rights Memorial Center often but made an exception for Lewis and others to walk in this time. She said his words left an indelible mark on her. “I’ll never forget what he said was, ‘It is so important that we continue to show up because we never know when it will be our last time.’” Black Voices Editor, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Civil Rights Activist And Lawyer Vernon Jordan Dies,social-justice," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vernon Jordan, who grew up in the segregated South to become an influential leader in the American civil rights movement, Washington politics and Wall Street, has died at age 85, his daughter said on Tuesday. Jordan, who in 1980 was badly wounded by a white supremacist sniper in Indiana, died on Monday night peacefully and “surrounded by loved ones,” daughter Vickee Jordan said in a statement. His role as a Washington insider took him all the way to the White House, where he was a close friend, golfing buddy and adviser to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jordan never held a formal government job, but no one knew better than Jordan how favors, access and requests worked in Washington. In a statement, Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, called him a “wonderful friend,” adding, “Vernon Jordan brought his big brain and strong heart to everything and everybody he touched.” Clinton mentioned Jordan’s instrumental role in desegregating the University of Georgia in 1961, his career in law and business, and his work with civil rights groups. Jordan grew up in a housing project in Atlanta before his family bought a home and he was the only Black person in his class at DePauw University in rural Greencastle, Indiana. After graduating, Jordan earned a law degree from Howard University and returned to Atlanta to work for a civil rights attorney. Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia at a time of racial segregation in Southern states. Jordan helped escort his two young Black clients past jeering protesters on their first day of class. Jordan later went to work for the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund before becoming head of the National Urban League in 1971. He worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Akin Gump international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard financial management firm in New York. “To the world, Vernon was a towering civil rights figure, a confidant to presidents, and a counselor to CEOs and governments around the globe. And he was all of those things. But to those of us at Akin Gump, Vernon was also a wise and trusted mentor and friend,” the firm said in a statement. “His achievements were doubly remarkable considering the obstacles he overcame as a Black man rising from the virulent racism of America’s segregated Deep South. Vernon burned brighter than the rest of us, with a vitality amplified by his imposing frame and resonant voice,” Lazard Chairman and CEO Kenneth Jacobs wrote in a memo to employees. After gains in voting rights and equal access laws, Jordan’s approach was to push for greater economic opportunities for Black people, even in corporate boardrooms. At an Urban League event Jordan said he told the organization’s corporate benefactors, “Don’t just give us money and don’t just show up for the Equal Opportunity Day dinner. That is not enough when you look at Black consumer power in this country. It’s not enough for you to come and shake our hands and be our friends. We want in.” Under his leadership, the Urban League began issuing its annual State of Black America reports to assess the social and economic status of Black Americans. U.S. companies such as American Express, Xerox, Dow Jones, Bankers Trust, RJR Nabisco, Revlon and Sara Lee put him on their boards, where he was often the only Black member. Jordan was close to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, and Carter reportedly offered him cabinet jobs. Jordan would eventually become critical of Carter, saying he had not delivered on his economic promises to Blacks. In 1980, Jordan was badly wounded as he exited the car of a white woman who was an Urban League member in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Joseph Paul Franklin, a former Ku Klux Klansman and member of the American Nazi Party who was convicted of a series of race-related murders, admitted to the ambush but was acquitted. He told authorities he hated interracial couples. After 10 years at the Urban League, Jordan wanted something different and joined Akin Gump. Tall and imposing, he earned a reputation for being a charming and persuasive “Washington wise man.” After Clinton was elected president in 1992, he chose Jordan, whom he had known since the early 1970s, to head his transition team. In 2008 when Barack Obama was running to be the first Black president, Jordan stuck by his longtime friends and supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s nomination. According to the Financial Times, Jordan told Obama, “I am too old to trade friendship for race.” Jordan’s first wife, Shirley Jordan, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985. They had one child. In 1986 he married Ann Dibble. Additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Will Dunham; Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky"
11,Biden Says Texas Facility For Unaccompanied Migrants 'Won't Stay Open Very Long',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden addressed his administration’s controversial decision to reopen a Texas facility designed to hold unaccompanied migrant minors during a Univision interview on Friday. The facility, located in Carrizo Springs, was opened by the Trump administration to house 700 teenagers aged 13 to 17 and closed only a month later in the summer of 2019. Biden’s team has said that its reopening is a temporary measure designed to cope with increased numbers of migrant children crossing the U.S. and Mexico border, as well as COVID-19 closing other facilities for minors. “Right now there’s thousands of unaccompanied children coming across the border,” Biden told Univision’s Ilia Calderon. “We’ve been able to place a significant number of them in licensed facilities throughout the country ... In Texas, they opened up one ... used in the last administration. Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely to be housed in a facility that’s licensed.” First lady Jill Biden, who was also present during the interview, echoed her husband’s remarks and said that the Biden administration’s priorities were to house migrant children, offer them mental health and legal services and reunite them with family members in a “humane way.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki conveyed a similar message during a Thursday appearance on “The View.” Psaki defended the reopening, arguing that temporarily housing unaccompanied children in a revamped facility was significantly different from family separation at the border, which was a common practice during the Trump era. Nevertheless, the decision has garnered criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortz (D-N.Y.) calling it unacceptable “no matter the administration or party,” and arguing that the entire U.S. immigration system is “built on a carceral framework.” Former Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, meanwhile, argued that Biden’s immigration policies were “cruel” during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday, despite the fact that he was a major proponent of family separation during his time in the White House.

12,"Democrats Urge Biden Administration To Track Race, Ethnicity In Vaccinations",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to release data on the race and ethnicity of people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to ensure equitable distribution. In a letter to the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday, 10 senators wrote that it is “critical” that federal databases track “robust demographic information to ensure at-risk communities are being vaccinated appropriately.” “Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities have been disproportionately harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and yet, they are being vaccinated at significantly lower rates,” wrote the senators, including Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). The lawmakers noted that data on vaccination by race and ethnicity would help health officials ensure that vaccines are being distributed equitably and to work to overcome barriers to access. The CDC reports that so far, over 47 million people in the U.S. have gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. While the agency released a report in early February on race and ethnicity in the first month of vaccinations, it is not publicly reporting such demographics on an ongoing basis, even as the rate of vaccination has sped up and eligibility has expanded in recent weeks. In the CDC’s February report, looking at the first 12 million people vaccinated — mainly health workers and long-term care residents — only half reported their race or ethnicity, and disparities were evident: Only 11.5% of those vaccinated were Latinx (the U.S. is 19% Latinx) and 5.4% were Black (the U.S. is 13% Black). Meanwhile, Black and Latinx people across the nation have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. They are three times as likely to be hospitalized as whites, and twice as likely to die. The White House and CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some states have been tracking their vaccinations by race and ethnicity, and initial data has been alarming. California, for instance, which recently began publicly reporting these demographics, says that only 3% of people who have received vaccines in the state are Black (Black people make up 7% of the state population) and only 17% are Latinx (Latinx people make up 39% of California residents). Earlier this week, President Joe Biden acknowledged in a roundtable with Black essential workers that due to systemic racism in health care, some communities have been more hesitant to get the vaccine. In their letter on Friday, the lawmakers noted that vaccine data by race and ethnicity would help public officials not only with equitable distribution but also with identifying barriers to access and determining where there might be vaccine hesitancy, in order to work to address that. Early last year, as the coronavirus was spreading, the CDC only began releasing data on the race and ethnicity of people the virus had infected or killed after a similar push by Democratic lawmakers.

13,No Charges Against Officers Involved In Daniel Prude’s Death,social-justice," Police officers shown on body camera video holding Daniel Prude down naked and handcuffed on a city street last winter until he stopped breathing will not face criminal charges, according to a grand jury decision announced Tuesday. The 41-year-old Black man’s death last March sparked nightly protests in Rochester, New York, after the video was released nearly six months later, with demonstrators demanding a reckoning for police and city officials. State Attorney General Letitia James, whose office took over the prosecution and impaneled a grand jury, said “the criminal justice system is badly in need of reform.” “While I know that the Prude family, the Rochester community, and communities across the country will rightfully be devastated and disappointed, we have to respect this decision,” James said in a prepared release. “Serious reform is needed, not only at the Rochester Police Department, but to our criminal justice system as a whole.” Lawyers for the seven police officers suspended over Prude’s death have said the officers were strictly following their training that night, employing a restraining technique known as “segmenting.” They claimed Prude’s use of PCP, which caused irrational behavior, was “the root cause” of his death. The video made public on Sept. 4 shows Prude handcuffed and naked with a spit hood over his head as an officer pushes his face against the ground, while another officer presses a knee to his back. The officers held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He was taken off life support a week later. The county medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint” and cited PCP as a contributing factor. Prude’s family filed a federal lawsuit alleging the police department sought to cover up the true nature of his death. Officers Troy Taladay, Paul Ricotta, Francisco Santiago, Andrew Specksgoor, Josiah Harris and Mark Vaughn, along with Sgt. Michael Magri, were suspended after Prude’s death became public. Democratic Mayor Lovely Warren fired police chief La’Ron Singletary shortly after the video’s release, while rejecting calls from demonstrators that she resign. Singletary has said in legal papers that Warren told him to lie to support her assertion that she hadn’t learned of Prude’s death until months later, and fired him for his refusal to do so. A city spokesperson said his version of events confirms Warren never saw the video until August. Warren announced a run for a third term in January and pleaded not guilty in October to an unrelated indictment alleging she broke campaign finance rules and committed fraud. The city’s public integrity office found no ethical lapses by the mayor in a narrow review of Prude’s death. The city halted its investigation into Prude’s death when James’ office began its own investigation in April. Under New York law, deaths of unarmed people in police custody are typically turned over to the attorney general’s office, rather than handled by local officials."

15,"Biden, Democrats To Unveil Immigration Bill With Faster Pathway To Citizenship",social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration is joining Democrats on Capitol Hill to unveil a major immigration overhaul that would offer an eight-year pathway to citizenship to the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status. The legislation, to be released in detail Thursday morning, will reflect the broad priorities for immigration reform that Biden laid out on his first day in office, including an increase in visas, funding to process asylum applications and new technology at the southern border. But while the plan offers one of the fastest pathways to citizenship of any proposed measure in recent years, it does so without offering any enhanced border security, which past immigration negotiations have used as a way to win Republican votes. Without enhanced security, it faces tough odds in a closely divided Congress. The bill would immediately provide green cards to farm workers, those with temporary protected status and young people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. For others living in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, the plan establishes a five-year path to temporary legal status, if they pass background checks, pay taxes and fulfill other basic requirements. Then, after three years, they can pursue citizenship. The plan would raise the current per-country caps for family and employment-based immigrant visas. It would eliminate the penalty barring those immigrants who live in the U.S. without authorization and who then leave the country from returning for three to 10 years. It also would provide resources for more judges, support staff and technology to address the backlog in processing asylum seekers. The bill would expand transnational anti-drug task forces in Central America and enhances technology at the border. And it would try to reduce the burden at the border by setting up refugee processing in Central America, to try to prevent some of the immigrant caravans that have overwhelmed border security in recent years. The plan includes $4 billion spread over four years to try to boost economic development and tackle corruption in Latin American countries, to try to address some of the root causes of migration to the U.S. A dozen Democratic lawmakers, including lead sponsors California Rep. Linda Sanchez and New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, are set to unveil the full text of the bill. Comprehensive immigration reform has struggled to gain traction in Congress for decades. Menendez was part of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators who negotiated a 2013 immigration reform bill that ultimately collapsed. Prior to that, a bill backed by President George W. Bush failed in Congress as well, after multiple attempts at compromise. While Biden is pushing a comprehensive bill, he suggested earlier this week he may be open to a more piecemeal approach. During a CNN town hall Tuesday night, Biden said that while a pathway to citizenship would be essential in any immigration bill, “there’s things I would deal by itself.” That could leave the door open to standalone bills focused on providing a pathway to citizenship for various populations. Still, publicly the White House is emphasizing that its goal is a comprehensive plan. “The president feels that all of these requirements that are in the bill — these components of the bill — are what makes it comprehensive,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. “They all need to be addressed. That’s why he proposed them together.”"

0,'We Need Help To Feel Safe In Our Country': Olivia Munn Condemns Anti-Asian Violence,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Olivia Munn, whose mother is of Chinese descent, condemned violence against Asian Americans in a series of social media posts on Wednesday and Thursday. The actor, known for her roles in HBO’s “The Newsroom” and films like “X-Men: Apocalypse,” wrote that she felt at a loss for words after hearing about recent anti-Asian hate crimes, including the death of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee, a Thai American man who was slammed to the ground in San Francisco last month in an apparently unprovoked attack. “To simply exist as a minority in this country is seen as a protest to some,” Munn wrote in a post shared to her Instagram and Twitter accounts. “We need help amplifying the outrage. We need help to feel safe in our country. We need help to be safe in our country.” A post shared by L i v (@oliviamunn) On her Twitter account, Munn also posted a quote from journalist David Yi, who is of Korean descent and has publicly called for Asian Americans to speak out against racism. #StopAsianHateCrimes #StopAAPIHate #ProtectOurElders🙏🏼💛 pic.twitter.com/LRaG6mDkk3 Munn has previously discussed her own struggles to break into the entertainment industry, including casting companies telling her she was “too white” to play Asian roles and “too Asian” to play white roles. She joins a host of other celebrities, including actors Daniel Dae Kim, Daniel Wu and Gemma Chan, in addressing recent violence against Asian Americans. Kim and Wu even offered a $25,000 reward to anyone with information leading to an arrest in the case of a 91-year-old man who was pushed to the ground in Oakland, California’s Chinatown earlier this month. A suspect has since been arrested. Harassment of Asian Americans surged following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, as then-President Donald Trump insisted on using the terms “China virus” and “Kung flu.” According to a report issued in early 2020, a group of Asian American organizations received nearly 1,500 reports of anti-Asian discrimination just between mid-March and mid-April of last year. By the end of 2020, the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate had collected 2,808 reports of Asian American harassment across the United States. Reporter, HuffPost"
1,More Men Helped Around The House Because Of COVID-19. What Went Wrong?,social-justice," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Article after article tells us that moms across America are utterly exhausted. Some have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, others are trying to balance work and supervising kids doing remote learning. Most are doing it with little to no support. But men were chipping in when it came to housework and child care tasks ― at least in the first wave of the lockdown, according to a new study. “Our findings based on data from very early in the pandemic show that if fathers are in the home more and work allows them to be flexible, they are more likely to be able to step up to the kinds of demands that families have,” said Melissa Milkie, the lead author of the study and a sociology professor at the University of Toronto Mississauga. Milkie and her team conducted the study last May in the midst of the first wave of coronavirus-related lockdowns. Their research took into account the responses of 1,234 male-female couples across Canada with at least one child. (It’s worth noting that Canada offers far more parental support to its citizens.) Both men and women reported that dads were stepping up. The biggest gains appeared in organizing and planning children’s activities: Before the outbreak, 46% of respondents said this was an equally shared task or that fathers did more than mothers. Afterward, 57% said this was the case. Respondents reported smaller increases in fathers monitoring kids at school, reading, talking and listening to them, and physical care. But somewhere along the line, things changed. As your exhausted working mom friends have probably told you, far too many men seem to have stepped back and let their wives again take on the lion’s share of the parenting and household responsibilities. According to a McKinsey poll conducted with LeanIn.Org, since the pandemic began, mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to shoulder the majority of household and parenting labor. And they’re 1.5 times more likely than dads to spend an extra three or more hours on chores and child care. Single mothers, of course, have it even harder. As the McKinsey report notes, working women have always endured a “second shift” at home: The expectation is that they go to work, then take up the housework and child care in the evenings. “Now the supports that made this possible ― including school and child care ― have been upended by the pandemic,” the researchers write. What made fathers show up in such a big way during the first lockdown, then step back? “In the first wave of the lockdown, fathers stepped up some ― showing they will get involved when conditions are just right,” Milkie told HuffPost. “But other structures and inequalities made this not sustainable in terms of more sharing,” she explained. “Structurally, mothers were more often in precarious, low-paid jobs, and very powerful cultural forces pressure mothers to ‘choose’ to reduce their work when stressors are overloading a family.” “I know fatigue has set in for almost everyone regarding COVID, but for many guys, there’s a regular pattern that has nothing to do with COVID.” More than 2 million women have left the workforce from the winter of 2019 through this fall, either due to decreased hours at work or to facilitate remote learning at home with their kids. That’s an incredibly worrisome trend. According to a report by the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress, “even a 5 percent decline” in mothers’ economic participation “would undo the past 25 years of progress.” Milkie admits her optimism about a more balanced domestic division of labor is tempered by these recent trends. “I do think that in cases where mothers reduced their paid work or are no longer employed, parents have likely gone back to specialized, more traditional gender roles,” she said. “And of course, for single moms, and those with fewer economic resources, the pandemic has hit especially hard ― they are doing an incredible amount of work to manage raising kids in a pandemic.” As Milkie sees it, after the first wave of the lockdown, government policies, workplaces and structures all failed working mothers. “They failed in a lack of direct relief to families during the pandemic, including a focus on keeping schools and child care safely open,” she said. “They failed in the lack of existing infrastructure of quality, year-round care for children. Failed in a lack of paid parental leave for all workers. Failed through the structure of a labor market that disadvantages women, especially those with the fewest resources. And failed in workplaces that promote overwork and inflexibility.” Marriage therapists say they’ve heard plenty of stories about dads who’ve slowly backed away from household chores and Zoom class supervision duties ― even the ones who were on top of it all at the beginning of the pandemic. “One client is staying home one day a week so his wife can go to her workplace, but he continues to make excuses that he’s just not good with kids and often creates more headaches for her when she gets home, so she says the benefit is a wash,” said Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, who primarily works with men. It’s almost universally acknowledged that even in 2021, tired gender expectations about housework die hard. A Gallup study from last year, before the pandemic hit, showed that even among egalitarian-minded millennial couples, it’s gender ― rather than, say, the earning power of individuals ― that shapes the division of household labor. Many new dads fall back into their fathers’ and grandfathers’ ideas about the division of labor, Smith said, like taking care of the outside of the house while expecting their partner to handle the inside. But in the midst of a global pandemic, men’s partners need considerably more from them. “I know fatigue has set in for almost everyone regarding COVID, but for many guys, there’s a regular pattern that has nothing to do with COVID,” Smith said. “It’s a pattern of stepping up for a period, falling back into old habits, then stepping up again when the relationship gets too uncomfortable.” Smith said the pre-pandemic complaints he heard about lack of consistency or reliability haven’t waned as the coronavirus continues. Sarah Spencer Northey, a marriage therapist in Washington, D.C., said that initially, many of her millennial parent clients did say that dads were stepping up in a big way. The wives were thrilled about it. “Most of my clients, who are around my age, place a strong value on achieving gender equality, so if there is a clear way to achieve that, such as a shake-up like working from home more, they jump on it,” she said. But Northey said the majority of the couples eventually ran into a big hurdle: In spite of valuing gender equality in all areas of their lives, most struggled to make it happen at home since so few people have received any sort of training or modeling on how to do so. “Most people would understand why someone might freak out over cheating or a pattern of hurtful detachment. We need to lean in to calling out toxic patterns of unequal labor as well.” Without seeing it modeled by your own parents, achieving gender parity in housework and emotional labor is pretty much a pipe dream. (Even with that model, though, it’s easy to slide into old gender roles; culturally, we put a premium on men’s work while undervaluing women’s. Plus, paid leave and child care options in the U.S. are abysmal.) “It’s like our parents’ generation gave us this nice idea [on household labor], but we didn’t get sufficient guidance to put it into action,” Northey said. “It’s kind of like placing a strong value on being able to play an instrument, but then having very limited instruction on how to actually play it and being sent to perform on a concert stage.” Hence the backsliding and bumbling we’re seeing now, Northey said. “My hope for the next generation is that they will get to have both: the value and the training, with much better attempts at modeling equality around the house,” the therapist said. Reverting to old patterns is a natural and expected part of making a deeper change, but it’s certainly not helpful in times like these. Elisabeth LaMotte, therapist and founder of the DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center, told HuffPost the best way to reengage a slacking partner is to simply remind them of how helpful they were early on in the pandemic ― during the chaotic but we’re-all-in-this-together stage of this mess. If you’re unsure of what to say, LaMotte said to script it out like this: “Do you remember back in the spring when all of this felt so scary and new? I realize that I felt like more of a team back then and the steps that you took around the house made a big difference. I’d like to try to get back to that place together. Do you think that we could work on that? For example, if you could take over the meal planning, clean up after dinner each night and take care of the laundry, it would go a long way to helping me feel like we’re in this together.” However you broach it, don’t feel guilty or assume you’re overreacting by asking your co-parent to actually parent. “We need to support demanding equality around the house in the same way we would support demanding anything else super important to a relationship such as trust or affection,” Northey said. To put it bluntly, the marriage therapist said it’s probably time we make gender inequality a dealbreaker in relationships. “The inequality needs to be seen as more than just a problem for a partner to endure patiently and compassionately alone,” she said. “I’m not trying to break up homes with this suggestion, just break the cycle.” If anything, Northey thinks it will benefit a marriage to talk about this kind of stuff in a direct, unequivocal manner. “I actually have faith that partners will step it up once we take this problem more seriously,” she said. “We can stop enabling the inequality by taking more seriously how pernicious it can become. Most people would understand why someone might freak out over cheating or a pattern of hurtful detachment. We need to lean in to calling out toxic patterns of unequal labor as well.” Of course, a transparent, no-holds-barred conversation with your partner isn’t a solve-all here (though it will certainly help). For working parents to have a genuinely healthy work-life balance, employers need to be a little more conscious of what their employees are going through. Just like working dads, bosses and managers need to let go of their traditionalist gender expectations about who goes to work and who stays home, Northey said. Not every employed dad has a wife at home who can supply free labor. But men also have an obligation to speak up to their employers about their need for a better work-life balance ― just as working mothers have done since time immemorial. “Historically, many women didn’t have a choice but to tell their employers they had schedule or time limitations due to family obligations,” Northey said. “This puts them in vulnerable positions [because they were] being perceived as less dedicated to their careers, but also made them more comfortable and better trained in speaking up about it.” If working parents are going to get through this pandemic with their sanity intact, it’s going to take effort from both employers and working dads. “The reality is, men need to start being more vocal, and more employers need to be proactive in making their scheduling leave policies truly equal,” Northey said.

2,I Spent 5 Days At The Largest Migrant Refugee Camp On The U.S. Border. Here's What I Saw.,social-justice," Guest Writer One of the last things I did before the world went into COVID-19 lockdown last year was witness a refugee camp with my own eyes. At the time, this camp held some 3,000 people, most of them families, women and young children, all cramped together on what used to be a small public park, cooking from stoves made of dried mud, sleeping on the ground in camping tents or yurt-like structures of tarpaulin and other scrap materials. A year later, this refugee camp still exists. No, it’s not near Syria or South Sudan. It’s just south of Brownsville, Texas, a stone’s throw across the Rio Grande in Matamoros, Mexico. The Matamoros Refugee Camp is an example of the lingering damage left from the Trump administration’s euphemistically named Migrant Protection Protocols (aka MPP or “Remain in Mexico”). For the last two years, MPP combined with closing the border due to COVID-19 has trapped tens of thousands of vulnerable asylum-seekers in Mexico, creating the first refugee camps along a U.S. border ever. The largest of these camps is in Matamoros, containing hundreds of men, women and children, most of them fleeing extreme violence and poverty in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. As recently as Feb. 2, President Joe Biden issued an executive order for the Department of Homeland Security to “promptly review” MPP. However, the review will likely take months, and the order doesn’t detail what to do with these people in refugee camps who applied for asylum under the previous administration. The result is an immigration limbo with some of these migrants waiting for a year and a half while their cases stall in court. This time last year, I knew very little about all of this. I’d never set foot in a refugee camp. I’d never even been to Mexico. I wanted to see the border situation firsthand for a book I’m writing about the American detention-deportation machine, which has grown into an “industry” akin to for-profit incarceration. Online, I connected with a group of immigration activists known as Witness at the Border. This network of volunteers, who come from all across the country “to Witness,” had gained national attention for their social media posts about immigrant detention as well as for their efforts maintaining vigils in front of migrant “detention centers” or “shelters,” really prisons for immigrants. Last February, the “Witnesses” were still taking people across the Brownsville & Matamoros Express International Bridge to experience firsthand the stark reality of the refugee camp there, which at the time had swollen to nearly 3,000 individuals. When I arrived in Brownsville, I was guided across the border by the founder of the Witness movement, Joshua Rubin. A retired software engineer from Brooklyn, Rubin felt compelled by news of family separations at the border to do something proactive. So back in 2018, he began a lonely vigil outside a migrant detention center in Tornillo, Texas. Slowly, other activists and people from across the country (including some big names like Alyssa Milano and Beto O’Rourke) joined Rubin, and a few months later that site closed down. In 2019, Witness at the Border and other activist groups had similar success with a minor migrant detention site in Homestead, Florida. “This vigil has proven to be extremely useful,” said Rubin about his time at the border, where Witnesses also documented “deportation flights” regularly running out of the Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport. “We don’t know if we’re going to accomplish anything exactly, but we know we have a chance. We’re watching, and they know we’re watching. Before this, they didn’t feel it.” Exiting the terminals on the Mexican side, it was impossible to miss the refugee camp. Looking across the highway, it was the first thing I saw, a grassy levee dotted with tents behind chain-link fencing that was covered in drying clothes and topped in barbed wire. At the time, there were no guards or security in front of the camp ― you could walk through unchecked and see what had become a small city of several thousand people from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and a growing number from within Mexico itself. All were refugees, people who’d “done it the right way,” applied for asylum at a legal port of entry just like they were supposed to. However, Trump’s MPP had forced them to “Remain in Mexico” while the pandemic shut down the tent immigration courts that were set up, visible even, just across the river. I almost couldn’t believe the living conditions inside the camp. Women did their laundry in the same bend of river where many migrants had drowned trying to swim across.By the Matamoros banks, men daily chopped mesquite to burn in earthen stoves for their meals. Throughout the dirt alleys of the tent city, children ran about in rags with no shoes. These weren’t “rapists” or “murderers” or “animals” as Donald Trump had called them. They were just people, most of them families looking for a better life. I spoke with people who’d been living there for months. I couldn’t believe the stories I heard about what they called “Cartels” in Mexico and “La Mara” in Central America: stories of theft, extortion, rape, kidnapping, murder, mutilation and torture. Like a lot of other Witnesses, during my five days in Brownsville, I volunteered with different nonprofits. I watched young children do colorful drawings as part of Team Brownsville’s Escuelita de la Banqueta (“Little Sidewalk School”) and helped a San Antonio-based organization called Sueños Sin Fronteras (“Dreams Without Borders”) deliver water filters, hydration packets and other supplies to a resource center near the camp. It was a strange new feeling having some small but direct impact in a community, an impact I could see with my own eyes. These people needed this assistance. Still, I couldn’t help but be impressed by the refugees’ resilience and ingenuity. Even in this hostile environment, people had found ways to maintain their dignity, culture and identity. While visiting the camp, I heard about a recent quinceañera (a kind of “sweet 15”), the camp’s first, and I also got lunch at a “restaurant,” a tin shack that served fresh pupusas, plantains and coffee. In truth, however, the relative calm of the site belied a much darker history. One 47-year-old man I spoke with had lived in Brownsville since he was 3 months old. He’d been recently deported and said he was now living between the streets and the camp; he didn’t seem to speak or understand much Spanish. I also spoke with a Salvadoran mother of two who told me in San Miguel she’d been paying 300 colones a week (about $34) to police officers under threat of death. When the price went up, she fled with her whole family. As horrible as these stories are, they are sadly far too common. Life in the refugee camp was by no means free of risk either. Migrants in Matamoros told me repeatedly about assaults, kidnappings and robberies, mostly from gang members or corrupt police. One mother was even forced to send her daughter across the bridge alone because she was being raped in the camp. (Under MPP, unaccompanied minors were still accepted into the U.S., while families had to wait out their asylum claims in Mexico.) Over time, these dangers have driven thousands from the border refugee camps to seek shelter elsewhere, even in the streets, or to give up on their asylum claims altogether. To date, there are about 1,000 people remaining in the Matamoros Refugee Camp and thousands more scattered in smaller encampments all along the southern border. Some estimates put the backlog of asylum claims ― those waiting in Mexico for their cases to be heard ― as high as 60,000. Although Biden has sworn to undo the previous administration’s damage to the nation’s immigration system, including issuing a host of executive orders, many immigration activists, myself included, feel that the new president is not moving swiftly or aggressively enough. A federal judge in Texas halted Biden’s deportation moratorium after just one week, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues its rapid rate of deportations, even sending people to countries they’ve never been to, such as with Paul Pierrilus who was recently deported to Haiti, the birth country of his parents. Meanwhile, for those waiting in refugee camps, nothing has changed. Migrants requesting asylum at legal ports of entry are still being turned away. Since I went to Brownsville, I’ve stayed in contact with a couple of asylum-seekers. “The only thing we’ve been told is that things will change and that la migra [immigration authorities] will change a little their mistreatment of migrants,” said Josué, a Honduran who stays with his family in the Matamoros camp. Josué told me his court date was also recently changed: to July 27. “By that time, I will have been here two years,” he said. “But we continue, with God’s help.” It’s not as if Biden isn’t aware that these refugees are suffering as they wait. Dr. Jill Biden, who’s now the first lady, visited the Matamoros Refugee Camp in 2019 with Team Brownsville, a nonprofit that provides aid and supplies to migrants. At the time, she said what she saw in the camp was “heartbreaking.” I know there are a million considerations with any undertaking in today’s political trench warfare. But when it comes to these people on the other side of the border, on the banks of what’s called in Mexico the Rio Bravo (the “Wild River”), it’s not a matter of political calculation. It’s a matter of doing the right thing ― and doing it swiftly. These people have waited long enough. If they don’t qualify as refugees or asylum-seekers ― having fled chaos and murder and waited for months and months ― then who does? What I saw in Matamoros has never left me. Of course, I didn’t know at the time that it would be the last flight I took before a solid year of isolation and social distancing, but that’s the way it happens sometimes. In a strange way, I’m glad for that because the experience has changed me, not only made me more grateful for my own life but also made it impossible for me not to “Witness.” I close my eyes and I’m back in the refugee camp. I see the faces of the people living there. I hear the din of children playing and crying. I wonder how much longer they’ll have to wait ― how much more they’ll have to endure.

3,"I Escaped The Taliban, But The Fate Of Many — Like My Wife — Is In Biden's Hands",social-justice," Guest Writer When I first drove from Chicago to California as a long-distance truck driver, I loved seeing America from the highway: sunsets over the Great Plains, snowfall in the Rocky Mountains, the Sierras’ jagged peaks. I’m an Afghan refugee who arrived in the United States in September 2019, and I’m still amazed to call this beautiful country my home. I’ve been so happy to bring even a little joy to families across the nation during this difficult time and to deliver essential items to homebound Americans. With a record number of packages shipped in 2020, I’m proud to contribute to the country that saved my life. And yet my resettlement has been bittersweet. Because the Trump administration slashed refugee admissions to just 18,000 people in 2020 — down 80% from Barack Obama’s final year in office — my wife couldn’t come with me. She remains in Afghanistan, where my family became Taliban targets for assisting the American military. The danger she faces is real. In 2012, her brother didn’t return home from the mechanic shop we owned in Ghazni, 90 miles south of Kabul. We searched for him all night and into the next day. Finally, his body turned up outside the city. When the Taliban sent a letter saying I was next, I knew I had to leave. The U.S. made a promise to families like mine: They’d protect us for risking our lives. The outgoing president reneged on that promise, closing America’s doors when global displacement is higher than ever: 79.5 million people worldwide. That’s why I’m relieved President Joe Biden is raising the refugee cap to previous levels, which were over 100,000 a year before Trump took office. It’s the American thing to do, but it’s also critical as we build our way out of the recession. At this moment, nearly 350,000 refugees, including myself, are filling essential roles in the pandemic. We start businesses at higher rates than American-born citizens, according to the think tank New American Economy. And we are committed to becoming American in every sense of the word. Most refugees eventually become citizens, naturalizing at far higher rates than other immigrants in the country. This is absolutely my goal. As soon as my wife arrives, I’ll open a mechanic business like the one I owned in Afghanistan. My wife plans to help with operations. As soon as we’re able, we’ll start the citizenship process. After years of displacement and fear, I’m eager to put down roots. In 2013, I fled to an Australian refugee camp, but I couldn’t move around the country freely or even work. I felt lost without my livelihood. In 2019, when I landed on American soil in Los Angeles, I couldn’t believe I was actually here. I called my wife and mother, and they both cried with tears of relief. My first job was at an electrical supply store in Dallas. Although I was still in training, I earned “employee of the month” after just four weeks. I met friends who invited me into their homes, and I fell in love with American holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day. I stayed seven months, then left to be a truck driver. I now live on the road and work as many hours as possible, saving money and preparing for my wife’s arrival. It’s hard work and long hours ― my shift is from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day ― but I’m happy to do it. I miss my wife daily; I haven’t seen her or my family in nearly eight years. All of them remain in danger. After the Taliban’s threats, my older brother left the country and my younger brother, a talented welder, left our shop to work at a car wash, making less than he did before. I know my family would thrive in America. Refugees are some of the most vetted immigrants that come to the U.S. Most of us find work immediately, often in fields like manufacturing and home health care that desperately need more workers. And after 25 years in the country, refugees have a median income $14,000 higher than the American average, according to a study by NAE. As refugees, we don’t take the freedom and opportunities in America for granted. We’re here to work hard, give back and build a better future for our families and communities. It’s something I think about when I’m dropping off a shipment of packages. No matter the destination, I’ve driven hundreds of miles across this miraculous country to make sure the goods that American families need arrive safely. I only hope my own family can one day see the beauty of this country for themselves. The author came to the U.S. from Afghanistan in 2019 and is a truck driver.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what? Others pointed out that innocent people rarely request pardons. Wow. Congressmen helping Trump on & before 1/6 & then demanding pardons. Makes me think of 18 USC 201: A public official who corruptly seeks anything of value in return for an official act or colluding in fraud shall be imprisoned for up to 15 years & disqualified from office Hi Matt. Why did you ask for a pardon? Cheers 🍻 You sought a pardon because you knew you committed a crime, helping Trump try to overturn the election.Sit down. https://t.co/jNzth4P0m2 You asked for a pardon, and now the DOJ will impolitely ask you to head to your cell, Matt.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Biden Signs More Orders To Undo Trump's Immigration Policies,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed a second spate of orders to undo his predecessor’s immigration policies, demonstrating the powers of the White House and its limitations without support from Congress. His orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration bring to nine the number of executive actions on immigration during his first two weeks in office. With proposed legislation to give legal status and a path to citizenship to all of the estimated 11 million people in the country who don’t have it, Biden has quickly taken aim at many of former President Donald Trump’s sweeping changes to deter immigration, both legal and illegal, and established a vision that is likely to far outlast his tenure if he’s able to muster enough support in a deeply divided Congress. The latest batch of orders are light on immediate changes, though White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden will have more to share in the future and shifts will take time. “I’m not making new law. I’m eliminating bad policy,” Biden said during a signing ceremony without taking questions. Alejandro Mayorkas, whose nomination as Homeland Security secretary was confirmed Tuesday by the Senate, will lead a task force on family separation, focused largely on reuniting parents and children who remain apart. It is unclear exactly how many, but about 5,500 children have been identified in court documents as having been separated during Trump’s presidency, including about 600 whose parents have yet to be found by a court-appointed committee. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families, has asked the administration for legal status in the United States for families that have been separated, as well as financial compensation for those families and attorneys at government expense. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said he would be “extremely disappointed” if the task force limits its scope to helping find parents of the remaining 600 children. A review of border security will include a policy that makes asylum-seekers wait in Mexican border cities for hearings in U.S. immigration court. It is a step toward fulfilling a campaign pledge to end the “Remain in Mexico” policy, known officially as Migrant Protection Protocols, which enrolled nearly 70,000 asylum-seekers since it began in January 2019. The White House said it will also do a “top-to-bottom review of recent regulations, policies, and guidance that have set up barriers to our legal immigration system.” It will include a review of Trump’s “public charge rule,” which makes it more difficult for people who use government benefits to obtain green cards. Esther Olavarria, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council for immigration, went further last month at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting, saying that an executive order aimed at “restoring sanity at the U.S.-Mexico border” would end the “Remain in Mexico” policy and agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for the U.S. to reject asylum applicants and instead send them to those Central American countries with an opportunity to seek protection there. The asylum agreements are not explicitly mentioned in a White House statement on the orders. Olavarria also told mayors of plans to rescind bans on people coming to the country who are deemed economic threats — an apparent reference to Trump’s proclamations to block many temporary work visas and green cards while the economy recovers from a pandemic. It was not included in Tuesday’s announcement. The impact of executive orders that Trump issued his first week in office didn’t start to become apparent until a month later when the Homeland Security Department issued detailed enforcement priorities. His orders laid a foundation for many other of his administration’s hundreds of immigration edicts that followed. Many changes will have to come from agencies like Homeland Security, not the White House, such as rescinding the public-charge rule, said Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The announcements come as Biden aides warn that Trump’s border policies that put asylum increasingly out of reach may take months to unwind — a position that has caused grumbling among some pro-immigration advocates. Roberta Jacobson, a top Biden aide on border issues, asked Spanish-language media on Friday to discourage audiences from coming to the U.S. border. “It is not the moment,” she said in Spanish, adding that the journey was “very dangerous, and we are in the middle of creating a new system.” Psaki reinforced that message from the White House podium on Tuesday, saying it “remains a dangerous trip” and, “This is not the time to come to the United States.” The orders demonstrate that, just as Trump remade immigration policies from the White House, Biden can undo them with the stroke of a pen — some more easily than others. More lasting changes would have to pass Congress, a daunting job that Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush failed to achieve. In an echo of failed legislative pushes in 2007 and 2013, familiar lines of division have formed with overheated rhetoric. Stephen Miller, a top architect of Trump’s policies, said Sunday on Fox News Channel that Biden’s actions amount to the “end of all immigration enforcement in the United States of America.” Pro-immigration groups generally applauded Biden’s latest moves, though they were more muted than the almost-giddy reception to the president’s first-day actions. “The positive steps the administration is taking must be the beginning, not an end unto themselves,” Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum, said Tuesday. “Congress should build on these first steps to find permanent solutions to improve our immigration system.” Kelli Garcia, federal policy counsel of the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund, said the latest orders were encouraging but “will not immediately benefit immigrant communities in dire need of concrete action.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"Nearly 80% Of Hollywood Assistants Are Making Below A Living Wage, New Survey Finds",social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Long underpaid and overworked, Hollywood assistants are facing even deeper financial burdens due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new survey. Many assistants reported having to do the same amount of work for lower pay and incur pandemic-related costs, exacerbating existing inequities and barriers to entry in the entertainment industry. The second annual survey from #PayUpHollywood, released Monday, found that nearly 80% of respondents were paid $50,000 or less in 2020, and 35% made less than $30,000. Both are below $53,600, considered the minimum livable salary in Los Angeles, meaning that someone would be able to spend 30% or less of their income on housing. The organization conducted the survey of about 1,000 assistants from various parts of the entertainment industry in November and December. TV writers Liz Alper and Deirdre Mangan co-founded #PayUpHollywood in 2019 to advocate for higher wages and better working conditions for assistants and support staff, a common entry point for people trying to make it in Hollywood. While these jobs provide a route for moving up the ladder, they often involve working long hours for little pay and few, if any, benefits and worker protections. These inequities were further illuminated by a survey of assistants that the group conducted in fall 2019. The results of that survey showed these jobs are often only open to people from overrepresented and privileged backgrounds because they favor people with existing connections to the entertainment industry and with families that can financially support them — reinforcing the idea that the industry is exclusive and inequitable. As Alper told HuffPost in December, “If you’re not paying people a living wage so that anyone can come in and be able to sustain themselves on the salary that they make, then we’re not going to be a diverse industry.” In the 2020 survey, more than a third of respondents said they are “currently receiving financial support from friends or family to cover reasonable living expenses.” Over half of the assistants in the survey said they had to incur their own expenses for working from home during the pandemic, and of those, 59% said their employer did not reimburse them for those expenses. About 25% of the assistants who said their hours were cut because of the pandemic “were expected to perform the same amount of work as they had pre-COVID,” and 33% said their workload increased because of the pandemic. The survey also revealed that assistants’ jobs take a toll on their mental health: Nearly half said they were “currently experiencing job burnout,” and another third said they were “not currently experiencing job burnout but have in the past.” Most respondents said they did not feel comfortable taking time off for their mental health, and a significant number said they feared retaliation for speaking out about potentially exploitative or abusive practices at their jobs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, about 77% of the survey’s respondents identified as white, showing how these inequitable working conditions contribute to a lack of diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. To begin to correct some of these inequities, #PayUpHollywood recommends that employers set $53,600 as a minimum salary for assistants, with at least 3% annual raises to keep up with increases in the cost of living. Because assistant jobs can differ depending on the kind of role or employer, the group also encouraged studios, agencies, production companies and other institutions to conduct their own surveys to better understand assistants’ working conditions, and use those findings to enact their own reforms. In the absence of wider industry-level changes, the group urged direct supervisors to take steps to change their workplace culture and practices. “Change comes by chipping away at old foundations in hopes of laying down something new,” the group wrote in the survey’s main findings. “Every single person who commits to helping, even in some small way, is one more person helping to lay down the new foundation.” Read the full list of findings here.

12,Biden Launches Effort To Repair Trump's Immigration Damage,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost President Joe Biden plans to create a task force to reunite migrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border and unwind certain asylum restrictions in an effort to undo some of the Trump administration’s most damaging policies. The task force, announced on Tuesday, will aim to identify the more than 500 children separated from family members who have yet to be located and will present proposals to the president and other federal agencies to help reunite those families. The task force is to be led by Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and will include officials from DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department. Former President Donald Trump’s family separation policy took more than 5,400 children from their parents at the border in 2017 and 2018. The goal was to deter families from coming to the U.S., through a “zero tolerance” approach, even though many were asylum-seekers with the right to pursue relief here. Instead, when they arrived at the border, the families were torn apart so the parents could be prosecuted for illegal entry while their children were sent to stay in separate facilities, in foster homes, or with other families. Some of these children were infants and toddlers; many experienced severe trauma as a result of that separation. The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics called it “government-sanctioned child abuse.” Trump ended the policy amid public pressure nearly a year after it began, and a court-ordered the government to reunite the families. While the government reunited most of the roughly 4,000 children covered by the court order with their parents, the parents of 545 children had not yet been found as of October, according to a court filing. For some families, it was too late, as the parents had been deported back to their home countries. Biden vowed to do more to reunite those families. He castigated Trump for the separations during a presidential debate in October. “Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated,” Biden said. “And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal.” Beginning the reunification process is among Biden’s several efforts to rehaul the immigration system decimated by Trump. In his first few hours as president, Biden issued several immigration-related executive orders and proposed a new bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people in the country. Although Biden is likely to face resistance from Republicans, immigration reform advocates and experts have applauded the president’s plans for prioritizing such matters. Along with the new family reunification task force, Biden also launched a series of efforts to restore the U.S. asylum system by working with foreign governments to ensure that Central American refugees and asylum-seekers can obtain proper legal protections. The administration announced it will scale back Migrant Protection Protocols, a Trump-issued program that has forced more than 65,000 asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico ― sometimes for years ― until their day in U.S. immigration court. It is unclear what will happen to the people currently stranded in Mexico as a result of MPP. Tuesday’s executive order also rescinds Trump’s memorandum requiring family sponsors to repay the government if relatives receive public benefits. The reforms also instruct federal agencies to review the public charge rule ― a seldom-used policy in place since the 1880s that allows the federal government to deny entry to immigrants, especially green card holders, who are deemed to be overly reliant on public benefits, such as cash assistance programs. Trump expanded the rule, causing fears in the undocumented community about seeking health care and vaccinations.

13,"ACLU, For The First Time, Elects A Black Person As Its President",social-justice," NEW YORK (AP) — Deborah Archer, a professor at New York University School of Law with expertise in civil rights and racial justice, has become the first Black person in the 101-year history of the American Civil Liberties Union to be elected its president. The ACLU announced Monday that Archer was elected over the weekend in a virtual meeting of the organization’s 69-member board of directors. She succeeds Susan Herman, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had served as president since 2008. As the ACLU’s eighth president since 1920, Archer will act as chair of its board of the directors, overseeing organizational matters and the setting of civil liberties policies. The fight against racial injustice is expected to be a top priority. The ACLU’s day-to-day operations are managed by its executive director — a post currently held by Anthony Romero. During former President Donald Trump’s four years in office, the ACLU filed an unprecedented 413 lawsuits and other legal actions against his administration, challenging policies related to immigrant rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, racial justice and other issues. The campaign against Trump’s administration — promoted in a catchy “See You In Court” ad campaign — fueled huge increases in donations and membership. According to Romero, the ACLU national office and its state affiliates received about $175 million in donations in the three months after Trump’s election, helping to finance a major expansion of staff. “The ACLU has proven itself as an invaluable voice in the fight for civil rights in the last four years of the Trump era, and we are better positioned than ever to face the work ahead,” Archer said. Early in her career, after graduating from Yale Law School, she was a legal fellow at the ACLU in 1997-98. She has been a member of the ACLU’s board since 2009, and a general counsel and member of the board’s executive committee since 2017. At NYU Law School, Archer is a professor of clinical law and director of its Civil Rights Clinic. She has served as chair of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates alleged police misconduct, and also was assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “There is no one better equipped, who best personifies or is more capable to helm the future battles for civil rights, civil liberties, and systemic equality than Deborah Archer,” Romero said. Romero is hopeful that the newly installed administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will be more attentive to the ACLU’s major concerns than the Trump administration was, but he expects daunting challenges ahead. “President Trump may be gone but his toxic legacy on civil rights and civil liberties is still very much with us,” Romero said. “It will take years to clean up.” “At the top of our agenda is the effort to redouble this nation’s longstanding but frayed commitment to civil rights and racial justice,” he added. “The country needs a president who will be transformational when it comes to these issues.” Other ACLU priorities, Romero said, include voting rights, a rollback of the Trump administration’s get-tough immigration policies, and joining in efforts to thwart anti-abortion legislation surfacing in many Republican-governed states."
14,I Had A Baby At The Height Of The Pandemic. Here's What I Learned About Gender Inequality.,social-justice," Guest Writer I got promoted to president of the advertising agency I work for when I was five months pregnant. To say that I work for a progressive company is an understatement. Three months into taking on the role, the coronavirus pandemic hit. At the same time, pregnancy complications forced me to spend most of the month of March in the hospital where I ultimately had the baby, six weeks early, at the boiling point of the outbreak. Anyone who’s had a baby knows how tough those first few weeks are. This is my second baby, so I thought I was prepared. But this time was different. We were in lockdown, there was no support system to help with the baby, no friends and family coming over to make meals or help you sneak in a quick shower or nap. My mom works in a hospital, so she couldn’t even be there. It was just us. My husband had spent the majority of the month with me in the hospital, working and doing calls from my bedside. He was as engaged and supportive as anyone could ever ask for. But given that the world (and the economy) were crashing, he had to get back to work four days after we brought the baby home from the hospital. It was the necessary decision. As a leader in his firm, he had a responsibility to help the company through an unprecedented time. As a businesswoman, I completely understood. It’s what he needed to do for his company, his clients and for our family. But as someone who also had a responsibility to lead a company I’ve helped build, employees that I deeply care for, and a career I’ve worked tirelessly to grow, I deeply resented him. I resented him for having a choice, and for having a backstop that I certainly didn’t have. We were both becoming parents again, and we were both responsible for leading our companies. The only difference was — I am a woman. There I was, straddling the same decisions and guilt women have been facing for generations. Knowing that there was no choice — of course my family comes first, but I also felt this immense sense of guilt and failure that I wasn’t able to be there to do my job and navigate us through what was undoubtedly the most challenging situation in the history of our business. As a business leader, I have always been passionate about advocating for policies that ensure we are empowering the women in our company ― to ensure there is equal opportunity and pay. I believe we’ve been successful in doing that. In fact, the majority of our senior roles in the company are held by women. All of that said, this experience made me realize more than anything that policies that focus on women aren’t enough. This is a cultural problem, one that our country is far behind on. There’s a reason that women only hold 25% of executive or senior-level roles despite making up 49% of the college-educated workforce. It’s no secret the falloff happens when women start to have families. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, women have been exiting the workforce in record numbers in order to care for children. In this country, society teaches us that a woman is more necessary for caretaking or that we somehow are better at it. And what permeates that idea even more are corporate policies that miss the point. “In this country, society teaches us that a woman is more necessary for caretaking or that we somehow are better at it. And what permeates that idea even more are corporate policies that miss the point.” Many companies have generous maternity leave policies, but when leaving fathers out of the equation, all those policies do is continue to perpetuate the idea that caretaking is a woman’s role, and that it’s expected for her to put her career on hold in order to fill that role. Beyond this, many companies do have parental leave policies for fathers and mothers or primary caretakers — but there is an unspoken rule that if the father takes advantage of the policy, he will be penalized or jeopardize a promotion or career track. If companies are truly committed to gender equality, it’s not enough to just have PR-friendly policies that make your company look progressive. You need to ensure those policies are ingrained in your culture. That means ensuring leadership, men or women, are taking time off for parental leave to set the example. That means making parental leave mandatory so no employee has to feel like they’re making a choice that will jeopardize their career. Becoming a parent is a beautiful moment — and a great responsibility that is equally important no matter your gender. Having this filter is paramount in our ability to close the gender gap, and even more urgent as the gap is becoming exacerbated by the global pandemic. Our baby will turn 1 at the end of March, and those early weeks sometimes feel like a lifetime ago. Just like everyone else, we’re working to figure out our new normal, and finding the balance between supporting each others’ careers and maximizing time with our boys. Professionally, I returned to work (remotely) last summer. During the three months I was out, the way the company needed to operate fundamentally changed. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit there were some major insecurities when I came back ― I had to learn the new ways we worked, and I had to strike a balance between humility and assertiveness as I figured out how to take the reins back while taking cues from the team that had weathered the storm while I was out. Just like everyone else, I evolved to the new normal and quickly found my groove ― and lucky enough, the company and I are both thriving.

15,Democrats Reintroduce Legislation To 'Decriminalize Immigration',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Democrats are pushing sweeping legislation to decriminalize immigration and disrupt the “prison-to-deportation” pipeline. On Tuesday, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and co-sponsors Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) held a virtual press conference discussing their New Way Forward Act — originally introduced in 2019, alongside Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). It would ban for-profit immigration detention facilities, end the use of local police for immigration enforcement and decriminalize border crossings. It also would eliminate mandatory deportation, for instance in the case of people with previous criminal records, to instead allow judges to use their discretion in deciding cases. “Decriminalizing immigration is not a radical concept at all,” García said. “What is radical is caging school-aged children. What is radical is detaining thousands of refugees in dangerous conditions of squalor. We’re simply asking for fair treatment.” Within days of being in office, the Biden-Harris administration began their efforts to undo former President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant legacy by repealing the anti-Muslim travel ban and proposing that Congress pass a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people in the country. Jayapal, who identifies as a “proud immigrant” and naturalized citizen, said that while it was a “relief” to have Trump out of office after “four xenophobic years,” it is “not enough to just reverse the hateful policies.” “America’s racist, xenophobic immigration system has been broken for decades,” Jayapal said, citing the nation’s history of separating families through deportation and considering immigration violations, like crossing the border outside a port of entry, as criminal and not civil offenses. “This legislation keeps families together, it advances racial justice and it protects due process for everyone,” she said. This moment requires bold solutions. We must transform our immigration system and move away from policies that criminalize, incarcerate, and deport community members. We need a #NewWayForward. pic.twitter.com/92TJolUgJ6 Pressley hopes the legislation will end the “prison-to-deportation” pipeline, in which immigrants of color, who are stopped and arrested more often by police and given harsher sentences than their white peers, can end up in ICE detention and at times deported back to their home countries. “For too long our immigration and criminal legal systems have been deeply and fundamentally intertwined,” Pressley said, adding that this bill package aims to create an immigration system that “finally centers the humanity of our immigrant neighbors.” Chanthon Bun, a Cambodian refugee, told his story during the press conference. Born during the Cambodian genocide, he moved to Los Angeles as a child in 1985. At age 18, he got involved with a gang and committed a robbery and was sentenced to 49 years in prison. Last year, after 22 years incarcerated, Bun was set to be released on parole. Immigration and Customs Enforcement informed him that he would be deported upon release, back to a country he fled due to violence, where his father and other family members had been killed. It was only after protests from the local community that Bun was released without being placed in ICE custody. “The New Way Forward would help stop this prison-to-ICE detention pipeline and will keep families together,” Bun said, who survived COVID-19 after contracting it during a massive outbreak in California’s San Quentin state prison, where he was incarcerated. “What ICE is doing now is traumatizing not just the person incarcerated, but the family and community.” The Trump administration notoriously separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border in 2018 — hundreds of whom have still not been reunited. The Democrats’ proposed legislation goes beyond simply stopping family separations at the border — they’re pushing for the end of family separations through deportations and to allow those previously deported to reapply to reenter the U.S. and reunite with family still living here. “All families should be reunited whether they were separated by Trump or by deportation,” Jayapal said Tuesday. After a judge in Texas issued a temporary halt to Biden’s 100-day ban on most deportations on Tuesday, García said Biden’s deportation ban was “legally sound, morally necessary and we’re confident this enormous miscarriage of justice will be rectified.” Asked whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) knew of their immigration bill, García said the lawmakers “hope to earn her support.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Judge Bars Biden From Enforcing 100-day Deportation Ban,social-justice," HOUSTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday barred the U.S. government from enforcing a 100-day deportation moratorium that is a key immigration priority of President Joe Biden. U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton issued a temporary restraining order sought by Texas, which sued on Friday against a Department of Homeland Security memo that instructed immigration agencies to pause most deportations. Tipton’s order is an early blow to the Biden administration, which has proposed far-reaching changes sought by immigration advocates, including a plan to legalize an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Biden promised during his campaign to pause most deportations for 100 days. The order represents a victory for Texas’ Republican leaders, who often sued to stop programs enacted by Biden’s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. It also showed that just as Democratic-led states and immigration groups fought former President Donald Trump over immigration in court, often successfully, so too will Republicans with Biden in office. David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security secretary, signed a memo on Biden’s first day directing immigration authorities to focus on national security and public safety threats as well as anyone apprehended entering the U.S. illegally after Nov. 1. That was a reversal from Trump administration policy that made anyone in the U.S. illegally a priority for deportation. The 100-day moratorium went into effect Friday and applied to almost anyone who entered the U.S. without authorization before November. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that the moratorium violated federal law as well as an agreement Texas signed with the Department of Homeland Security late in the Trump administration. That agreement required Homeland Security to consult with Texas and other states before taking any action to “reduce, redirect, reprioritize, relax, or in any way modify immigration enforcement.” The Biden administration argued in court filings that the agreement is unenforceable because “an outgoing administration cannot contract away that power for an incoming administration.” Paxton’s office, meanwhile, submitted a Fox News opinion article as evidence that “refusal to remove illegal aliens is directly leading to the immediate release of additional illegal aliens in Texas.” Paxton has championed conservative and far-right causes in court, including a failed lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden’s victory over Trump, as he himself faces an FBI investigation over accusations by top former aides that he abused his office at the service of a donor.

1,"After Trump's Execution Spree, Criminal Justice Leaders Urge Biden To End Death Penalty",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost During Donald Trump’s final week in office, the federal government executed three prisoners on death row. By the time President Joe Biden was inaugurated, the Trump administration had overseen a record 13 executions in seven months, a killing spree unparalleled in modern U.S. history. Now, a coalition of prosecutors and attorneys general is calling on Biden to immediately end the federal death penalty, calling it “an assault on human dignity and an affront to American values.” In a letter sent on Monday, nearly 100 criminal justice leaders implored Biden to commute the sentences of everyone on federal death row and to instruct federal prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in future cases. “The death penalty is an archaic and failed institution that is rooted in racism and too often punishes the innocent,” said Miriam Krinsky, executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution and a former federal prosecutor who organized the letter. “The previous administration’s cruel and ruthless killing spree undermined the already-fragile trust in the justice system and revealed that a simple pause on executions is not nearly enough.” The Trump administration restarted federal executions last summer — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic — after a 17-year hiatus in the practice. Among those executed by the federal government was Lisa Montgomery, a mentally ill woman who was sexually tortured as a child; Dustin Higgs, who maintained his innocence up until his death; and Corey Johnson, who had an intellectual disability. Both Higgs and Johnson were recovering from COVID-19 at the time of their deaths. The letter, which was signed by a number of U.S. attorneys and former Department of Justice officials, warns that the death penalty is tainted by racial bias and exists in tension with the constitutional ban against cruel and unusual punishment and the guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law. “We also now know that we have not executed the worst of the worst, but often instead put to death the unluckiest of the unlucky — the impoverished, the poorly represented, and the most broken,” the letter reads. “Time and again, we have executed individuals with long histories of debilitating mental illness, childhoods marred by unspeakable physical and mental abuse, and intellectual disabilities that have prevented them from leading independent adult lives. We have executed individuals with trial lawyers so derelict in their duties and obligations that they never bothered to uncover long histories of illness and trauma. We have also likely executed the innocent.” There are 49 people left on federal death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. During his presidential campaign, Biden pledged to eliminate the federal death penalty, noting that “we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time.” But he has not elaborated on his plans for the people on death row. Federal executions take place at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, which houses the only federal death chamber in the U.S. The letter also asks Biden to order that the death chamber be taken apart so it is never used again. “We ask you to not only support federal legislative efforts to end capital punishment, but to take all steps in your power to disassemble the machinery of death and ensure future presidents cannot execute the dozens of people on federal death row at will,” the letter says. “[K]eeping intact the death chamber at Terre Haute leaves the stage still set for unspeakable cruelty that says more about us as a society than it does about those we execute.” More than 35 members of Congress have also signed a letter asking Biden to commute the sentences of the remaining people on death row.

2,10 Billionaires Made Enough Money During The Pandemic To Vaccinate The Entire World,social-justice," Impact Editor, HuffPost The coronavirus recession is over, if you ask the billionaires of the world. According to a report released Monday by Oxfam, the top 1,000 billionaires collectively lost about 30% of their wealth when COVID-19 restrictions stalled global economies in March. By the end of November, they’d made it all back. For the world’s richest, it took less than 10 months to recover the financial losses caused by the pandemic. For the world’s poorest, the report estimated, it will take more than 10 years. “While a wealthy minority have amassed vast fortunes before and during the pandemic, the majority of the world’s population have been struggling to survive on poverty wages and without access to decent health care or education,” Paul O’Brien, vice president of Oxfam America, told HuffPost. “Today’s levels of extreme wealth concentration are not sustainable. Billionaires are a sign of economic sickness, not health. They are the symptom of a broken economy.” The pandemic threatens to undo the progress of more than two decades of declining global poverty. The World Bank has estimated that more than 200 million people may sink into poverty as a result of COVID-19’s economic effects — in low-income countries and in rich ones, including the United States. Startlingly, the Oxfam report found that the cost to prevent people from falling into a life lived on less than $5.50 a day would be far less than the profits made by the world’s wealthiest during the coronavirus crisis. “Jeff Bezos could have personally paid each of Amazon’s 876,000 employees a one-off $105,000 bonus ... and still be as wealthy as he was at the beginning of the pandemic.” According to Oxfam’s calculation — based on poverty data from the World Bank and wealth data from Credit Suisse and the Forbes Billionaires list — the world’s 10 richest people, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon Musk, added $540 billion to their collective net worth in the last three quarters of 2020. If they handed over around $80 billion, they could keep those imperiled millions above the poverty line for a year while economies rebuild. With the remainder of their 2020 profits, these 10 billionaires could pay for both rounds of the COVID-19 vaccine for every person on Earth and still come out ahead. (Oxfam used World Health Organization data to estimate a cost of around $9 per dose, a total expenditure of $141.2 billion for the world’s 7.8 billion inhabitants.) Oxfam timed the release of the report to coincide with the start of the annual World Economic Forum’s Davos meeting (virtual this year), where industry and government leaders “convene to address critical issues.” The report paints a stark portrait of the divide between CEOs at the top and laborers at the bottom, many of whom have continued to work in dangerous circumstances, without the option to stay home to avoid the virus. Raj Sisodia, a business professor at Babson College and co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism movement, likened standard corporate structure to India’s caste system. At the top: generously paid professional, college-educated people with benefits and stock options, supported by the “chew them up and spit them out workforce” — people locked into low-paying hourly jobs, without health care, paid leave or retirement benefits. “That needs to change,” Sisodia said. “There has to be a modest ratio between pay at the top and pay the bottom.” That’s not currently the case. In the last 40 years, executive pay has increased by 1,000% while worker pay has budged less than 12%. Amazon logged record sales as nearly 20,000 Amazon workers contracted COVID-19 between March and September of 2020. With the wealth he accumulated over the same period, the Oxfam report found that “Jeff Bezos could have personally paid each of Amazon’s 876,000 employees a one-off $105,000 bonus ... and still be as wealthy as he was at the beginning of the pandemic.” But handouts won’t bring about the fundamental restructuring that is needed, said O’Brien: “Asking the wealthy to be charitable is no substitute for taxing them and the companies whose profits have soared in past years.” Oxfam recommends implementing wealth taxes as an important step toward creating a fairer, more equitable economic system. “The super-rich use a network of tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of tax and an army of wealth managers to secure sky-high returns that are not available to an ordinary investor,” he continued. “Big corporations are dodging taxes, driving down wages for their workers and the prices paid to producers, and investing less in their business in order to maximize returns to their wealthy shareholders. Both big business and the super-rich use their money and connections to ensure government policy works for them. This has to stop.” The report’s other policy recommendations include investing in social services and guaranteed income, moving away from using gross domestic product as a metric for economic growth, and making fighting inequality central to pandemic recovery. “The most effective way of getting people back on their feet in the wake of this pandemic is to build fairer, more sustainable economies that work for everyone and not just a fortunate few,” said O’Brien. “The Davos set, including corporate executives, must join efforts to make this a reality.” HuffPost’s “Work In Progress” series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by Porticus.

3,Democrats Start Reining In Big Expectations For Immigration Bill,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s taken only days for Democrats gauging how far President Joe Biden’s bold immigration proposal can go in Congress to acknowledge that if anything emerges, it will likely be significantly more modest. As they brace to tackle a politically flammable issue that’s resisted major congressional action since the 1980s, Democrats are using words like “aspirational” to describe Biden’s plan and “herculean” to express the effort they’ll need to prevail. A cautious note came from the White House on Friday when press secretary Jen Psaki said the new administration views Biden’s plan as a “first step” it hopes will be “the basis” of discussions in Congress. Democrats’ measured tones underscore the fragile road they face on a paramount issue for their minority voters, progressives, and activists. Immigration proponents advocating an all-out fight say Democrats’ new hold on the White House and Congress provides a major edge, but they concede they may have to accept less than total victory. Paving a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the centerpiece of Biden’s plan is “the stake at the summit of the mountain,” Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America’s Voice, said in an interview. He said proponents may have to accept “stepping stones” along the way. The citizenship process in Biden’s plan would take as little as three years for some people, eight years for others. It would make it easier for certain workers to stay in the U.S. temporarily or permanently, provide development aid to Central American nations in hopes of reducing immigration and move toward bolstering border screening technology. No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said in an interview this week that the likeliest package to emerge would start with creating a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers. They are over 1 million immigrants who’ve lived in the U.S. most of their lives after being brought here illegally as children. Over 600,000 of them have temporary permission to live in the U.S. under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Former President Barack Obama created that program administratively, and Durbin and others want to protect it by enacting it into law. Durbin, who called Biden’s plan “aspirational,” said he’ll push for as many other elements as possible, including more visas for agricultural workers and others. “We understand the political reality of a 50-50 Senate, that any changes in immigration will require cooperation between the parties,” said Durbin, who is on track to become Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. He said Senate legislation likely “will not reach the same levels” as Biden’s proposal. The Senate is split evenly between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris tipping the chamber to Democrats with her tie-breaking vote. Even so, passing major legislation requires 60 votes to overcome filibusters or endless procedural delays. That means 10 Republicans must join all 50 Democrats to enact an immigration measure, a tall order. “Passing immigration reform through the Senate, particularly, is a herculean task,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will also play a lead role in the battle. He said Democrats “will get it done” but the effort will require negotiation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who’s worked with Democrats on past immigration efforts, said “comprehensive immigration is going to be a tough sale” this year. “I think the space in a 50-50 Senate will be some kind of DACA deal,” he said. Illustrating the bargaining ahead, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who’s sought earlier immigration compromises, praised parts of Biden’s plan but said she wants changes including more visas for the foreign workers her state’s tourism industry uses heavily. Democrats’ hurdles are formidable. They have razor-thin majorities in a House and Senate where Republican support for easing immigration restrictions is usually scant. Acrid partisan relationships were intensified by former President Donald Trump’s clamorous tenure. Biden will have to spend plenty of political capital and time on earlier, higher priority bills battling the pandemic and bolstering the economy, leaving his future clout uncertain. Democrats also must resolve tactical differences. Sharry said immigration groups prefer Democrats push for the strongest possible bill without concessions to Republicans’ demands like boosting border security spending. He said hopes for a bipartisan breakthrough are “a fool’s errand” because the GOP has largely opposed immigration overhauls for so long. But prevailing without GOP votes would mean virtual unanimity among congressional Democrats, a huge challenge. It would also mean Democrats would have to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which they may not have the votes to do, or concoct other procedural routes around the 60-vote hurdle. “I’m going to start negotiating” with Republicans, said Durbin. He said a bipartisan bill would be better “if we can do it” because it would improve chances for passage. Democrats already face attacks from Republicans, eyeing next year’s elections, on an issue that helped power Trump’s 2016 victory by fortifying his support from many white voters. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Biden’s proposal would “prioritize help for illegal immigrants and not our fellow citizens.” Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee, said the measure would hurt “hard-working Americans and the millions of immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process.” Democrats say such allegations are false but say it’s difficult to compose crisp, sound-bite responses on the complex issue. It requires having “an adult conversation” with voters, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said in an interview. “Yeah, this is about people, but it’s about the economy” too, said Spanberger, a moderate from a district where farms and technology firms hire many immigrants. “In central Virginia, we rely on immigration. And you may not like that, but we do.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Millennial Moms Have Been Driven To Their Breaking Point,social-justice," Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last spring, Shannon, a 28-year-old single mom, says her life was thrown into chaos. Shannon is a psychiatric nurse who, prior to the pandemic, worked the night shift. She slept during the day while her second-grader went to school, and lived with a roommate who was around if her son woke up at night. When the first cases of the virus surfaced in her home state of Wisconsin, Shannon was immediately transferred to her hospital’s COVID-19 wing, which terrified her. No one knew then how deadly the virus might be for children. She dreaded bringing it home and making her son sick. (All of the moms interviewed for this piece asked to use their first names so they could candidly discuss personal details about work and family members’ health.) And then schools closed for in-person learning. Shannon had to cut back her hours almost completely, from 40 to 60 hours per week to 16 per month. Her son is on the autism spectrum and requires constant, hands-on attention throughout his remote schoolwork. Once Shannon cut back her hours, she could no longer afford her $1,600 monthly rent. So she and her son moved back in with Shannon’s mother, where they have been living ever since. “Before the pandemic, I was fully capable of taking care of my child. I was financially responsible. I had a 401K, I had investments. But when the pandemic hit, what were single parents supposed to do? With young children?!” Shannon asked. “I felt like I was screwed.” No group or demographic has been spared the pain or stress of the pandemic, but millennial mothers (women born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s) have been hit particularly hard for a wide range of reasons, from the unique demands of caring for young children to the specific toll it has taken on their careers. Month after month, the stress has piled on top of those women who have stoically endured the relentlessness of pandemic parenting — to the point where mental health experts worry it could become chronic. And while the vaccine is here, we are months away from it being widely available enough to make meaningful changes in how millennial parents navigate their days. After 10 long months, and with no immediate relief in sight, millennial mothers are at a worrisome tipping point. On the whole, parents have been more stressed than non-parents over the past year. And millennial moms, who are currently in their 20s and 30s, tend to have younger children who require the most hands-on care as schools around the country have gone (and stayed) remote and thousands of child care centers have closed or hiked their rates to stay afloat. Even before the pandemic hit, women tended to take on a greater share of parenting and household responsibilities than men. They have been doing even more during the pandemic. Estimates suggest that because of the pandemic, the average woman now spends the hourly equivalent of a full-time job on unpaid child care. So it makes perfect sense that the pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on working moms — more than 2 million of whom have left the workforce from the winter of 2019 through this fall. And for millennial women, who generally hit their peak earning years in their mid-40s and are smack-dab in the middle of when they’re supposed to be making their biggest career gains, there simply may be no bouncing back. “The coronavirus pandemic is stretching millennial parents to the breaking point,” warned an August report by the progressive Center For American Progress, “and may set maternal labor force participation back decades.” Of course, busy millennial moms don’t spend their days contemplating these larger trends; they are too busy trying to get themselves and their families through their days. “You work hard to have a career and an identity outside of just being a mom, and everything was taken away.” Kim, a 35-year-old mother with a 5-year-old and 2-year-old at home, worked in early intervention prior to the pandemic, helping children with medical complexities navigate their days. When the virus hit, all home visits stopped immediately. Kim tried to maintain telehealth appointments, but it was impossible to do with any kind of professionalism while watching her own young kids. “We had to make the really hard decision to have me request a furlough,” said Kim, who said many of the young mothers she worked with had to do the same. Then, several months later, she was let go. “It was devastating,” Kim said. “You work hard to have a career and an identity outside of just being a mom, and everything was taken away.” Financially, the change has been “terrifying” for her family, but her husband is still employed and they have been able to cut their expenses back to the bare minimum and make ends meet so far. Even more, Kim worries for her children, particularly her 5-year-old, who has had to deal with the ups and downs of school closures, family illness (Kim’s father had COVID-19) and the total loss of her routines. “I have not slept, wracking my brain, like, ‘How can I make this better for her? Now this is my job, to try and make this better for her, for them, and I can’t,’” Kim said. Nearly every study or survey from the past year that has offered a real-time glimpse at mothers’ mental load during the pandemic shows that the stressors they face — loss of work, loss of routine and support, fears over how to keep children safe and how to support them emotionally — have hurt moms’ mental health. In one survey of new moms, 80% said they’d experienced a surge in stress. In another, mothers were far more likely than fathers to say coronavirus stress had taken a toll on their mental health — which, again, makes sense, since women in heterosexual households tend to take on significantly more caregiving. “All families are struggling right now in their own ways. I don’t think I know a single family that is having an amazing time during this pandemic,” said Christina Mondi-Rago, a researcher affiliated with American University in Washington, D.C. and an investigator with COVID-Forward, a national survey study that seeks to explore how parents and families are coping during the pandemic. (It is open for parents to join through the end of January.) And after 10-plus months of stress and social distancing, millennial moms who were already staying home with their children before COVID-19 are burned out, too. “I did take off work for four to five years to stay home with them. I had this dream, and it feels like a little bit of it was plucked away.” Julia, 37, a stay-at-home parent who used to relish her days taking her children to the library and on playdates, said she feels like her world has closed in around her. She finds herself half-dreading: What am I going to do with them tomorrow?! Julia feels a sense of grief that this short window of time she gets with her children while they’re young has been consumed by the pandemic, and she worries about how isolated they have become. She and her husband decided to use their recent stimulus check to enroll their children in preschool several hours a week later this winter — which they had not planned on before — because they are worried about their development. “I do get emotional about it,” admitted Julia. “I did take off work for four to five years to stay home with them. I had this dream, and it feels like a little bit of it was plucked away.” Through it all, millennial moms aren’t complaining. All of the moms in this story stopped several times while being interviewed to emphasize how fortunate they feel that their children have been healthy and that they have managed so far. They called themselves “selfish” for talking about the stress they’ve been under, and noted how lucky they have been to hold on and to have various family members to lean on. Each of them has managed to eke out new routines and grown used to the ever-changing demands of parenting during a global pandemic. Nationally, there have been small blips of relief. Many school districts and child care centers have reopened, at least to some extent, and a second round of stimulus checks recently came through. But there is a certain level of resignation among many women at this point in the pandemic that mental health professionals are worried about. After months of living under significant stress, millennial mothers have become emotionally numbed to the pressure of parenting under extraordinary circumstances. “A lot of parents are feeling very burnt out right now, and there certainly are concerns among mental health clinicians about increased rates of mental health issues over time, especially during the pandemic,” said Mondi-Rago. She added that certain groups of millennial moms are at particularly high risk of developing significant levels of stress, including women who are pregnant or newly postpartum, women who are facing financial pressure, single moms and women of color. “But certainly, many parents are at risk for becoming even more stressed, and more burnt out, over time,” she added. When stress becomes chronic, as it has for many mothers at this point, it substantially increases risk for clinical anxiety, depression and various physical health concerns. There is, of course, hope that things could soon change — but perhaps not fast enough. We are still months away from widespread vaccination. Many schools and day cares remain closed. So many parents are under huge pressure just trying to make it all work, and there is no social safety net to catch them. “No one is thriving,” said Mariclaire, a 38-year-old mom of two who works full-time in-person as a teacher, while her eldest follows a hybrid schedule and her youngest is in day care. At various points in the pandemic, she has felt as though she was “drowning” under the pressure of juggling her work with watching her young children. “Life has been completely turned upside down ... and it feels like the expectation is just: ‘You can do this,’” she said. “Thank you for your confidence, I guess?” Senior Wellness & Parenting Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Biden Launches Effort To Undo Trump's Damage On Immigration,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost After years of Donald Trump attacking immigrants, President Joe Biden is beginning his tenure by undoing many of the former president’s policies and overhauling the U.S. immigration system. The Biden administration has what it calls a comprehensive approach to immigration. In his first few hours as president, Biden plans to propose a new bill that would include a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people in the country. In addition, he issued immigration-related executive actions: He ordered government to halt the construction of the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and review whether contracts already issued for it could be diverted to other projects, as well as to end the national emergency declaration for the border. Trump used the declaration to justify taking money slated for other means to fund the wall. He rescinded Trump’s travel ban, which primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries. Biden launched an effort to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, which allows undocumented young people to remain in the U.S. and work legally. The program remains in effect in spite of Trump’s efforts to end it, but is still facing legal challenges. Biden is also expected to take more actions on immigration: Biden will reinstate deportation priorities undone by Trump, who encouraged immigration agents to pursue removal for all undocumented people rather than focusing first on criminals and repeat border-crossers. Biden will reverse Trump’s effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census. The onslaught of immigration reforms signals a new and welcomed era for immigrants, who were among Trump’s favorite scapegoats and targets. Immigration reform advocates and experts applauded Biden’s first-day plans for prioritizing immigration and quickly undoing the damage done by the previous president. Biden’s ambitious legislative bill, which will be sent to Congress on Wednesday for review, details an eight-year roadmap to citizenship for current immigrants, including approximately 700,000 Dreamers and 400,000 immigrants living with Temporary Protected Status. Members of those programs, as well as certain farm workers, would qualify for green cards immediately and be eligible for citizenship after three years. Other undocumented immigrants would be eligible for green cards after five years. In all cases, the immigrants would be subjected to background checks and required to pay taxes. The plan would also reunite families, boost technology at the border, and increase the diversity visa program from 55,000 visas to 80,000 visas per year. Trump attempted to terminate the diversity visa program, as well as DACA and certain TPS programs. The proposal would set up multiple processing centers abroad to identify and screen refugees, in addition to allotting $4 billion in aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras over four years to address the root cause of migration. If passed, Biden’s reforms would be the largest legislative overhaul of the U.S. immigration system since Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration in the 1980s. However, it may be difficult to get them through Congress. The last immigration overhaul bill passed the Senate in a 68-32 vote in 2013, but the Democratic majority was larger at the time than the 50-50 split Biden will be dealing with. (Vice President Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, can cast a tie-breaking vote.) However, it will be an easier lift in the House, where that 2013 bill never got a vote. Democrats control the lower chamber now and are likely to support a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,"Biden's First Act As President: Executive Orders On Pandemic, Climate, Immigration",social-justice," In his first official acts as president, Joe Biden is signing executive orders on a broad range of issues, from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change and immigration, to fulfill campaign promises. Highlights of actions Biden is taking Wednesday: MASK REQUIREMENT: Biden is requiring the use of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands and by federal employees and contractors. Consistently masking up is a practice that science has shown to be effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, particularly when social distancing is difficult to maintain. He is challenging all Americans to wear a mask for the first 100 days of his administration. That’s a critical period, since communities will still be vulnerable to the virus even as the pace of vaccination increases in pursuit of Biden’s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: Biden also is directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, which Donald Trump withdrew from earlier this year after accusing it of incompetence and bowing to Chinese pressure over the coronavirus. Symbolizing Biden’s commitment to a more prominent global role, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients announced that Dr. Anthony Fauci will deliver a speech Thursday to the WHO as head of a U.S. delegation. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, will lay out how the administration intends to work with the WHO on reforms, supporting the coronavirus response and promoting global health and health security ___ PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: Biden will sign an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate accord, fulfilling a campaign pledge to get back into the global climate pact on Day One. Trump, a supporter of oil, gas and coal, had made a first priority of pulling out of global efforts to cut climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions. It will take 30 days for the U.S. to officially be back in. REVIEWING TRUMP ROLLBACKS: Biden’s Day One plans also include a temporary moratorium on new Trump administration oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, moving to revoke a presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline and reviewing a Trump administration freeze on vehicle mileage and emissions standards. Biden also is setting in motion an evaluation of another Trump move that cut boundaries and protections for some national monuments. Agencies will be directed to consider impact of climate change on disadvantaged communities and on future generations from any regulatory action that affected fossil fuel emissions, a new requirement. ___ ENDING BAN ON MUSLIM TRAVELERS: Biden is ending what is variously known as the “travel ban” or the “Muslim ban,” one of the first acts of the Trump administration. Trump in January 2017 banned foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries from entry into the country. After a lengthy court fight, a watered-down version of the rule was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in 2018. The new administration says it will improve the screening of visitors by strengthening information sharing with foreign governments and other measures. BORDER WALL: Biden is immediately ending the national emergency that Trump declared on the border in February 2018 to divert billions of dollars from the Defense Department to wall construction. He also is halting construction to review contracts and how wall money might be redirected. Despite Trump’s repeated promises that Mexico would pay for the wall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection says Americans have committed $15 billion for more than 700 miles (1,120 kilometers). It is unclear how many miles are under contract and what penalties the government would have to pay for canceling them. The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments Feb. 22 on the legality of Trump’s diverting Defense Department funds for counter-narcotics efforts and military construction projects to wall construction. DACA: Biden will order his Cabinet to work to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the country as young children from deportation since it was introduced in 2012. Trump ordered an end to DACA in 2017, triggering a legal challenge that ended in June when the Supreme Court ruled that it should be kept in place because the Trump administration failed to follow federal rule-making guidelines in undoing it. But DACA is still facing legal challenges. In his presidential proclamation, Biden is calling on Congress to adopt legislation that gives DACA recipients permanent legal status and a path to citizenship. There are currently about 700,000 people enrolled. DEPORTATIONS: Biden is revoking one of Trump’s first executive orders, which declared that all of the roughly 11 million people in the country illegally are considered priorities for deportation. The Department of Homeland Security will conduct a review of enforcement priorities. Biden’s campaign site says deportations will focus on national security and public safety threats. The order says nothing about a 100-day moratorium on deportations that Biden promised during the campaign. Susan Rice, who is tapped to run the White House Domestic Policy Council, says any decision on moratoriums would come from Homeland Security. CENSUS: Biden is reversing a Trump plan to exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the 2020 Census. The once-a-decade census is used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending each year. Biden’s team says the new administration will ensure the Census Bureau has time to complete an accurate count for each state and that the apportionment is “fair and accurate.” ___ Biden is asking the Education Department to extend a pause on federal student loan payments through at least Sept. 30, continuing a moratorium that began early in the pandemic but was set to expire at the end of January. Borrowers, who owe a collective $1.5 trillion, would not be required to make payments on their federal student loans, their loans would not accrue any interest, and all debt collection activity would halt through September. Congress paused student debt payments last March as part of a virus relief package, and the Trump administration extended it twice. Biden’s order does not include the type of mass debt cancellation that some Democrats asked him to orchestrate through executive action. He has said that action should come from Congress. ___ Housing foreclosures and evictions would be delayed until at least March 31, 2021. Almost 12% of homeowners with mortgages are late on their payments, while 19% of renters are behind, according to a Census Bureau survey of households. The federal moratoriums would ensure that people could stay in their homes even if they cannot afford their monthly bills. Biden is also calling on Congress to extend assistance to renters. While the moratoriums have aided several million Americans during the pandemic and helped to contain the disease, they have also meant that billions of dollars in housing costs have gone unpaid. ___ Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Ellen Knickmeyer, Ben Fox, Elliot Spagat, Matt Lee and Josh Boak contributed to this report.

13,Mike Pompeo Insists Multiculturalism Is 'Not Who America Is',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he tweeted that multiculturalism ― in a country that has long celebrated its immigrant heritage ― is “not who America is.” Pompeo appeared to equate multiculturalism with censorship, “political correctness,” “woke-ism” and “all the -isms,” arguing that these ideas actually move America toward authoritarianism. Woke-ism, multiculturalism, all the -isms — they're not who America is. They distort our glorious founding and what this country is all about. Our enemies stoke these divisions because they know they make us weaker. pic.twitter.com/Mu97xCgxfS The former congressman ― who warned that Donald Trump would be “an authoritarian president” back in 2016, prior to becoming a Trump loyalist himself ― was hit with a backlash from other Twitter users. Several pointed to Pompeo’s Italian heritage, arguing that American multiculturalism was precisely what had allowed him to rise to his high position. Mike Pompeo is a disgrace. Multiculturalism is not an “ism” like racism. It’s who we are. E Pluribus Unum (“out of many, one”) appears on the Great Seal of the United States. Glad he’ll be gone tomorrow. https://t.co/nIVE7l968d This country was built on multiculturalism. That’s why a descendant of Italian immigrants like you could become Secretary of State. You should know this history. If you don’t, you should never have been Secretary of State. If you do and you said this anyway, you’re a demagogue. But Secretaty Pompeo in 2021:“multiculturalism....not who America is.”H/T @EenaRuffini https://t.co/k6UnOz4j90 Multiculturalism is my immigrant parents from Hong Kong being invited early on to a Mexican immigrant neighbor's BBQ so they got hooked to tacos and the music of Trío Los Panchos. Just one of the many wondrous things about America. This comment from Secretary Pompeo is trash. https://t.co/4D1gWykxpm When you think about it, you quickly realize that the people complaining about ""cancel culture"" or ""wokeness"" are almost always (1) not actually cancelled (2) obsessively trying to cancel entire groups of people with hate and/or with government spending and/or regulations. America is woke and your kind are being swept out of power.  You are the enemy, and your brand of white nationalism, misogyny and fake Christianity has made us weaker. We start rebuilding in 25 hours.  You lost. You’re a loser.  You’re weak, immoral, impotent and a traitor. You went full fascism. Never go full fascism pic.twitter.com/KQurTpg2zU Mike Pompeo will no longer be Secretary of State tomorrow. Pompeo’s new post was part of a display of Twitter braggadocio that the outgoing secretary of state has embarked upon since the beginning of this year. In other tweets, he has used a false definition of the word “swagger” (“to represent America with pride, humility and professionalism”) to pat himself on the back and suggested that Trump should win a Nobel Prize for his Middle Eastern diplomacy. Despite these boasts, Pompeo was forced to cancel a Europe trip last week after European Union officials declined to meet with him following the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. Pompeo’s rhetorical campaign has caused some to speculate that he may be prepping for a 2024 presidential bid himself. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Pompeo was “well positioned for domestic political pursuits” next, citing supporters close to the secretary of state.

14,Fear Of Deportation Is Keeping Undocumented Immigrants From Seeking Vaccination,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Undocumented U.S. residents are among those hardest hit by COVID-19, and experts and activists are increasingly concerned that vaccines won’t reach their communities. Many experts warn of a public health disaster, citing lack of accessibility, fear of deportation and general wariness, unless a strategy is put in place to communicate with hard-to-reach communities and allow them the opportunity to get vaccinated without risks to them or their families. “The undocumented community has really been disproportionately affected by everything that’s happening with the pandemic,” said Adonia Simpson, director of the Family Defense Program at the Miami-based immigrant-rights group Americans for Immigrant Justice. Hostility toward immigrants by the Trump administration and some lawmakers, as well as fear of possible information sharing with immigration officials, has forced some immigrants underground, even though undocumented immigrants are among those most vulnerable to the coronavirus, Simpson added. Many members of the undocumented community wonder if their status will be a hindrance to receiving the vaccine, or if they’ll be vaccinated at all. In December, New York Gov. Anderew Cuomo (D) successfully lobbied the federal government not to collect personal data as a prerequisite for receiving the vaccine. That quelled the concerns of the state’s nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants who were concerned their status could fall into the hands of federal immigration authorities. “The communities hit hardest by COVID can’t be the last to get a vaccine,” Cuomo said after sending a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “It would be unfair and discriminatory.” But in Nebraska, the sentiment isn’t the same. Earlier this month, Gov. Pete Ricketts was widely criticized by immigration advocates after he announced that “legal citizens” would be prioritized for the vaccine and undocumented workers would have to wait. Nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants reside in the U.S., with hundreds of thousands of them working in essential services, including the food, retail and construction industries. Although no other state appears to have publicly suggested it will consider legal status in its immunization campaign, Nebraska’s plan has heightened fears among undocumented communities across the country. “That type of information spreads really quickly and snowballs, so I do anticipate when vaccines become available to individuals that there’s going to be a continued concern about how this could impact their immigration cases or if their information will be shared or even if they’ll be eligible to get the vaccine,” Simpson said. Advocates are now looking to the Biden administration ― which this week plans to announce an overhaul to the nation’s immigration laws and a pathway to citizenship ― to earn the trust of undocumented immigrants as a part of his promise to vaccinate 100 million people a day during his first 100 days. It is no surprise that millions of undocumented residents are anxious. Almost a year ago, in February 2020, Trump expanded the scope of the “public charge rule”― a seldom-used policy in place since the 1880s that allows the federal government to deny entry to immigrants, especially green card holders, who are deemed to be overly reliant on public benefits, such cash assistance programs. After the change in the public charge rule, immigrants have become hesitant to utilize lifesaving services during the pandemic, such as Medicaid, federal housing, and food aid, for fear of jeopardizing their chances for a green card and citizenship. Simpson noted that some families are not seeking medical services or local assistance for fear of being deported or denied a chance at residency. “The purpose of this rule was really to create confusion and fear, which it was very successful doing,” said Simpson. “It’s just so critically important to keep everybody in mind. This is not a time to be distinguishing between individuals who are documented and undocumented.” A wide array of advocacy organizations have been working to combat disinformation with answers about the Trump rule. “There’s been a lot of mistrust in the government surrounding immigration, so the messaging is just going to have to come from trusted entities on the ground that are working with immigrant communities,” said Simpson. But there still is skepticism. Advocates like Simpson said it is critical for lawmakers and medical professionals to provide clear messaging in various languages to reach undocumented communities and ensure that the vaccine is accessible to them. “It’s just so critically important to keep everybody in mind,” Simpson said. “This is not a time to be distinguishing between individuals who are documented and undocumented. This is a health emergency, which immigration status should play be no factor in this at all.” A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus As COVID-19 cases rise, it’s more important than ever to remain connected and informed.

15,Biden To Propose 8-Year Citizenship Path For Immigrants,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden plans to unveil a sweeping immigration bill on Day One of his administration, hoping to provide an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status, a massive reversal from the Trump administration’s harsh immigration policies. The legislation puts Biden on track to deliver on a major campaign promise important to Latino voters and other immigrant communities after four years of President Donald Trump’s restrictive policies and mass deportations. It provides one of the fastest pathways to citizenship for those living without legal status of any measure in recent years, but it fails to include the traditional trade-off of enhanced border security favored by many Republicans, making passage in a narrowly divided Congress in doubt. Expected to run hundreds of pages, the bill is set to be introduced after Biden takes the oath of office Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the legislation and granted anonymity to discuss it. As a candidate, Biden called Trump’s actions on immigration an “unrelenting assault” on American values and said he would “undo the damage” while continuing to maintain border enforcement. Under the legislation, those living in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, without legal status would have a five-year path to temporary legal status, or a green card, if they pass background checks, pay taxes and fulfill other basic requirements. From there, it’s a three-year path to naturalization, if they decide to pursue citizenship. For some immigrants, the process would be quicker. So-called Dreamers, the young people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children, as well as agricultural workers and people under temporary protective status could qualify more immediately for green cards if they are working, are in school or meet other requirements. The bill is not as comprehensive as the last major immigration overhaul proposed when Biden was vice president during the Obama administration. For example, it does not include a robust border security element, but rather calls for coming up with strategies. Nor does it create any new guest worker or other visa programs. It does address some of the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States, and provides grants for workforce development and English language learning. Biden is expected to take swift executive actions to reverse other Trump immigration actions, including an end to the prohibition on arrivals from several predominantly Muslim countries. During the Democratic primary, Biden consistently named immigration action as one of his “day one” priorities, pointing to the range of executive powers he could invoke to reverse Trump’s policies. Biden allies and even some Republicans have identified immigration as a major issue where the new administration could find common ground with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and enough other GOP senators to avoid the stalemate that has vexed administrations of both parties for decades. That kind of major win — even if it involves compromise — could be critical as Biden looks for legislative victories in a closely divided Congress, where Republicans are certain to oppose other Biden priorities that involve rolling back some of the GOP’s 2017 tax cuts and increasing federal spending. As a candidate, Biden went so far as to say the Obama administration went too far in its aggressive deportations. __ Barrow reported from Wilmington, Del.

0,Biden To Unveil Plan To Offer Legal Status For Millions Of Immigrants,social-justice," SAN DIEGO (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden’s decision to immediately ask Congress to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million people in the country has surprised advocates given how the issue has long divided Democrats and Republicans, even within their own parties. Biden will announce legislation his first day in office to provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the United States illegally, according to four people briefed on his plans. The president-elect campaigned on a path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people in the U.S. illegally, but it was unclear how quickly he would move while wrestling with the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and other priorities. For advocates, memories were fresh of presidential candidate Barack Obama pledging an immigration bill his first year in office, in 2009, but not tackling the issue until his second term. Biden’s plan is the polar opposite of Donald Trump, whose successful 2016 presidential campaign rested in part on curbing or stopping illegal immigration. “This really does represent a historic shift from Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda that recognizes that all of the undocumented immigrants that are currently in the United States should be placed on a path to citizenship,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, who was briefed on the bill. If successful, the legislation would be the biggest move toward granting status to people in the country illegally since President Ronald Reagan bestowed amnesty on nearly 3 million people in 1986. Legislative efforts to overhaul immigration policy failed in 2007 and 2013. Ron Klain, Biden’s incoming chief of staff, said Saturday that Biden will send an immigration bill to Congress “on his first day in office.” He didn’t elaborate and Biden’s office declined to comment on specifics. Advocates were briefed in recent days on the bill’s broad outlines by Esther Olivarria, deputy director for immigration on the White House Domestic Policy Council. Domingo Garcia, former president of the League of Latin American Citizens, said Biden told advocates on a call Thursday that Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate may delay consideration of the bill and that they shouldn’t count on passage within 100 days. “I was pleasantly surprised that they were going to take quick action because we got the same promises from Obama, who got elected in ’08, and he totally failed,” Garcia said. Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum and among those briefed Thursday night, said immigrants would be put on an eight-year path to citizenship. There would be a faster track for those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields people from deportation who came to the country as young children, and Temporary Protected Status, which gives temporary status to hundreds of thousands of people from strife-torn countries, many from El Salvador. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris offered similar remarks in an interview with Univision that aired Tuesday, saying DACA and TPS recipients will “automatically get green cards” while others would be on an eight-year path to citizenship. More favorable attitudes toward immigration — especially among Democrats — may weigh in Biden’s favor this time.  A Gallup survey last year found that 34% of those polled favored more immigration, up from 21% in 2016 and higher than any time since it began asking the question in 1965. The survey found 77% felt immigration was good for the country on the whole, up slightly from 72% in 2016. Noorani said the separation of more than 5,000 children from the parents at the border, which peaked in 2018, alienated voters from Trump’s policies, particularly conservatives and evangelicals. He believes a constantly shifting outlook for DACA recipients also hurt Trump among people who felt he was using them as “political pawns.” “What was seared in their mind was family separation. They took it out on the Republican Party in 2018 and they took it out on Trump in 2020,” Noorani said. “To put a really fine point on it, they want to end the cruelty of the Trump administration.” It is impossible to know precisely how many people are in the country illegally. Pew Research Center estimates  there were 10.5 million in 2017, down from an all-time high of 12.2 million in 2007. The Homeland Security Department estimates there were 12 million people in the country illegally in 2015, nearly 80% of them for more than 10 years. More than half were Mexican. ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Democrats Call For Fast-Tracking Citizenship For Undocumented Essential Workers,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) and Sen.-designate Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) are pushing for undocumented essential workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic to be fast-tracked for U.S. citizenship. “History will remember them as American heroes,” Padilla said on a press call Friday, speaking of undocumented people working in agriculture, health care, grocery stores and more during the pandemic. “We have an obligation to treat them as essential,” added Padilla, who will take Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ Senate seat in California after she’s inaugurated. Padilla’s own parents came to the U.S. from Mexico in the 1960s and worked in restaurants and house cleaning. Castro said he’s working on legislation to immediately protect undocumented essential workers from deportation and speed up their path to citizenship. Castro, the former chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, is hoping to get it passed as part of the next coronavirus relief package after President-elect Joe Biden takes office. “These are people who feed us, clean our homes and hospitals and offices… and they do all this while living in fear of deportation, exploitation and now of this pandemic,” Castro said, noting that many who work in meatpacking, farm work and other front-line industries don’t have the option to work from home, and their employers don’t provide them with paid sick leave. The proposed protections would apply to an estimated 5 million workers out of a total of over 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., said Lorella Praeli, president of the advocacy group Community Change Action. Essential workers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, are American heroes—risking their lives during COVID to serve our nation.I’m working on a bill to immediately protect essential workers and their families from deportation and provide them a fast-track to citizenship. Undocumented essential workers braved harsh conditions on farms, in packed meat factories, and took buses to clean homes, offices, and medical facilities. It's time to offer these essential community members a pathway to citizenship in the next COVID bill. Undocumented immigrants are among those hardest hit by the pandemic since they are disproportionately represented among workers deemed “essential” — from farmworkers to building cleaners — who are risking their lives while millions of Americans stay home. Meanwhile, undocumented immigrants were excluded from Congress’ relief packages, as they were made ineligible for stimulus checks. They’re also not eligible for unemployment benefits. As the coronavirus surges, Latinx and Black people are around four times as likely to be hospitalized as white people, and nearly three times as likely to die, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Last month, France fast-tracked citizenship processes for hundreds of immigrant front-line workers, including health care workers, garbage collectors, housekeepers and cashiers. Earlier this week, dozens of U.S. lawmakers signed a letter led by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus applauding Biden’s commitment to immigration reform and urging him to take immediate action, given that the presidency and both houses of Congress will soon be in Democrats’ hands. “History will remember them as American heroes.” Padilla said he and Castro plan to get the 5 million undocumented essential workers fast-tracked for citizenship as part of the next coronavirus relief bill and then work toward a broader path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants in a later immigration reform bill. “Knowing the urgency of COVID relief, it seems there’s a quick and easy way to get a good number of these [people] protected sooner rather than later,” Padilla said on Friday’s press call. The incoming California senator said he and Castro have been speaking with the Biden-Harris administration and plan to talk with House and Senate leaders soon. The offices of Biden’s transition team, as well as Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is set to become Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Biden and Harris’ platform includes a commitment to work with Congress to pass legislation to create a path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Greisa Martínez Rosas, head of the immigrant rights group United We Dream, said the organization supports Castro and Padilla’s proposal and demands “that Congress uses every avenue possible to pass policies that include a pathway to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants.” The process for undocumented workers to gain legal status in the U.S. can be complicated and take years. In terms of what advocates are hoping “fast-tracking” citizenship would look like in this case, Angelica Salas, executive director of immigrant rights group CHIRLA, said that the legislation would first be debated promptly as part of the next coronavirus relief package. Then eligible immigrants would receive green cards, granting them permanent residency and protection from deportation, after which they could apply for citizenship after a few years. Patrice Lawrence, co-director of the immigrant-led organization UndocuBlack Network, said legislation recognizing immigrants’ “humanity and our contributions to this country is long overdue” and that a bill protecting undocumented essential workers is “the bare minimum this country can do.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Trump’s Legacy Through The Eyes Of Those His Presidency Hurt,social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost Senior reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost Environment Reporter, HuffPost One week into his term, President Donald Trump devastated tens of thousands of people with the stroke of a pen. Throughout the campaign, Trump had vowed to enact a Muslim ban. His fifth executive order effectively made good on that promise, banning people from seven countries — all majority-Muslim — from entering the United States. Immediate chaos followed. People were stranded at airports. Families were kept apart. Refugees set to finally find safety in the U.S. after years of navigating international bureaucracies were abruptly abandoned. That day proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. For the next four years, Trump followed up with policies, actions and comments that were tremendously painful for hundreds of thousands of people. That suffering was borne primarily by minorities and people of color: Latinos he demonized, Black people he denigrated for protesting against racism and brutality, Muslims he continually attacked, transgender people he licensed discrimination against, Asian Americans he insulted. Trump separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents in a policy that will go down in history as among the cruelest actions of his administration. He downplayed the coronavirus pandemic, which has thus far killed at least 375,000 Americans. Trump riled up supporters in opposition to his perceived foes: Democrats, particularly women of color such as Rep. Ilhan Omar; whistleblowers such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; election workers who he suggested were part of a massive fraud campaign; public health workers who pushed for more safety precautions to stop the spread of COVID-19. He defended white nationalist protesters as “very fine people” after they descended on Charlottesville, Virginia. He called Haiti and African nations “shithole countries,” a view he would have followed up with action to decrease immigration had he won support from Congress. He insulted the women who accused him of sexual assault. He encouraged supporters to overturn the election in statements that led to an insurrection at the Capitol last week, a move that led to him being impeached for a second time on Wednesday. The Trump era will be remembered for many things, including corruption and extremism. For many people, it will also be remembered as a time of immense pain — a time when the nation’s highest power, a man purportedly the president to all Americans, turned his aim on them. We asked 14 people to share with us, in their own words, what it was like to live through it. Jessica Drake, an adult film actor, director and sex educator, accused Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent in 2006. She also said Trump offered her $10,000 to have sex with him at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament. Trump called her allegations “total fiction,” and his campaign continually smeared her character to undermine her claim. He later insinuated that Drake’s accusation didn’t matter because she was an adult film actor. It was terrifying [coming forward with my story], and it wasn’t a decision I made overnight. I understood that it would alter the course of my life significantly. However, it was extremely important to me that I speak out and share my personal experience prior to the election. When his campaign denied my claims, it was frustrating yet expected ― I knew that was their method. When he was doing a New Hampshire radio interview and said: “One [woman] said, ‘He grabbed me on the arm.’ And she’s a porn star… Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before.” That infuriated me. His dismissal of my claims being based on my occupation was unfair. At first, when he won the election, I felt like nothing I had said or did mattered. I was devastated. Today, his fan base continues to hate me. I get hateful messages on social media. Some folks have thanked me. Some of the other women who came out against him have reached out to me in support. For me, the decision to speak out was a fork in the road of my life. I had always been somewhat of an activist, but coming forward set me on a path I won’t turn back from. ― As told to Alanna Vagianos Trump made good on his promise for “a total and complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the United States when he signed an executive order banning foreign nationals from several predominately Muslim countries. Since then, the ban has been challenged in courts, upheld by the Supreme Court, revised, and expanded. Thousands of people were separated from their families, missing weddings and funerals, education and work opportunities, and denied seeing their loved ones for years. Among them was Mina Mahdavi, a 39-year-old solutions and cybersecurity engineer in California who has not been able to bring her mother from Iran to the U.S. because of the Muslim ban. My mom is an avid traveler. I used to live in Canada and she visited me in Canada. She traveled all over Europe. She visited me here in the U.S. twice. And then, in 2016, I decided to have a kid, and I was planning to have my mom with me. My son was born in May 2017, and I was still in denial. I thought, there’s a waiver process, we can ask for a waiver. She’s gonna make it. Maybe not the first couple of months, but she’s gonna make it. And then, after it got rejected like 15, 16 months later, it sort of settled in — I can’t have my mom here. Period. I went through depression. It’s hard. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s hard. At first, I was still hopeful. I was thinking, maybe not now, but she’s going to come. Not today, but she was going to come like next week. She even packed her stuff. She was ready. The moment that she would get the visa, she would just fly. And then she sort of started unpacking, I guess, after a while. I still see people in the park with their grandkids ― a grandma or grandpa — and I don’t know why I don’t have it. Why my kid doesn’t have that? I’m still crying. It’s been four years. ― As told to Rowaida Abdelaziz Trump announced in a series of tweets that he planned to ban transgender people from serving in the military in “any capacity.” The controversial policy, implemented on April 12, 2019, stated that trans people are only allowed to enlist in the military under the sex they were assigned at birth. The policy effectively banned transgender people from enlisting in the military, while forcing current trans service members who had already transitioned back into the closet. Brock Stone, an 11-year Navy veteran and transgender man, was one of those affected by Trump’s ban. The 37-year-old is one of several plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration over its ban on transgender service members. I remember being terrified. I didn’t know how quickly it would all happen. I didn’t know what the legal procedure would be. It was the commander in chief saying this. Does he give the order and then I fill out my paperwork and I’m out in 30 days and I hope I can find a job quickly? I had no idea. Of all of my feelings, I never wished I hadn’t come out. It was more anger that I had gained that visibility and they were trying to erase me. They weren’t telling me to detransition, they were telling me: Go away. This wasn’t just a job to me. At the time, I took quite a bit of pride in being part of the military. It felt like I was part of something bigger than myself. It wasn’t a religious experience for me, but it was kind of a crisis of faith. It was a big chunk of my reality turned on its head. I remember when I was approached to join the lawsuit. I initially had said I needed to think about it. Ultimately, I thought, I can wait for somebody else to do this for me or I can do it myself. Now I know I did what I should’ve done. ― As told to Alanna Vagianos During the weekend of Aug. 11, 2017, white nationalists descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, for the “Unite the Right” rally. The crowd, which chanted racist and anti-Semitic statements, included neo-Nazis and members of other extremist hate groups. A man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters demonstrating against hate in their city, and a woman named Heather Heyer was killed. On Aug. 12, Trump addressed the violence by stating, “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides.” He defended the comments on Aug. 15, saying, “You have people who are very fine people on both sides” and claiming he was referring to people protesting against removing monuments to Confederates and racists. Lisa Woolfork, an anti-racist organizer in Charlottesville, reflects on what those comments signified. I was at the intersection when the white supremacist drove his car through the crowd. What I remember was hearing a loud bang. And then I saw a shoe in the air about 20 feet above me. It was chaos. Absolute chaos. [Trump’s comments were] in the immediate aftermath. We hadn’t even fully parsed what had happened. I remember standing here at our house in the living room, and my husband had read his statement aloud, I heard it. And I felt chills. I felt like someone had thrown a bucket of ice cold water over my head, and it was dripping down my body. I felt such rage. This was adding insult to injury. We had already had an injury. And the president of the United States piled on the insults. And it was an announcement that reflected everything that we had long known about this administration: that they had chosen their side and they were speaking to their base, which is a racist, white supremacist, fascist spirit that has infected American democracy. This is also the outcome of when you don’t acknowledge that American democracy has always had at its core a form of racism and white supremacy. This administration dispensed with the need for dog whistles, and then just shouts it from a bullhorn. You cannot unring a bell. You cannot. ― As told to Elise Foley Trump announced he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, an Obama-era policy that granted temporary work permits and deportation reprieve to about 800,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as kids. He was later blocked in court. One of these so-called Dreamers was Gabriela Cruz, a 31-year-old who lives in Santa Cruz, California, and now works for the advocacy group United We Dream and its political arm, United We Dream Action. I was so numb that day. I couldn’t process what was happening. I immigrated to the country when I was only a year old, so I’ve been here for 30 years. I didn’t get DACA until I was 23 years old. And so for me, I’d built a whole career. I had finally found stability in my life where I wasn’t fearful anymore. At work I told myself, just keep it together to 5 p.m. and then afterward, you can cry, you can do whatever you feel like you need to do. I had never really been to a protest. But I wanted to be around people. I made this huge sign that said “Santa Cruz Dreamer.” And that was the first time that I ever called myself that. It actually ended up being the first day I actually shared my story out loud in public. The last four years have been just so horrible. It’s taken a toll on me mentally, physically. Now, I feel like I can finally take care of myself again. I couldn’t do that the last four years because I was fighting for my life. ― As told to Elise Foley In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the implementation of Trump’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy. The order separated migrant children from their parents who were detained when they entered the U.S., causing a national uproar after photos of traumatized young children screaming and crying went public. After mounting pressure from lawmakers and advocates, Trump signed an executive order ending the policy a year later. Javier Garrido, 33, an immigrant from Honduras, crossed into the U.S. with his son. He was separated from his son, who was 4 at the time, for three months. I left fleeing for my life. It was in 2018. I left my country in March. I turned myself in at the bridge to ask for help. They detained me for three days when they separated me from my son. They took him from me. They left me at the border, over in Texas, and they took my son to New York. That was painful. I never thought they’d take him from me. If I’d have known, I would have stayed and faced the violence in my country, rather than have them take my son. When they took him, the first thing the officer told me was that they were going to put him up for adoption for a family here in the United States. That was painful. If I’d have known that they would take away my kid like that, I wouldn’t have come. It went on for three months, me in one place and my son in another. They told me they would deport me along with my child, but I said, “I don’t care, as long as I get to see him. I’m going to Honduras. And later I’ll find some way to go to another country. But I want my son.” The day [we reunited] was the happiest day of my life, as happy as the day my son was born. I was so happy when they gave him back to me because my head had been spinning, wondering whether they would give him back or not, or whether a family here would end up adopting him. It’s the saddest thing they can do, to separate someone from their family. I don’t wish it on anyone. I don’t think they should do it. Better to send them back together if someone comes here with their family, but don’t split them up because that’s painful. I spent about two months knowing nothing about my son, I didn’t know where he was, I didn’t know anything. I had to call family in Honduras, so they could try to figure out where my son was. I don’t wish this upon anyone. ― As told to Rowaida Abdelaziz The U.S. government came to a screeching halt in late December 2018. It remained remain shuttered for 35 days after Trump demanded Congress carve out in its appropriations bill nearly $6 billion to fund his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed and another roughly 420,000 were expected to continue working with their pay delayed until the shutdown ended. An estimated 1.2 million federal contractors ― including 31-year-old Ashante Clay of Virginia ― were also impacted. And while many of these workers received back pay once the government reopened, the stress of trying to make ends meet in the interim had lasting impacts for some. It was pretty scary. It was like I was employed one week and then I just wasn’t employed the next. I’m a single mom, so I still had day care and all my bills to pay. I was on unemployment for like three or four months. I was job searching outside of the government. After two government shutdowns with my company, it just didn’t seem like the field to be working in. It was just too volatile. To say it was overwhelming would be an understatement. I didn’t expect to ever lose my job. I wasn’t prepared, and I was just barely making it with day care and bills and everything. Losing that income ― it was really stressful. I did not want a border wall and I was very, very upset that something that’s so terribly discriminatory and racist, something I didn’t even want or support, cost me my job. And the people who were making these decisions did not care that their squabbling with each other was having real-life consequences to working people like myself. I don’t really follow a lot of the political chatter ― it’s just kind of too much ― but I never heard any lawmakers or anybody who was in support of the wall talking about the people who were losing their jobs or not being able to pay their bills just because of this border wall. ― As told to Hayley Miller On April 13, 2019, Trump tweeted out a video falsely suggesting that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who just five months earlier had become the first Somali American and one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress, had tried to justify the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Trump has since made Omar one of the most consistent targets of his racist and Islamophobic rhetoric, repeatedly saying she should “go back” to Somalia, where a civil war made her a refugee as a child. At his rallies, crowds of his fans have chanted “Send her back” about Omar. In November 2019, a Trump supporter pleaded guilty to making death threats against the congresswoman; Omar wrote to the sentencing judge asking him to be compassionate in his decision. Despite proof of the impact of his own vitriol ― which prompted investigations by both the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police ― Trump has continued smearing Omar, apparently seeing it as politically useful to elevate his feud with the first member of Congress to wear a Muslim headscarf. Speaking in her home state weeks before the presidential election, Trump claimed that Omar “tells us how to run our country,” making it clear he does not see her as an equal American. This week, Omar helped lead the charge to impeach the president a second time for inciting a mob to invade Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. [On Jan. 6] we saw the violent consequences of Trump’s violent rhetoric. Every Member of Congress, staff member, and Capitol worker saw how violent and dangerous the leader of our country can be. Sadly, I have known the danger of this since I took office, as Trump’s words have resulted in thousands of threats on my life. I do not worry for myself, but I worry about the consequences of this violent rhetoric on our fragile republic. I worry about the people in my district and around the world who share my identities. I worry about the little Ilhans sitting in refugee camps around the world who will not have the opportunity to come to this country because of his refugee policies. I worry about the Black children who won’t have a stable home because of Trump’s efforts to resegregate housing. I worry about the child who is separated from her mother because of Trump’s cruel immigration policies. The legacy of this hatred will continue for decades and it is up to all of us to ensure that this ideology can never hold power in our republic again. ― As told to Akbar Shahid Ahmed Trump campaigned on a promise to build a “big beautiful wall” along the southern border ― one that he insisted Mexico would foot the bill for. Four years later, more than 400 miles of border wall have been built, most of it replacement of smaller existing barriers, without Mexico paying a dime of the $15 billion price tag. In its rushed effort, the Trump administration has waived numerous environmental laws and forever altered the southern border. In February 2020, the Trump administration began bulldozing and blasting sites within Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a UNESCO biosphere reserve that is home to numerous endangered species, to make way for Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The sites included cultural and burial sites sacred to the Tohono O’odham and other Native American tribes. Along with that damage, migration routes for jaguars and other species have been cut off, fragile ecosystems damaged, whole mountains sliced in half. Laiken Jordahl, a former wilderness fellow at the National Park Service, has been documenting the environmental damage in the borderlands, including Organ Pipe, as a campaigner at the left-leaning Center for Biological Diversity. I spent Trump’s Inauguration Day wandering through a cactus forest in Organ Pipe National Monument, just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. At 26 years old, I’d landed my dream job: working with the National Park Service to protect Arizona’s stunning wilderness lands for generations to come. But as Trump was sworn in, I worried that he’d make good on his racist border wall promise and destroy so much of the wilderness I was charged with protecting. And even though Trump’s plan to build a wall across the southern border was clearly the biggest threat facing Organ Pipe, I was told not to discuss, research or write about the horrific destruction a wall would cause. It was just “too political.” Years later, I find myself returning to Organ Pipe almost every week, but not as a park service employee. Now I return with a bullhorn and media crews. In the past year, Trump has dynamited sacred Indigenous sites, butchered hundreds of ancient saguaro cactuses, and pulverized swaths of wildlife habitat to build the wall along the monument’s southern border. I’ve done everything I can to raise the alarm as this ecological catastrophe unfolds before my eyes, but I can’t help but feel like I failed to protect Organ Pipe. The wall through the monument is nearly complete. I’ve become a disaster tour guide. It’s heartbreaking. The damage Trump’s border wall has inflicted is incalculable. Much of it will last forever. ― As told to Chris D’Angelo While insisting the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. wasn’t his fault, Trump turned to a common scapegoat: China. The president repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as “China virus,” “kung flu” and “Wuhan virus.” Viruses are no longer named after places because of the potential for harm for nations and people. Asian Americans reported a swell of hate incidents related to the coronavirus. James Chen, a 45-year-old Taiwanese American small business owner in Queens, New York, said the president’s rhetoric amplified the xenophobia and that his business faced a double whammy — a financial loss incurred by the pandemic lockdown and a bias that unfairly led customers away. I’m proud to be a Chinese, Asian American in this country. So when [Trump] used the word “China virus,” I wasn’t too happy about it. I felt like it was very discriminatory. Asian Americans, especially Chinese Americans, are being discriminated against. I felt this way when I was out on Long Island, during the beginning of the pandemic. I was out wearing a mask in Rite Aid, and I felt other people being uncomfortable [with my presence] and they looked at me very weird. I wanted to say I’m protecting you guys, but unfortunately, it’s what it is. Everyone is being affected in some way. I lost my aunt last year, due to coronavirus. A lot of people have lost or knew someone who passed away from coronavirus. Asian Americans, especially Chinese Americans in this country, take the coronavirus very, very seriously. During the beginning of this pandemic, they were the first ones to wear a mask. They are the first ones to shut down their businesses, the first ones to sanitize their business. We want to stop the spread. Don’t put this tag on us — Asian virus or China virus. It’s really unfair. ― As told to Rowaida Abdelaziz A week after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, thousands of people, led by Black Lives Matter organizers, showed up at the gates of the White House to protest racism and police brutality. Trump directed law enforcement to tear-gas and launch rubber bullets at the peaceful protesters so he could walk to the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church just a few blocks away. Once there, he posed with a Bible for a photo-op and said, “Greatest country in the world. And we’re going to keep it safe.” Melina Abdullah, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, was watching in horror from across the country. The idea that Black Lives Matter organizers were out to protest police brutality and Trump used police brutality to silence those protesters ― it was a reminder of how deeply entrenched police violence is in this country. Trump’s photo-op and the police crackdown on protesters was just days after [the death of] George Floyd. Those who want to maintain an oppressive and racist regime are perhaps most threatened by the organizing component. That’s where I think you see the call for police violence against protesters ― it’s because Trump was threatened by the protest. The lesson for us is we can’t give up the protest, even in the midst of a pandemic. We have to both vote and organize. We have to engage in both protest and politics. We don’t just organize to vote. When we vote folks into office, we also have to ensure that they carry the agendas of the folks who voted them in. I feel so relieved knowing that Trump is leaving office. We’re not under the illusion that just because Biden and Harris are in the White House, all of a sudden Black freedom comes. There’s no illusion there. But Donald Trump was absolutely the most oppressive, repressive, racist, sexist, violent so-called leader we could have. So I am relieved to see him go. I think the whole world is exhaling. We’re all sharing a collective sigh of relief. ― As told to Alanna Vagianos The Justice Department and election officials nationwide have stated repeatedly that there’s no evidence widespread voter fraud occurred during the 2020 election, and yet Trump has continued to falsely claim for months that the Democrats “rigged” the process against him. He’s been especially critical of mail-in voting, making unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud and whipping his base into a frenzy. As CEO of the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute, Amber McReynolds has spent the last two years helping state and local election officials across the country expand and secure their vote-by-mail systems. She’s been the target of constant harassment online in recent months amid Trump’s whirlwind of misinformation about mail-in ballots. In the weeks after the election is when the death threats started. I had tweets directed at me [with] a picture of a noose saying that I should be hung for treason and executed for being a traitor. There was one tweet that had a picture of my kids in it, which was the one that really disturbed me the most. They got pretty bad, to where we actually hired off-duty police officers to be stationed outside my house for three or four weeks. My election official friends have been targeted in unprecedented ways this year, and they’re just trying to do their jobs. I’m running a nonprofit now and I understand people aren’t always going to agree with what we’re trying to do, but ultimately all we’re trying to do is improve the election process for every single American and make sure it’s safe, secure and accessible. The election officials, my heart breaks for them because they’re already under a very stressful situation and to have them get death threats or be followed to their cars or be harassed online or doxed on social media ― it’s just unbelievable. I just never in my wildest dreams would have expected that an elected official ― at any level ― would do what has happened, not only with the president but also local officials and state legislators who have pushed these crazy conspiracies not based in fact. I just never expected that to occur in the United States of America. ― As told to Hayley Miller Trump downplayed the threat of COVID-19 from the get-go, repeatedly peddling misinformation about its transmission and mocking people who wore masks. His divisive and baseless rhetoric fired up supporters, some of whom staged armed protests against state and local officials making decisions about coronavirus mitigation measures. Ada County Commissioner Diana Lachiondo of Idaho, a member of her district’s public health board, was the target of one such protest. She tearfully excused herself from a health board meeting on a potential mask mandate after she learned protesters were surrounding her house. Her two children were home alone. At the time, I thought it was just my 12-year-old, but it turns out it was my 12-year-old and my 8-year-old. He was upset and I just felt really helpless. I had to get home to my son. He’s scared. There’s people outside our door and I don’t know what’s going on. … I just can’t believe where we’ve come to as a community and as a country, really. It’s just ― it’s sad. I’ll tell you the most frustrating thing is that I get a weekly report from the White House coronavirus task force with recommendations about what we should be doing from a mitigation standpoint. At one point, [task force member] Deborah Birx herself was on the phone with just me and the health board member from our neighboring county, and she wasn’t calling because we were doing so great over here; she was imploring us to take measures. Simultaneously, we’re watching the president fan the flames of some of this rhetoric against the governor of Michigan and just in general. The disconnect between what his own task force was asking us to do and these weekly White House reports and then what he was doing ... was incredibly frustrating. I, at this point, feel like it’s had real consequences for my family. That’s not leadership. ― As told to Hayley Miller Trump ― through his incessant false claims of voter fraud ― for weeks sowed defiance and distrust of the election results among his base. On Jan. 6, he addressed thousands of his supporters in Washington, D.C., and called on them to march on the U.S. Capitol. Many of them heeded his orders, forcing their way into the building. The violence resulted in at least five deaths, including a police officer who died after a pro-Trump rioter bludgeoned him in the head with a fire extinguisher. Because of the pandemic, Justin Goldberger, a senior policy adviser to Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), was working from home when the insurrectionists began storming the Capitol. He frantically called and texted his colleagues who were inside as he watched the insurrectionists attempt to overthrow the seat of the nation’s government. Symbols of hate, including the Confederate flag and neo-Nazi iconography, were paraded through the Capitol. Goldberger — a co-chair of the Congressional Jewish Staffers Association whose boss is the third Black congressman ever to represent Virginia — found them particularly hard to see. You see your place of work turn into a war zone. There’s tear gas, there are protesters, and you’re frantically texting your colleagues and just making sure that they’re OK. It’s tough because every minute you don’t hear back, you’re wondering. The toughest part is seeing a place you’re so familiar with, and you see every day and have all these memories in, just kind of implode. You saw people quoting Hitler. You saw Nazi paraphernalia. And not even from a Jewish perspective, but I work for a [Congressional Black Caucus] member ― you saw nooses hung up. And just seeing that was I think equally as jarring and just disheartening, not only as a Capitol Hill staffer but just as an American. Personally, do I think that some institutions probably incentivized or didn’t at least do their part to stop this? Absolutely. … On the opposite side, seeing us go back to work right afterward and say, you know, we’re not going to let this affect our timeline for making sure democracy runs its course was equally as heartening. ― As told to Hayley Miller Responses have been lightly edited for clarity.

3,"Jeff Sessions, Rod Rosenstein Blindsided Prosecutors With Family Separation Policy",social-justice," Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his then-top deputy, Rod Rosenstein, pushed a “zero tolerance” policy that led to immigrant family separations in spite of concerns raised by top federal prosecutors on the border, who were caught off guard by the decision, according to a new Justice Department watchdog report. Sessions knew at the time of their decision that it would lead to families being separated, but he and his top officials made massive assumptions about how long that process would take, according to the report. Those assumptions were inconsistent with the realities on the ground. Sessions and Rosenstein refused to adjust their views, even when they were more informed about how the process would play out and knew it would mean ripping young children away from their families. After some U.S. Attorneys on the border expressed their concerns, they were ordered to move forward with prosecutions. This had enormous implications. The family separation policy split at least 5,400 immigrant children from their parents, according to American Civil Liberties Union, although advocates believe the number may be higher. Those kids included infants who were still breastfeeding, toddlers and other small children. All of them went through immense trauma, often adding to pain and fear they’d experienced in their native countries, which many were fleeing to seek asylum, and on the journey to the U.S. In some cases, the government failed to keep records on where the children went. Some of these families were never reunited. Sessions and Justice Department leadership, the report said, were operating under the belief that separation, prosecution, sentencing and reunification could take place within the span of an afternoon. Justice Department leadership did not consult the U.S. Marshals Service, federal defenders or federal courts before they made the decision. There is no evidence that Rosenstein was aware of some of the early discussion around the policy, but he supported and enforced Sessions’ decision. Rosenstein, who spent his Justice Department career in the greater Washington, D.C., region, appeared gravely naive about the realities on the ground involved in prosecuting so many low-level cases. “My thought was maybe we just release [the defendant] back to DHS and they can just hold the kid for a few hours while the parent was in court, and then they would be back together that night,” he said. Gene Hamilton, the counselor to the attorney general, also believed they would be able to reunited families in a few hours, according to the report. “It was our understanding that prosecution would happen in an afternoon or in days, [that a child would remain] in DHS custody and then there would be reunification with the children,” Hamilton said. “We didn’t ever imagine DHS would lose track of the kids and their location. Like sending children off to a shelter in New Jersey. That was not our understanding at all.” After reviewing a draft of the report, Rosenstein had second thoughts. “I had this false sense of security that DHS has this under control,” he said. ”[After] the AG had rolled this out, my understanding was it was coordinated with DHS, who handled [the way in which] children are going to be taken care of. … And so I had this false sense of security that I’m just doing what I can to provide logistical support and obviously, looking at it in retrospect, I have a very different perspective.” Officials in President Donald Trump’s administration either cheered on the policy as a way to deter unauthorized immigration or looked the other way. The Justice Department began to split up families in 2017, but announced its “zero tolerance” policy more broadly in April 2018. In May, at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, officials decided to move ahead with the policy in a show-of-hands vote, NBC News reported. DOJ began to dramatically ramp up prosecution for illegal entry among parents who crossed the border with children. Under past administrations, such as that of President Barack Obama, families that crossed the border illegally had not typically been charged with a crime, but rather put in immigration proceedings. Sessions and other officials claimed it wasn’t about separating families. Instead, they insisted it was no different than splitting parents from their children when they went to jail for another reason. But the policy wasn’t just about prosecuting crime; it was about taking away kids as a way to prevent parents from coming to the U.S. The administration began considering it a means of deterring families from coming to the border as early as March 2017. The same month, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly confirmed publicly that such a plan was under consideration, also noting the need for deterrence. Sessions was heavily involved, as the inspector general’s office found. When the five U.S. attorneys along the U.S.-Mexico border raised concerns about children’s welfare, Sessions dismissed them, The New York Times reported in October based on a draft of the report. “We need to take away children,” Sessions told the prosecutors, according to participants’ notes, the Times reported. Rosenstein later said that the children’s ages didn’t matter. After intense public outrage, Trump signed an executive order in June 2018 to end the practice, and then took credit for doing so — even though his administration started it in the first place. Neither Sessions nor Rosenstein is still serving in the Trump administration. Sessions was eventually forced out after the 2018 election because Trump didn’t like his handling of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rosenstein stepped down in May 2019, after the release of the the special counsel’s report.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Andra Day Is Billie Holiday In Chilling Trailer For New Hulu Biopic,social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Audiences on Monday got a first look at Andra Day as Billie Holiday with the release of the first trailer for a hotly anticipated biopic. Directed by Lee Daniels, “The United States vs. Billie Holiday” takes an intimate look at the legendary jazz vocalist. The film is billed as a portrait of a “fierce trailblazer whose defiance through music helped usher in the civil rights movement” and had been intended for a theatrical run before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. It now is slated for a Feb. 26 release on Hulu. “Whether you are new to the story and legacy of Billie Holiday or know every note she ever sang, I do hope our celebration of this complex woman does justice to a great musical legend and civil rights activist whose artistry resonates as well today, as it did 80 years ago,” Daniels, whose credits include the 2009 film “Precious” and the Fox TV series “Empire,” said in a press release. “Hulu releasing this film and giving it a platform to be seen nationwide is a blessing, because as recent events reveal, our country has much work to do in fulfilling its promise of a more perfect union.” Holiday rose to fame in Harlem’s nightclub scene and, in 1938, became one of the first Black women to front an all-white band. Her recordings of songs like “God Bless the Child” and “I’ll Be Seeing You” remain standards. With a screenplay by Suzan-Lori Parks, “The United States vs. Billie Holiday” focuses primarily on the creation of Holiday’s 1939 song about lynching, “Strange Fruit,” which made her a target for the FBI. The film, which also stars Trevante Rhodes and Natasha Lyonne, marks Day’s first significant acting role. The California-born singer-songwriter received a Grammy nomination for her 2015 debut album, “Cheers to the Fall.” Holiday died from drug and alcohol-related complications in 1959 at age 44. She was memorably portrayed by Diana Ross in 1972’s “Lady Sings the Blues.” In 2014, actor Audra McDonald won a Tony Award for playing Holiday in Broadway’s “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill,” and two years later, received an Emmy nomination for the role when that production was filmed for an HBO broadcast. In an interview published Monday, Day said she strove to portray Holiday as not having a “victim mentality.” “She was Black, at that time in this country, period, but she was not a victim in the mind,” she told V Magazine. “I hope this is a revelation.” Watch the trailer for “The United States vs. Billie Holiday” below.

11,White Terror Has Always Been America’s Answer,social-justice," Erin E. Evans is senior enterprise editor of culture at HuffPost. They’d lost their power and wanted a return to normalcy. They stood back and they stood by as they carefully planned an insurrection to attempt to regain control. They turned to violence in an effort to “make America great again.” This was the case for pro-Trump rioters in 2021. It was also the case for white supremacists in Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1898, in America’s first and only successful coup d’etat. During the Reconstruction era, a period lasting about a decade after the Civil War until 1877, biracial governments came to power in cities across the South. Still reeling from defeat of the Confederacy, Southern Democrats often retaliated against this new power structure. On Nov. 10, 1898, a mob of white men marched on City Hall in Wilmington with their pistols and rifles to overthrow the local government and remove Black and white political leaders from their posts. They were successful. White supremacists took over. The mob destroyed Black-owned businesses, including the town’s Black newspaper. Dozens of Black residents ended up dead. “What happened in Wilmington became an affirmation of white supremacy not just in that one city, but in the South and in the nation as a whole,” author Laura Edwards wrote in “Democracy Betrayed: The Wilmington Race Riot In 1898 And Its Legacy.” This is the United States today: President Donald Trump, who has espoused racist rhetoric since he first announced his candidacy in 2015, lost his reelection after historic turnout and voter mobilization efforts. His refusal to accept the results of a fair and free election, as well as his spread of lies and conspiracy theories about election fraud, emboldened his base to besiege the U.S. Capitol building, riot on its steps, fire bullets in its halls and terrorize elected officials. For a few tumultuous hours, the mob stood in the way of Congress certifying the 2020 election results and officially starting a peaceful transfer of power. At least four people reportedly died Wednesday in the chaos, and dozens more were injured. Nooses, unambiguous symbols of mob mentality and racial terror against Black Americans, were strung up on the Capitol grounds to remind everyone exactly what the rioters stood for — and who they stood against. It was an apt end to a presidency fueled by white backlash to racial progress, as Georgia turned blue for the first time in 28 years, as the state voted to send its first Black senator to Washington, as Kamala Harris prepared to take her place as vice president. Many saw this coming. The rioters had been planning in plain sight. But perhaps Black Americans were the least surprised by the day’s events. The precedent had been set, time and again. We don’t have to look back that far for reminders: Whether in 1900, or 1925, or 1939, or 1965, or 2020, white terror has been deeply embedded in American culture, especially in the face of Black progress and the quest for freedom and equality. Several politicos and pundits from both sides of the aisle returned to familiar refrains like “this isn’t America” and that riots don’t “represent who we are.” Yet history tells us another story. For more than a century, Black Americans have documented and warned us of similar moments where racial terror and white supremacy were the status quo. Several instances — often left out of history books and school curricula — illustrate this narrative. They show a desire to undermine the ideals of our democracy, and demonstrate the hypocrisy in how police respond to Black protest and white lawlessness. “Those who resist change are reminiscent of the ex-Confederates who, in the years following the Civil War, preferred to dream of a South that never was and never could be rather than accept one that was within the reach of all, if they would join together and make it so,” historian John Hope Franklin wrote in the foreword for “Democracy Betrayed” in 1998. “But many whites in the post-Civil War South saw change — any change — as unsettling and dangerous, and they wanted no part of it.” “To move in such a direction would be catastrophic as well as tragic,” he wrote. “Retreating to a safer, more secure past was infinitely more attractive and desirable than proceeding into a reckless future that seemed to offer the revulsive prospect of ‘social equality.’” Here’s the scary moment when protesters initially got into the building from the first floor and made their way outside Senate chamber. pic.twitter.com/CfVIBsgywK In 1900, journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells wrote of the mass lynching that took place in New Orleans that July, during which a white mob ran a relentless four-day “campaign of racial terror” against Black residents. The incident, as Wells described it, began with the “inexcusable and unprovoked assault upon two colored men by police officers of New Orleans.” Robert Charles, one of the Black men who was arrested, was attacked by one of the officers; he shot and killed the cop, and evaded arrest. White residents, long fueled by mob mentality as a course of retaliation, were given legal sanction to kill Charles. Reports say at least seven were killed as whites scoured the city preying on Black residents. Wells’ description of the riots in “Mob Rule in New Orleans” is eerily prescient: “During the entire time the mob held the city in its hands … the police and the legally constituted authorities showed plainly where their sympathies were … The ringleaders of the mob were at no time disguised.” James Weldon Johnson, the president of the NAACP, wrote to President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, warning that Black voters planned to vote against candidates supported by the Ku Klux Klan. The NAACP and its leaders were demanding that the Republican Party denounce the racist organization, to no avail. (Trump infamously refused to condemn the KKK on television in 2016.) “That repudiation should be made clear and decisive on the basis of the Klan’s hypocrisy and the violence, disorder and the race and religious hatred known to be an inevitable product of the organization and activity of that body,” Johnson wrote, according to a brief in The New York Times on Sept. 17, 1924. Less than a year later, at the height of the KKK’s popularity, 30,000 members descended upon Washington, and were welcomed by the city. The Washington Post described the scene at the time: “Phantom-like hosts of the Ku Klux Klan spread their white robe over the most historic thoroughfare yesterday in one of the greatest demonstrations this city has ever known.” The more things change the more they stay the same pic.twitter.com/5uR3UlwutA Again, the mob traipsed through the city, unmasked and sure there would be no threats against their livelihood. “The shedding of the masks was a subject of internal debate for the group, a move that some felt would grant their organization added legitimacy and respectability,” the Post reported. In 1939 — on Juneteenth, no less — a mob arrived at 12-year-old Opal Lee’s house . About 500 white residents burned down the family’s house in Fort Worth, Texas. For days, the neighbors had showed up, throwing rocks and terrorizing the Lees, who had just moved into the neighborhood. When Lee’s father got home from work with a gun, an officer said: “If you bust a cap, we’ll let the mob have you.” The whites, once again, had free rein to terrorize. “Of course, my parents stayed as long as they could without getting hurt,” Lee, 93, told HuffPost in June. “And then, they left the house to them, and they burned the place, drug out the furniture, tore the place up.” Civil rights activist Gloria Richardson was one of several people who marched in Cambridge, Maryland, in 1963, fighting for desegregation. She wrote a telegram to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that year amid escalating violence in the small town. There had been gunshots, molotov cocktails and other violence at their demonstrations. “I emphasize that violence has and most likely will occur,” she wrote. “The prevailing climate is such that a state of riot could occur at any second, without warning.” By 1967, riots were sweeping Cambridge, and the rest of nation. Gloria Richardson pushing away a national guardsman’s bayonet during Cambridge riots in the summer of 1963 pic.twitter.com/4IB8TuJsND Perhaps the most stark, and widely known, example of this takes us to Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965. Civil rights activists, including the late John Lewis, set off to peacefully march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to advocate for equal voting rights. Lewis, then 25, was beaten by Alabama state troopers and his skull was fractured. Activist Amelia Boynton Robinson was knocked unconscious. They were tear-gassed. “Some people gave more than a little blood, some gave their very lives. So to each and every one of you, especially you young people … go out there,” Lewis said in March of last year. “Speak up, speak out. Get in the way. Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.” And then there are too many instances to list from the last six years of the Black Lives Matter movement. At protest after protest against police brutality, Black activists were met with state-sanctioned violence at the hands of police. “I guarantee you if that was a Black Lives Matter protest in D.C., there would already be people shackled, arrested or dead,” MSNBC anchor Joy Reid said Wednesday, after Capitol Police mostly stood by and watched the riot unfold. “Shackled, arrested en masse or dead.” There were numerous reports of police violence at peaceful protests last year alone, including in New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas. In Minneapolis, after the killing of George Floyd, officers violated their department’s rules by shooting rubber bullets at protesters who were assembling peacefully, USA Today reported. President-elect Joe Biden addressed the racist double standard on Thursday afternoon. “No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently from the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,” he said. “We all know that’s true, and it is unacceptable.” Maybe accepting that truth is the first step toward dismantling narratives about patriotism, whose dissent is tolerated and the appropriate ways to protest. White terror helped establish this democracy; Black Americans have tirelessly fought for racial equality and freedom since its inception. Any narrative to the contrary is just watering down the truth of our country’s legacy. Erin E. Evans is senior enterprise editor of culture at HuffPost."
12,"Here's What We Learned From The Pandemic, According To 10 Experts",social-justice," Editor, This New World Impact Editor, HuffPost The coronavirus is more than a vector of disease: It is a window onto our greatest failings. The pandemic has exposed a lot of weak points in society, from the lack of health care access and worker protection in the U.S., to the ways cities have been designed for cars instead of pedestrians, to the fragility of food supply chains. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected low-income workers and communities of color, revealing how historical biases have created and reinforced inequalities in society. It has shown that our abuse of the natural world is untenable. The pandemic has been a series of escalating lessons in how not to prepare and how not to respond. We asked 10 experts in health, food, social justice and environment: After all these failures, have we learned anything? Aaron Bernstein, interim director, Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and pediatric hospitalist at Boston Children’s Hospital In the most painful way, pandemics show us what we need to fix in our world. The stress they cause reveals all those parts that most need repair. With COVID, we have seen how festering economic, health and social disparities can blow up in our face. These injustices are the fissures through which pandemics, climate change and other threats to our health course through. At the same time, we can now see that the very actions we need to address the climate crisis, namely lesser reliance on fossil fuels and preventing deforestation, can forestall the next pandemic and promote a healthier, more just and sustainable world. Priya Mulgaonkar, resiliency planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance The pandemic has laid bare the pervasive and violent inequality facing people of color, compounding existing inequities faced by communities burdened with environmental racism, police brutality, and economic inequality. A concerning parallel between COVID-19 and climate change is how unprepared our governments are to respond to disaster, and how those with the most resources are much better able to weather the storm and recover while BIPOC and low-income communities are left defenseless. The failure in our response to the pandemic reflects the gaps in disaster response we have witnessed in moments of climate emergencies like hurricanes, wildfires and heat waves, and foreshadows how we will respond to disaster in the future unless we address systemic inequality. If we have learned anything from 2020, it’s that our response to this crisis must be transformative. The idea of “returning to normal” often emerges in discussions of resilience. But we know a “normal” that is extractive of BIPOC communities and the planet is unacceptable. 2020 has shown that we need to think more holistically about what resilience should look like, and that issues of climate, housing, health, and economic justice are all intertwined. Bill McKibben, author, educator, environmentalist and founder of the nonprofit 350.org The pandemic should remind us that physical reality is real ― I’ve been trying to make this point about carbon for years, that chemistry and physics don’t negotiate. The microbe makes the same point for biology. And as a corollary, fast action in the face of a crisis helps: South Korea had its first case the same day as the U.S. ― and one of those countries then acted swiftly to bend the curve and one didn’t. The same, obviously, goes for global warming. But the biggest point to draw from this past year is that solidarity actually matters. We’ve lived, since President Ronald Reagan, in an era of anti-solidarity: Government is the problem; market forces solve all problems. Reagan’s big laugh line was always, “The nine scariest words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’” After this year, when it’s become clear that the scariest sentences are more like “we’ve run out of ventilators” or “the hillside behind your house is on fire,” those words seem particularly contemptible and archaic. Robert Bullard, distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University and author of several books COVID-19 acted like a “heat-seeking” missile that targeted the most vulnerable in our society resulting in disproportionate infections, hospitalizations and deaths of people of color. The pandemic revealed severe flaws in our political, economic and health system that tolerated elevated risks to front-line essential workers and extremely high financial losses to small businesses owned by people of color. The pandemic widened the racial economic gap between “haves” and “have-nots.” Government pandemic stimulus and relief dollars followed a predictable pattern of “money following money, money following power, and money following whites.” This year, a giant spotlight was shone on the connection between racial redlining practiced a century ago, pollution “hot-spots,” urban heat island disparities and high COVID-19 dangers. As in the case of COVID-19 and climate change, the most vulnerable populations generally suffer the earliest and most damaging setbacks because of where they live, their limited income and economic means, and their lack of access to health care. Government response to climate-induced disasters — hurricanes, floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and related events — inherently benefit whites and more affluent households, and leave behind the most vulnerable. Long before Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, people of color learned the hard way that waiting for the government to respond can be hazardous to their health. Real climate solutions must be built around justice — climate justice, environmental justice, economic justice, health justice and racial justice. Lauren R. Powell, president and CEO of The Equitist, and vice president and head of health care at Time’s Up Foundation This moment is truly unlike any other. It’s made plain the deep social imbalances ― like poverty, racism, sexism, classism to name a few ― that are a new revelation for some, but have been common knowledge for many. As a trained public health professional and former state health official, I can’t help but think about the lessons that I hope health care and public health take and learn from the moment we’re in. Public health and health care systems must embrace and actively work at anti-racism. To not do so is to intentionally feed the pathogen of the diseases and conditions that we’re charged with rooting out. We need more diverse messages and messengers: There are hundreds of exceptionally qualified Black & Brown, Native, LGBTQ+, multilingual, multicultural public health and health care leaders who are better versed at communicating and connecting with the diverse communities they come from. Public health and health care have to elevate diverse leaders to positions of authority and visibility and learn how to speak the language not of science, but of the people ― by connecting with community leaders, faith leaders, and everyday Americans long before the point of an emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic, in all its loss and tragedy, provides us with an opportunity to reimagine and recreate public health and health care systems that not only learn from these vital lessons, but evolve because of them. Ai-jen Poo, co-founder and executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance The pandemic revealed both how insecure so many workers are, and that many of the most insecure, undervalued jobs are essential ― essential to our health, safety and well-being. From the farm worker and grocery worker to the child care and home care worker ― many of our essential workers lacked the wages, paid sick time and family leave, access to health care and family care needed to keep themselves safe as they were keeping us all safe. We must never forget that essential workers are essential all of the time, and that all work in America should offer the basic safety and security that allows for our collective well-being. We can begin with supporting our care workforce ― if we invest in making home care and child care jobs good jobs ― raising wages, offering benefits and real opportunity, we not only improve life for the care workforce, we help enable the rest of America to get back to work, knowing that our loved ones are safe and in good hands. The president-elect has already named this as a priority for economic recovery, as part of his 21st Century Caregiving Plan. Now we must make it a reality. Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage and director of the Food Labor Research Center, University of California Berkeley The pandemic wreaked devastation on the restaurant industry, and in particular on restaurant workers, who were already America’s lowest-wage workers. Prior to the pandemic, tipped restaurant workers received a subminimum wage of as little as $2.13 an hour at the federal level ... with the pandemic, the subminimum wage became a matter of life and death. But this horrific situation has been the impetus for an incredible new unity in the industry for change. During the pandemic, we’ve seen hundreds of independent restaurant owners change their own wage structures to pay a full minimum wage with tips on top. Even the industry’s top trade magazines have had headlines declaring that the industry is rethinking the subminimum wage for tipped workers. Now we just need legislators to follow workers and employers who’ve already come to agree on this issue. Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies, and public health, emerita, New York University, and author of books about food politics The pandemic has taught punishing — and previously largely unrecognized ― lessons about the hazards of food systems designed for profit, not public health. There was the revelation that we have two distinctly separate food supplies, one for retail — supermarkets, groceries, and convenience stores — and the other for institutional food service in restaurants, schools, and the like. When these institutions closed, foods designated for them had no place to go and had to be destroyed. At the same time, the millions of people thrown out of work had no means of buying food. Many lined up for hours outside overstretched private food banks. It became achingly clear how vulnerable millions of Americans are to food insecurity, and how little it takes to put families at risk of hunger. We also quickly saw how severely COVID-19 affected people with conditions related to poor diet: obesity, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, and how important healthful diets are for preventing these problems. Low-wage workers in meat packing plants, grocery stores, and farms were suddenly deemed essential, despite their lack of health care benefits and high risk of contagion. If the pandemic does any good at all, it will be to stimulate public demand for a food system that addresses these problems and puts health and public welfare first. Let’s hope the new administration takes on this challenge and gets busy creating a food system that ends food insecurity, prevents diet-related chronic disease, protects against COVID-19, and while we are at it, produces less waste and environmental damage. Kai Chan, professor at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability at the University of British Columbia The coming year is crucial for biodiversity. In 2019 and early 2020, momentum was really building for recognizing the climate and ecological crises as one interlinked crisis: ecological degradation undermines the climate, and climate change poses a huge threat to ecosystems. The pandemic killed the momentum, understandably. But it’s becoming clear that COVID-19 is not a separate problem, but an interconnected one. The same drivers of the novel coronavirus, and other emerging infectious diseases, are also the drivers of biodiversity loss. These include the wildlife trade that allowed COVID-19 to jump to humans, as well as land-use change and climate change that bring people and wild animals into close contact. Furthermore, the same inequities and broken governance and management systems that propagate the biodiversity and climate crises also made us vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. What’s needed in 2021 is for nations to take aggressive action toward transformative change that addresses the linked needs of people and nature. In September, 64 world leaders signed The Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, committing to reverse biodiversity loss by tackling pollution, putting climate and the environment at the heart of pandemic recovery plans and building sustainable economies. All countries need to take all of the actions within this pledge. The world’s nations must also commit to an aggressive agenda for systemic change when they meet at the United Nation’s biodiversity conference in May. Laurie Santos, professor of psychology at Yale University I think one thing this pandemic has taught us is how much we were taking for granted before. The ability to hang out in my favorite coffee shop, take a vacation, hang out with my friends and family members. I never experienced a sense of awe and joy at doing these activities before COVID, but I hope when I return to them after the pandemic, it will be with a bit more gratitude and a bit more understanding of how cherished these joy-inducing activities really should be. I think all of us will become a bit more appreciative of the little things we didn’t pay attention to before.

13,Pastors: Kelly Loeffler's Smear Of Warnock Is Broad Assault On The Black Church,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A stinging open letter signed by a coalition of African-American pastors in Georgia blasted Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s attacks on rival Rev. Raphael Warnock as a broader assault on the faith traditions of Black congregations. Loeffler has attempted to tarnish the Democratic pastor’s reputation by repeatedly calling him a radical, a socialist and a “radical liberal.” The letter, signed by more than 100 religious leaders, presented Warnock’s support for social justice as an integral element of his faith. When Loeffler attacks that, she attacks Warnock’s religion and the faith of Black congregations who believe in the same religious values, it stated. “We see your attacks against Warnock as a broader attack against the Black Church and faith traditions for which we stand,” the letter charged. The letter demanded that Loeffler stop her “false attacks” on Warnock’s social justice theological and faith traditions, “which visualizes a just and ardent world where love, fairness and equal justice under the law for marginalized people of all races is not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, but also a central message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,” according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The letter also attacked Loeffler’s support of President Donald Trump’s baseless claim of election fraud in Georgia and his attempt to overturn the presidential election results. “What can be more radical, more seditious than supporting 59 attempts to overthrow the will of the people by tossing Black votes?” the letter asked. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, emphasized the link between his social values and his religion in a tweet on Sunday: My faith is the foundation upon which I have built my life. It guides my service to my community and my country. @KLoeffler's attacks on our faith are not just disappointing — they are hurtful to Black churches across Georgia. https://t.co/95KlttxG0s Loeffler hit back at Warnock on Twitter and referred to the religious leaders’ open letter: No one attacked the Black church. We simply exposed your record in your own words. Instead of playing the victim, start answering simple questions about what you’ve said and who you’ve associated yourself with. If you can’t — you shouldn’t be running for U.S. Senate. https://t.co/j06y2mwlCm Earlier this month, Jewish activist organization Bend the Arc retweeted a photo of Loeffler posing with Chester Doles, a former KKK leader who served time in prison for almost beating a Black man to death. Loeffler’s campaign claimed she had no idea who Doles was. But Loeffler has a history of posing with white supremacists and other extremists. Last week, she and Georgia Sen. David Perdue said they adamantly opposed changing the name of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. The name, they said, “honors our nation’s Native American heritage.” Loeffler, who paints herself as a Second Amendment supporter, has also said that Black protesters who legally carried guns during a demonstration were practicing “mob rule.” Pressed on her controversial statements in a debate against Warnock earlier this month, Loeffler insisted: “There is not a racist bone in my body.” She and Purdue face runoff elections on Jan. 5 against their Democratic rivals that will determine which party controls the Senate.

14,"To Reform Police, Biden Has To Look Past Prosecutors To Fill The Federal Bench",social-justice," Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in just over a month, police reform advocates say that he needs to look beyond prosecutors to fill open spots on the federal bench if there’s to be any hope of implementing changes to hold law enforcement officers accountable. Racial and gender diversity was already a critical issue for Biden’s judicial picks, especially following an administration whose choices for federal judges, as well as top federal prosecutors, were overwhelmingly white and male. But reformers say career diversity should also be a factor in Biden’s selections. They’d like to see more nominees with a professional background in areas like public defense and civil rights. Biden, like Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, brings a controversial record on criminal justice to the Oval Office. He may have started out as a public defender, but he is much more closely associated with the 1994 crime bill that helped build a ramp to mass incarceration in America. Harris has more recently labeled herself a “progressive prosecutor,” but her record on criminal justice in California was decidedly mixed and subtly shifted only after the 2014 Ferguson unrest, which laid the groundwork for a more general shift in American views on criminal justice. Judges often come from prosecutorial backgrounds, where they worked closely with police. A new report, from University of Texas law professor Jennifer Laurin and Justice Collaborative Institute research director Kyle Barry, argues that having the bench full of jurists “with narrow professional backgrounds [has] infused the law with a one-sided and often false view of policing, favoring police power over civil liberties.” “How can federal courts make better-informed decisions? Decisions that consider not just the interests of police, but the often brutal reality of the people subject to their control? One (albeit incomplete) solution is both straightforward and popular: Diversify the lived experiences of those sitting on the federal bench, including by appointing more public defenders and civil rights lawyers ― legal professionals who have made a career of challenging rather than defending the police perspective,” the report says. A poll from Data for Progress and the Justice Collaborative Institute found that 58% of voters support “appointing judges who have experience as criminal defense attorneys and civil rights lawyers, not just former prosecutors.” Nearly half of Republicans, 49%, favor the same broader professional diversity. Last month, civil rights and other groups called for Biden’s judicial nominees to include “public interest lawyers, civil rights lawyers, labor lawyers, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and public defenders.” Earlier this month, in Biden’s meeting with civil rights groups, one prominent civil rights leader pushed him to think about “background diversity” that would bring new perspectives to the federal judiciary and reminded the president-elect of his own background in public defense. “Our judiciary has essentially been taken over by former prosecutors,” Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said to reporters after the meeting. “We need balance in the appointments to the bench.” Alec Karakatsanis of Civil Rights Corps, which has filed lawsuits alleging unconstitutional systems of incarceration across the country, told HuffPost that for the last generation, judges have “presided over the largest and most racially disproportionate expansion of human caging in modern world history” and that the lack of racial and background diversity on the bench was a major contributor. “During this time, the U.S. judiciary has been disproportionately white, disproportionately male, and disproportionately wealthy. But it has also been full of prosecutors who, before they became judges, devoted their careers to working with police to build the punishment bureaucracy,” Karakatsanis said. “In every fiber of their being, these former prosecutors have become desensitized to the everyday brutality of putting metal chains on people’s bodies, separating families, and putting human beings in filthy cages,” Karakatsanis said. “Their hard work to put as many people as possible in jail with no evidence that it made anyone safer carried over to their work as judges for years.” Bill Nettles, who served as South Carolina’s U.S. attorney during the Obama administration, had a pretty unusual background for one of the nation’s top federal prosecutors: He was a public defender and criminal defense attorney. Nettles told HuffPost that a law enforcement or prosecution background shouldn’t hinder anyone from becoming a judge, but that a range of voices within the judiciary is important for purposes of judicial legitimacy. A basic premise of jurisprudence within a democracy, he said, is that the decisions of the judiciary only have the authority that the people give them over time. “The voice of the people has come very loud that they want some reform,” Nettles said. “If you have a judiciary that is primarily comprised of people with a prosecution background, then in a time where the community is calling for reform, the decisions will be given more authority by the people if the judiciary has among it people that come from a different point of view,” he said. Biden, as BuzzFeed News reported this week, will face an uphill battle to confirm judicial nominees. Over the past four years, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has focused on filling the bench with Trump’s judicial picks; before that, he regularly impeded President Barack Obama’s nominees. In 2021, Democrats will at best hold an extremely narrow majority in the Senate (depending on the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections next month). At worst for Biden’s picks, McConnell will remain in control. And nominees for legal jobs who have non-prosecutorial backgrounds have previously run into problems in the Senate confirmation process. Look no further than the experience of Debo Adegbile, Obama’s nominee to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, who was attacked over his involvement in a controversial death penalty case while at the Legal Defense Fund. The treatment of Adegbile in the Senate was especially stark: The Black nominee was pilloried for defending a death row inmate, even though the sitting chief justice of the Supreme Court, a Republican nominee, had himself represented a mass murderer. Jamal Brown, a spokesman for the Biden transition, said that the president-elect had “proudly championed the historic confirmations of Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, and reshaped the Senate Judiciary Committee to reflect the diversity and breadth of America. As president, he will nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, and appoint judges who share his commitment to the rule of law, and upholding individual civil rights and civil liberties.” To uphold individual civil rights and liberties, the Justice Collaborative Institute’s report effectively argues, a wider range of professional backgrounds is needed. State-sponsored violence against Black Americans has been the product of a judiciary that has failed to hold police accountable, it says, and that is driven by a “false narrative” of policing that doesn’t value the lives of Black Americans. “The vision of American policing reflected in the Supreme Court’s criminal procedure jurisprudence — a vision of expert crime-fighters under siege and deserving of judicial deference — is neither empirically grounded nor inevitable. It is a construct,” the report states. “And it should come as no surprise that a bench whose professional life has been overwhelmingly dedicated to defending, rather than contesting, the judgments of police would create such a construct. Diversifying the federal bench with lawyers that have insight into the perspectives of those who are the targets of law enforcement action is an important, and politically viable, corrective.” Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Supreme Court Rules Challenge To Trump's Census Plan Is Premature,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has dismissed as premature a challenge to President Donald Trump’s plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the population count used to allot states’ seats in the House of Representatives. But the court’s decision Friday is not a final ruling on the matter and it’s not clear whether Trump will receive final numbers from the Census Bureau before he leaves office next month. The high court said it was too soon to rule on the legality of Trump’s plan because it’s not yet clear how many people he would seek to exclude and whether the division of House seats would be affected. “Consistent with our determination that standing has not been shown and that the case is not ripe, we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time,” the court said in an unsigned opinion. The three liberal justices dissented, saying the effort to exclude people in the country from the population for divvying up House seats is unlawful. “I believe this Court should say so,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. It’s not clear that Friday’s decision will have much practical effect. Documents leaked to the House committee that oversees the Census Bureau suggest the apportionment numbers won’t be ready until after Jan. 20, when Trump leaves office and Joe Biden becomes president. The Census Bureau has acknowledged the discovery of data irregularities in recent weeks that put the Dec. 31 deadline in jeopardy. Dale Ho, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case for the challengers, said the decision was about the timing of the case, not whether the plan complies with federal law. “This ruling does not authorize President Trump’s goal of excluding undocumented immigrants from the census count used to apportion the House of Representatives. The legal mandate is clear — every single person counts in the census, and every single person is represented in Congress. If this policy is ever actually implemented, we’ll be right back in court challenging it,” Ho said. No president has tried to do what Trump outlined in a memo in July — remove millions of noncitizens from the once-a-decade headcount of the U.S. population that determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, as well as the allocation of some federal funding. His administration has defended his authority to exclude at least some people living in the country illegally, including perhaps people who are in immigration detention or those who have been ordered to leave the country. But during arguments last month, acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, would not rule out larger categories of immigrants, including those who have protection from deportation under the DACA program. “We can’t be certain at this point, and we don’t know what the president will decide to do with respect to that,” Wall said. The census case likely is the last of several major cases involving immigrants during Trump’s presidency, which has been notable for its hard line on immigrants. The president has a mixed record at the high court on immigration. The justices upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. by residents of some largely Muslim countries. But the court shot down his attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programs and blocked his bid to add a citizenship question to the census for the first time in 70 years.

0,It’s Harder For Black And Asian People To Trust The COVID Vaccine. Here’s What Needs To Happen.,social-justice," News reporter, HuffPost UK Concerns from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities about the Covid-19 vaccine have not been addressed by the government, campaigners have said, as structural inequalities and historical medical racism has led to “hesitancy” about the jab. The UK on Tuesday became the first country in the world to start administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, in a seismic shift in the battle against the pandemic. But a recent poll by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London found little more than a third of ethnic minority Londoners (39%) said they were likely to take the jab compared with 70% of white people in the capital. That is despite Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities continuing to be disproportionately hospitalised and killed by Covid-19. HuffPost UK has spoken to doctors, academics and members of the public, and discovered the concern stems from racial inequality in the healthcare system and the history of medical experimentation on Black people. Professor Sophie Harman, who specialises in the politics of global health at Queen Mary University of London, said the survey’s findings are “unsurprising”. She said: “Would you trust a government that accepts you’re more likely to die of Covid-19 than your white neighbours and does nothing very much about it? Vaccine hesitancy risks a double tragedy: racial inequality in deaths from Covid-19 and potential racial inequality in vaccine uptake.” Dr Zubaida Haque, a member of the Independent SAGE group of scientists, told HuffPost UK the government had not done enough to make specific efforts to reassure BAME communities about the safety of the vaccine. “There are so many myths surrounding the vaccination that it’s irresponsible of the government not to set up a dedicated website with frequently asked questions,” she said. “You can imagine, ethnic minority communities will be very nervous. They need the government to engage with them, respect their concerns, acknowledge they’re reasonable concerns given that the government hasn’t really done anything to address their vulnerabilities.” “Racism has plagued the healthcare service as well as the history of medical experimentation on Black individuals. Concerns from Black communities regarding the Covid-19 vaccine are not invalid” Campaigners argue many in BAME communities are “nervous” because of a litany of questionable historical and modern day medical treatments, and repeated examples of healthcare benefiting white people disproportionately – with non-white people generally experiencing poorer health outcomes throughout their lives. In April, two French doctors came under fire for racism after a TV debate in which one suggested trials in Africa to see if a tuberculosis vaccine would prove effective against coronavirus. The comments received an angry response on social media, including from former footballer Didier Drogba who cautioned Europeans not to “take African people as human guinea pigs”. Between 1845 and 1849, Dr James Marion Sims – widely regarded as the “father of modern gynaecology” – tortured enslaved Black woman while perfecting his medical surgeries on their bodies with consent or an anaesthetic. He also invented the modern speculum, Sims’s position for vaginal exams, which he first used on slaves and has gone on to be used widely within healthcare. As such, Sims is viewed favourably by many historians and has several worldwide monuments, despite his brutality. During the Tuskegee Study in 1932, Black American men died of syphilis over 40 years in disproportionate numbers due to poor care during a series of unethical medical trials. More recently, south Asian women have been known to complain about having their pain dismissed by doctors who claim they are suffering from the so-called “Mrs Bibi syndrome”, also known as “Begum syndrome”, HuffPost UK has reported. Black women are five times more likely to die in childbirth than white women, a disparity the NHS acknowledges and regrets but does not have a target to end. In a collaboration with Black Ballad this summer, Black women revealed the shocking racism they faced in the UK’s healthcare system during pregnancy and childbirth – including instances where doctors didn’t believe their pain. What’s more, Black people are severely underrepresented in the UK’s database of Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial volunteers. Responding to BAME communities not being included on the vaccine priority list, Jacqui Burnett – a Black woman – said: “Blacks are fed up of being the ones vaccines are tried out on first historically. Our cup is full and running over.” Someone else echoed this, saying: “I don’t want to be their experiment.” A Black woman, Vanessa, said: “Give the politicians and top health advisers it first. Wait a year then come back and talk to me.” Another person of colour expressed fear that they would be used as “lab rats for a vaccine that hasn’t been proven 100% safe now and in the future”. In fact, there are no safety concerns about the vaccine. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries. Like some other foods and vaccines, people with a history of severe allergic reactions have been advised not to receive it, but that does not mean it is unsafe for anyone else. Rather than the result of shortcuts or the loosening of safety standards, the speed with which Covid vaccines have been developed is due to the phenomenal money and effort thrown at the problem – the UK government alone has spent £6bn in total to develop and procure them. We put five popular vaccine myths to an independent scientist – here’s how she responded to each of them. A Public Health England review published this summer found people from ethnic minorities were more likely to contract and die from Covid-19 and ministers promised to take steps to reduce disparities in these risk and outcomes. This pledge has not been not honoured. Haque said: “Why have a review which showed that people from BAME backgrounds and those living in more deprived areas are more likely to be hospitalised and die from Covid-19 if you’re not going to address that risk?” Anti-vaxxers have been responsible for peddling wild conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines, including false claims that the jab will modify people’s DNA and result in patients being implanted with a microchip that will be used to control the population. But campaigners have stressed the importance of not confusing vaccine hesitancy for anti-vaccination. Haque explained: “There is a difference between the anti-vaxxers and the vaccine hesitant group. It would be a big disservice to BAME communities to suggest that they are the anti-vaxxers because they tend to be irrational, have very different reasons for not taking vaccines and a lot of it isn’t necessarily based on the science so to speak. “Vaccine hesitancy isn’t necessarily irrational. It can be very reasonable doubt, anxiety, nervousness about the vaccine. What we really need is for the government to engage with that.” As recently as Wednesday during a conference on ethnic minority health inequality, equalities minister Kemi Badenoch – a Black woman – dismissed the role of structural racism in medical outcomes for BAME communities. Pointing to Badenoch’s responsibility in addressing ethnic disproportionality in transmission of the virus, Haque said: “That signals the government’s approach to how seriously they take the virus risk among ethnic minority communities. This isn’t an equalities issue – it’s a public health issue. “Unless over 60% of the population takes the vaccine we will not get population immunity which means we won’t be coming out of this pandemic. At the moment there’s quite a high rate of vaccine hesitancy.” Luton-based GP Dr Simisola Alabi described the concerns that some Black people have shared with her about the vaccine. It boils down to one fundamental question: is it safe? The jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that sometimes take a decade – although scientists have been able to assure the public no corners have been cut. “The vaccine is relatively safe but the truth is a lot of the work that is supposed to have been done in developing the vaccine could not be done because of time constraints – such a how it interacts with other medicines, its effects on reproduction,” Alabi told HuffPost UK. The vaccine was not tested on pregnant women, which is why the NHS says they should wait until after giving birth to take it. “Black communities are ignored generally, in every scenario, so it’s an uphill task when you’re trying to get good health outcomes as a patient. I take exception to the fact that we haven’t been prioritised on the vaccination list – at least give us a chance to say no.” Alabi – clinical director at the multi-practice Titan Primary Care Network – said many Black people she knows have access to disinformation videos about the vaccine that consist of “utter rubbish” but are being shared widely across WhatsApp. She said: “Given the lack of trust in the government, there is a responsibility on Black people to utilise sound resources available and educate themselves about what is and isn’t safe.” Minority ethnic healthcare professionals are playing a key role in sharing reliable information about the vaccine on social media. Just last week on Clubhouse, a new invite-only voice-based app, UK Black doctors took it upon themselves to address concerns and misinformation about the vaccine. The Ubele Initiative, a Black-led social enterprise, has been independently collating information regarding people’s vaccination concerns which it intends to share with the Greater London Authority. Melanin Medics is a UK charity that promotes diversity in medicine. Its founder and chief exec Olamide Dada told HuffPost UK: “Given the events of this year, which have revealed the extent to which racism has plagued the healthcare service, as well as the history of medical experimentation on Black individuals, concerns from Black communities regarding the Covid-19 vaccine are not invalid. “These events have contributed to a great degree of distrust within Black communities, questioning whether the vaccine really is in their best interest. We know that Black people are more at risk of Covid-19 and in light of this, both trust and transparency are needed to ensure that at-risk groups are well protected. “Whilst years of distrust cannot be rebuilt in a single moment, it is imperative that these concerns are well-addressed in a timely manner in the best interest of Black communities. This is a pivotal step in addressing racial inequality that has manifested itself within the healthcare system.” Nadhim Zahawi, minister responsible for Covid vaccine deployment, told HuffPost UK: “Vaccines save lives and are the most effective public health intervention since clean water. “All vaccines go through a robust clinical trial process and are only rolled out to patients once they have met the strict safety, effectiveness and quality standards of the UK’s medicines regulator, the MHRA. “The NHS will provide advice and information at every possible opportunity, including working closely with BAME communities, to support those receiving a vaccine and to anyone who has questions about the vaccination process.” HuffPost UK has approached the Equalities Office and Downing Street for comment.

2,Arizona Man Sentenced To Prison For Role In Neo-Nazi Plot Targeting Journalists,social-justice," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost An Arizona man has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for plotting with a neo-Nazi group to threaten and intimidate journalists and advocates working to expose anti-Semitism, federal prosecutors said. Johnny Roman Garza, 21, was sentenced Wednesday by a Seattle judge after pleading guilty in September to conspiring with other members of the terroristic hate group Atomwaffen Division to carry out threats in Washington, Arizona and Florida. Garza was one of four people arrested by the FBI in February and indicted by federal prosecutors. “While this defendant did not hatch this disturbing plot, he enthusiastically embraced it, researching addresses for journalists and those who oppose hate in our communities,” said U.S. Attorney Brian Moran. In his plea agreement, Garza admitted to helping identify various journalists for targeting and admitted to having left a threatening poster outside the home of an editor of a Jewish magazine. “Your actions have consequences. Our patience has its limits. ... You have been visited by your local Nazis,” read the poster, which listed some of the victim’s personal information and depicted a figure holding a Molotov cocktail in front of a burning home. Garza said he had intended to leave a similar poster outside a Phoenix apartment where a member of the Arizona Association of Black Journalists lived but said he was not able to find a suitable place for it during his visit. Garza, who had faced up to five years in prison, expressed remorse for his actions in court. Garza said he joined the hate group during “a time of darkness and isolation,” which made it easier for “rebellious and resentful” influences to take over, prosecutors said. “Very unfortunately, I fell in with the worst crowd you can probably fall in with, a very self-destructive crowd at the least,” he told U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, according to The Associated Press. Coughenour said he felt Garza was truly remorseful and that he took into consideration Garza’s youth and “turbulent childhood” ahead of sentencing, as well as Garza’s efforts after his arrest to educate himself about the minority groups he targeted. Prison time was necessary, the judge said, “given the severity of this conduct and the horrible impact it had on people that are important in our society.” The judge further took a moment to admonish top U.S. officials who refer to journalists as “enemies of the people,” saying it makes people, particularly vulnerable youth, think that such conduct is appropriate. Coughenour did not refer to President Donald Trump by name, the AP reported. Garza’s defense attorney, Seth M. Apfel, also called his client’s remorse genuine and said Garza has taken classes to learn about Black and Jewish culture and wants to help prevent other people from getting pulled into hate groups. “Certainly, in my view, his transformation was very sincere,” Apfel told The New York Times. “And I’m saying that not only as a lawyer but also as a Jewish man who’s married to a Black woman.” The remaining three defendants have yet to be sentenced. Those are Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington; Kaleb Cole, 24, of Montgomery, Texas; and Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 21, of Spring Hill, Florida. Parker-Dipeppe pleaded guilty to a federal conspiracy charge in September and is scheduled to be sentenced in February. Cole and Shea, who are described by prosecutors as the leaders of the conspiracy, are scheduled for trial in March. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
3,We’re Thinking About Unemployment All Wrong. Biden’s Team Could Change That.,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The unemployment rate is not as good as it seems. On Friday, the Labor Department announced the overall jobless rate ticked down slightly to 6.7% in November. That’s much improved from the early days of the pandemic in April, when the overall rate was 14.7%. But that number hides a crisis. The Black unemployment rate remains stubbornly high: At 10.3%, it is similar to what the overall jobless rate was at the height of the Great Recession. The unemployment rate for Black men is 11.2%. In other words, Black unemployment is at a level that economists and policymakers have historically considered catastrophic for white workers. And that is not unusual. Since the government began tracking Black unemployment in 1972, the rate has steadily remained about double the overall number. Black workers are typically the first fired and last hired in any crisis, including in the pandemic. After COVID-19 initially threw millions out of work, white workers were hired back at about twice the rate of Black workers. Typically, policymakers haven’t paid all that much attention to the Black unemployment rate. If the jobless numbers are low overall, then most economists and lawmakers think the economy is doing pretty well. That could change in President-elect Joe Biden’s administration. This summer, one of Biden’s top economic advisers, Jared Bernstein, co-authored a paper that points to a fresh way of looking at this information. This past week, Biden announced his economic team, and Bernstein joined a diverse group of economists ― including Heather Boushey, the former head of the economic think tank Equitable Growth. She has long focused on policies like child care and paid leave. Cecilia Rouse, dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and Biden’s pick to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, has long done research focused on inequalities in education and race. And his pick for treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, got her start as a labor economist considering how to make jobs better for everyone. They are all known for careers in studying and advocating for a more inclusive economy. This paper points to just one of the ideas this team has for getting there. Instead of calibrating economic policy to the overall unemployment rate, Bernstein and co-author Janelle Jones suggest looking at the Black unemployment rate instead. The wonky term they use is “disaggregating” the data. “It’s a straightforward proposal that would have serious implications for Black workers but also the economy in general,” said Jones, who is managing director at the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive group focused on economic policy. Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration, was a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities when they put out their research. The point of their work was to figure out how to avoid one of the key mistakes of the last financial downturn, Jones said. In the years after the 2008 financial crisis, political leaders declared the economy recovered when Black workers were still in crisis. “We’d see the reports about the longest economic recovery in the history of the country. That was false,” she said. For the Black community during that period there was a massive loss of wealth ― through the housing bust ― and there was still high unemployment, even at a time when on average the economy looked improved. The point is to look at the economy from the vantage point of those who are typically far behind, Jones said. Historically, Black unemployment rates have been high; but you could also drill into the numbers for Hispanic people or, say, Indigenous groups. “We’re saying we still need to do more as long as this group needs it,” she said. Jones and Bernstein wanted to avoid a rerun of the last recession during the COVID-19 economic crisis. “How do we make sure we haven’t declared success while Black workers are still suffering?” said Jones. Disaggregating the unemployment rate would be key to doing it differently this time. And, unlike some other moves the administration could make in the fight against inequality (think erasing student debt), it wouldn’t be a difficult policy to put in place, Jones said. (The Washington Post wrote about the idea back in June.) First of all, we already have the data. The Labor Department breaks out these numbers every month. The pitch would be to have the Federal Reserve, the folks responsible for keeping the economy in check, to keep the Black unemployment rate in mind when making policy decisions. Right now, the Fed has a dual mandate of keeping unemployment relatively low while also making sure inflation (the price of stuff) doesn’t get too high. Typically, the central bank will start raising interest rates to “cool” a hot economy when the country gets close to something called full employment. For Black workers, this hasn’t been great. Because what looks like “full employment” overall is still not great for Black workers. In 2015, for example, the Fed started raising rates again even though the Black unemployment rate was still in double digits. Practically speaking, it’s a policy that has left millions of Black workers and other disadvantaged groups out of any kind of economic recovery. It seems counterintuitive, but focusing on the Black jobless rate would make economic policy more inclusive, said Gbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress. “When we target the most marginalized, that brings everybody in,” he said. One thing that’s important to understand, Ajilore said, is that the U.S. has always had a race-conscious way of looking at unemployment. The focus just happened to be on the white unemployment rate. But that’s left a broad swath of people out. “We’ve always had race-conscious policies, but we’ve targeted the wrong race,” Ajilore said. Monetary policy would be one piece of it, but not all of it. Focusing on the groups hit hardest by the economy would also help reorient Congress toward more fiscal stimulus. In the Great Recession, Congress started cutting back as soon as the overall rate started falling. So far, it looks like that’s what’s happening now. Testifying before Congress this week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin — though conceding the U.S. needs more relief money now — also painted the economic picture as fairly rosy, describing the unemployment rate as bouncing back from its depths in the spring. The prevailing wisdom that unemployment has been getting better, even as millions of people are out of work, has played a role in Congress’ failure to pass further stimulus. The aid from the CARES Act, the multitrillion-dollar package passed in March to deal with the pandemic, is mostly gone. But all the problems that legislation addressed are still with us: Evictions are expected to pick up, hunger is at historic highs, states and local governments are facing massive budget shortfalls. Yet, as the year closes out, it’s still not clear if Congress can pass anything more to help. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,"Inside Classrooms, The Differences Between Haves And Have-Nots Have Already Grown",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost As soon as schools reopened in September, it was apparent that the gaps in her son’s classroom between the haves and the have-nots had grown, says parent Amina Scott. Scott suspects that some kids had access to enrichment programs and hands-on help during the many months that schools and summer camps were shut down, and some, like her third-grade son, had not. Scott’s son, Yasin, attends a public school in the affluent suburb of Newton, just outside Boston. He is bused from their home in the Roxbury neighborhood to the suburbs through a voluntary desegregation program called METCO. Yasin has always been at grade level or even ahead of his classmates, especially excelling in reading, says Scott. But this year, while attending in-person classes two times a week on a hybrid schedule, the dynamic shifted. After months away from school, some of his classmates seemed to have mysteriously advanced, easily reciting concepts he says they were never taught. In the early weeks of class, Yasin came home upset, questioning where his classmates could have learned such material. He used to indulge his mom’s questions about what he was learning and how his day was, but he soon stopped wanting to talk about school, telling Scott that he had finished his homework even when he had skipped questions. “He feels behind and it’s affecting his confidence. I could tell he was avoiding talking about it,” said Scott, a 29-year-old single mother who works full time at a nonprofit in addition to holding down two consulting gigs. “To me it’s scary, it worries me but also I feel sad. I don’t know what to do about it.” Scott believes other kids in her son’s class spent the spring and summer getting extra tutoring and virtual enrichment, overseen by their parents. Education researchers have been studying how much learning loss is taking place as a result of school shutdowns and remote school. The latest numbers from NWEA, an education research group, says that the average student in third through eighth grade has lost 5 to 10 percentile points in math, but remained on track for reading. Overall, these numbers proved better than earlier, more dire projections, but questions still remain about how vulnerable student groups specifically are faring. Fewer of the students in groups more likely to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 participated in the research, and early indicators suggest that Black and Hispanic students in upper elementary grades may have experienced small declines in reading scores not shared by other groups. Researchers cautioned that it’s too early to draw firm conclusions. Scott, as a middle-class mother in a sea of richer families, says she has already seen disparities widen in her son’s classroom. Scott, like many parents, has struggled since March to balance her career with supervising her son’s schooling. On days of remote learning, she sits next to him, making sure he doesn’t turn off his mic or camera, in between returning emails and calling into meetings. She doesn’t have time to check over his work like she normally would. She’s staying afloat, but just barely. “My head is going to explode soon,” she said. She wonders if other families in her son’s class have faced the same struggles, speculating that in two-parent households, one might have the luxury of helping their child with homework or providing extra tutoring. During a normal summer, Scott would send Yasin to camps focusing on academic enrichment, but those were closed this summer. In lieu of camp, he was supervised by a 15-year-old cousin. Instead of learning new science concepts, he came home with new knowledge of TikTok dances. “It was like a kid babysitting a kid,” Scott said. She recalled running into a parent of Yasin’s classmates one day while running errands. The parent said she had enrolled her child in enrichment activities conducted via Zoom, and spent all day going over material with him. Scott suspects there were more children with such opportunities and that other parents had more time to help supervise or tutor. By the time school started, it felt like Yasin was trying to catch up to a moving train. Some of the ways in which groups of affluent parents have been using their wealth for educational advantage during the pandemic have been well-documented. Many private schools, in some areas more likely to open in-person education, have seen increased enrollment numbers. Other families have turned to “pandemic pods,” which bring teachers into students’ homes to work with small groups of pupils of varying sizes and at varying costs. But there’s little research on how often families are taking advantage of increased tutoring or other supplemental services, says Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a research analysis organization. Anecdotally, she has heard of tutoring companies with growing enrollment numbers. “It’s the way things have always worked. Advantaged families find a way, so this should not be news to us,” Lake said. “But the stakes are so much higher now for kids who don’t have access to those resources. It’s not just about supplemental enrichment, it’s about core learning, that’s what’s really worrisome.” These disparities might be especially stark in a program like METCO, which buses a small number of Boston’s students of color to attend school in the rich suburbs. By enrolling in the program, parents like Scott hope that high-quality instruction and ample classroom resources can help to even the playing field for their kids. But the pandemic has only further exposed the artifice that school alone has the ability to close achievement gaps. Resources and money will always play a role. Newton Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment. But the district’s back-to-school plan, posted online, emphasizes the need for equity, especially for children in the METCO program, noting that students of color are more likely to have had someone close to them who suffered severely or even died from COVID-19. These students are also more likely to have been affected by high-profile instances of racism this past summer, which set off months of protests around the country. Teachers have been participating in professional development around these issues, anti-racist practices and culturally responsive teaching, the district says. Some of the disparities between METCO and non-METCO children have also made life more difficult for single mother Trenyca Schneider. Three of Schneider’s four children attend school in the Boston suburb of Brookline through METCO. Her kids are now back in school on a hybrid schedule, but at first she struggled to get her children the school supplies they needed for remote learning at home ― much of which had previously been provided for them at school. The new supplies, like headphones, strained Schneider’s budget. It didn’t seem to occur to district leaders, Schneider speculates, that not every family had money to spare. “I think the district was insensitive about supplies because it’s used to catering to high-income families,” she said, while noting that overall, she has found teachers, district leaders and METCO coordinators incredibly supportive during a challenging time. “METCO has done a wondrous job making sure we had computers,” she said. Brookline’s school district did not respond to a request for comment. “You have teachers saying, ‘Ask your parent for help if you don’t understand the work,’ but what if the parent is not available?” said Schneider, who works two jobs, as a human resources generalist Monday through Friday and as a patient ethics coordinator at a hospital on the weekend. “It’s too much for me, and I feel like I’m losing it as I go day by day.” Colin Stokes, director of communications, outreach and engagement for METCO, said that the program’s central office has been working to fill some of these gaps “through grants, partnerships, and volunteers; for things like tutoring, enrichment, technology, and food distribution.” In the Newton district, where Scott’s son attends school, elementary-age students have been attending class in person two days a week for half-days. While most children return home and finish the day online, because of their increased commute time, METCO students remain in the school building to finish classes, with volunteer teachers supervising. At first, Scott said it seemed like “a big recess session,” but after she and other parents complained, it improved. But the longer the pandemic continues, the more Scott worries about the long-term impact of the past few months, and the more she has raced to try and make up for lost time for her son. In October, she reached out to her son’s teacher to explain that she felt like every other student was further ahead on their multiplication tables. The teacher told her about extra tutoring being offered in the district. This tutoring, in the past offered in person after school, had bumped up against the METCO bus schedule, says Scott, ultimately precluding her son from participating. This year, the sessions are virtual. Scott immediately signed up her son, and she says it’s been helping. She also attempted to enroll her son in extra tutoring at Kumon and Sylvan Learning, but neither option worked out. She felt like Sylvan was dragging out the virtual sessions for money, and when she brought her son to a Kumon center for an in-person assessment, they seemed uninterested in serving a child who was already behind. She cried in the car on the way home. At home, Scott has been having Yasin complete as many multiplication problems as he can in a minute before he’s allowed to watch television or get other screen time. The amount of screen time he gets is dependent on how many problems he gets right. Little by little he’s improving. “If I’m not on top of it, if I don’t get the tutoring or the extra help, if I can’t stay on top of where he’s struggling, I think it’s going to be really detrimental,” Scott said. “These are the basic foundational years of his life. The stuff you learn in this part of elementary school is going to project how you perform in middle school, in high school, and higher education as well. It’s a little scary. There aren’t that many resources for us.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Immigrants At New Jersey ICE Facility On Hunger Strike To Protest Unsafe Conditions,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost HACKENSACK, N.J. — At least eight immigrants being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at Bergen County Jail in New Jersey are participating in a hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility and demand to be released. Local activists say the hunger strike is in its 18th day. ICE would not comment on how long the immigrants have stopped eating. Family members and activists who have spoken to detainees say conditions inside the facility are “dire.” Gabriela Pucha, a 24-year-old New Jersey resident who was among more than a dozen protesters gathered outside the jail on a cold and cloudy Tuesday, said she has been in touch with two current detainees who described having the heat turned off, unsanitary conditions and being denied medical attention. “We’re here in support of the hunger strikers,” said Pucha, who wore a gray raincoat and held a sign that read “detention is torture.” An ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations spokesperson from the Newark field office told HuffPost that “accusations of unsanitary conditions are false,” but offered no additional details. Cars that drove by honked their horns in support of the protesters and detainees. One police officer watched the protesters from his vehicle and rarely engaged with them. The wind blew harder on this wintry December day as the temperature dropped to the low 40s, but the protesters remained undeterred. This is the second hunger strike at Bergen County Jail since the beginning of November, when detainee Marcial Morales Garcia began refusing meals after he was initially denied release despite serious medical conditions that put him at high risk for COVID-19. He was later released. Several detainees currently being held at the facility have preexisting conditions and also fear a coronavirus outbreak. Garcia, who spoke a protest on Friday, told demonstrators he lacked drinkable water and had to drink toilet water instead, according to a press release from the Abolish ICE NY-NJ coalition. He also described a rat infestation and mold on the walls. More than 5,000 detainees have contracted the coronavirus while being held in immigration detention centers around the country, according to immigration officials. Although ICE officials said the agency has taken precautions to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, activists say it’s not enough and that tight spaces such as detention centers and jails like the one in Bergen County are particularly vulnerable and can face a deadly outbreak at any moment. Although Bergen County Jail hasn’t had any outbreaks, Andrea, a 33-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, worries for her brother who has been held there since November 2019. Andrea, whom HuffPost has given an alias because she fears retaliation by immigration officials, calls her brother three times a day. She is worried about him contracting the virus and says he’s vulnerable because he has asthma and a previous head injury. She told HuffPost through a translator on the phone that her brother has been denied drinking water and resorts to drinking out of the toilet. He also told her that the heat has been shut off and the conditions have been extremely cold lately. She also said the officials took away the detainees’ commissary. An ICE-ERO spokesperson called those allegations false. Andrea said her brother decided to participate in the hunger strike because he saw no changes to his case and the conditions of the facility. He hasn’t eaten for 18 days. She is currently caring for her brother’s 7-year-old son. She said she and her family came to the U.S. for a better life and to be with her brother. If he is deported, they would be separated again and his son would be without a father. “He wants to be free, even with an ankle shackle. He wants to be with his son. He wants to work. He isn’t a thief. He doesn’t have any charges. I don’t know why immigration won’t free him,” she added. More than 200 immigrants, mainly from Mexico and Central America, are being held at the Bergen County Correctional Facility, where most of the residents are waiting for deportation hearings. Bergen County is one of several New Jersey counties that have multimillion-dollar contracts with ICE to house thousands of immigrants. From January 2015 to March 2018, ICE sent more than $150 million to Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties in the northern part of the state. Those three counties are all controlled by Democrats, leaving some activists pessimistic that a Biden presidency will result in significant immigration reforms. “We want nothing less than a full abolition of ICE and all oppressive systems,” 19-year-old Buzz Issac told HuffPost. “We recognize that this protest is not going to do that on its own. No single action is going to do that, so we are trying to embrace a diversity of tactics, and we’re using this as just mainly a way to show that we’re here.” The protests, which began the day after Thanksgiving, are planned to continue until this Friday. Protesters on Tuesday were heard chanting “Abolish ICE,” and carried signs that read “free them all.” At one point, the protesters moved to stand in front of the building that housed the detainees. Facing the windows, they chanted, “We are here for you.” One police officer told the protesters that they were not allowed to talk directly to the detainees ― as indicated on a sign hung on the metal fence separating the facility and the protesters. The protesters carried on anyway. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Supreme Court Seems Skeptical Of Trump's Census Plan,social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sounded skeptical Monday that President Donald Trump could categorically exclude people living in the country illegally from the population count used to allot seats among the states in the House of Representatives. But it also appeared possible that the justices could avoid a final ruling on the issue until they know how broadly the Trump administration acts in its final days in office and whether the division of House seats is affected. No president has tried to do what Trump outlined in a memo in July — remove millions of non-citizens from the once-a-decade head count of the U.S. population that determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, as well as the allocation of some federal funding. The court, meeting by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic, heard arguments in its second case in two years related to the 2020 census and immigrants. The census already is facing novel questions over deadlines, data quality and politics, including whether the incoming Biden administration would do anything to try to reverse decisions made under Trump. One possibility outlined by acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, is that Trump might try to leave out of the count people who are in immigration detention or those who have been ordered to leave the country. But under questioning from Justice Elena Kagan, Wall would not rule out larger categories of immigrants, including those who have protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programs. “We can’t be certain at this point, and we don’t know what the president will decide to do with respect to that,” Wall said. Justice Amy Coney Barrett was among several members of the court who said the administration’s argument for broad discretion in deciding whom to exclude is troublesome because “a lot of the historical evidence and long-standing practice really cuts against your position.” The court decided to hear the case on a fast track, based on the administration’s plea for a decision by early January, when Trump is required by law to transmit census numbers to Congress. The Census Bureau is supposed to send the data to Trump by Dec. 31. But Wall told the court Monday, “We are not currently on pace to send the report to the president by the year-end statutory deadline.” He said census officials told him they hope some data is available in January. A delay of even three weeks would mean the Census Bureau would be turning in the numbers to a new president. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Several conservative justices suggested that the better course for the court would be to avoid ruling immediately on lawsuits filed by New York and other Democratic-led states as well as immigration advocates because Trump’s intentions are speculative at this point. “Mr. Ho, if the additional information would be beneficial in a few weeks, wouldn’t it be beneficial to actually resolving this case? As the questioning seems to suggest, there’s some difficulty in assessing exactly what information will be available and what that information will be,” Justice Clarence Thomas said to Dale Ho, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing immigration groups. The court could simply sit on the case in front of it to see what happens, or dismiss it as premature. The second option would allow Trump to move forward with his plan and lead inevitably to a new lawsuit. Trump has a mixed record at the high court on immigration. The justices upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. by residents of some largely Muslim countries. But the court shot down his attempt to end the DACA program and blocked his bid to add a citizenship question to the census for the first time in 70 years.

13,Supreme Court Weighs Trump Bid To Bar Illegal Immigrants From Census Count,social-justice," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday is set to take up President Donald Trump’s unprecedented and contentious effort to exclude illegal immigrants from the population totals used to allocate U.S. House of Representatives districts to states. The challengers to Trump’s July directive include various states led by New York, cities, counties and immigrant rights groups. They have argued that the Republican president’s move could leave several million people uncounted and cause California, Texas and New Jersey to lose House seats, which are based on a state’s population count in the decennial census. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices appointed by Trump, is scheduled to hear an 80-minute oral argument by teleconference. Trump lost his bid for re-election on Nov. 3. This case focuses on one of several policy moves his administration is rushing to complete before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. The census in mandated by the U.S. Constitution. The challengers argued that Trump is prohibited by the Constitution’s text from excluding illegal immigrants from the population count. The Constitution requires that the apportionment of House seats be based upon the “whole number of persons in each state.” The challengers said Trump’s plan, undertaken as part of the government’s responsibility to administer the 2020 census, also violates a federal law called the Census Act that outlines how a census must be conducted. They said Trump’s plan would weaken the political power of states with larger numbers of illegal immigrants, including heavily Democratic California, by undercounting their true populations and depriving them of House seats. If California loses House districts, that likely would mean Democrats lose House seats, benefiting Trump’s fellow Republicans. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. Until now, the government’s practice was to count all people regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. “That’s what everyone has always thought,” said Dale Ho, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents immigrant groups in the case. Ho said he is optimistic the court’s conservatives, who often tout the importance of interpreting laws as written, would view this one as a “rather easy case.” Trump’s lawyers argued in court papers that the president acted within his authority and that the challengers lacked the necessary legal standing to bring the case. Trump’s administration “has virtually unfettered discretion as to what data will be used in enumerating individual persons in each state for purposes of the decennial census and apportionment,” Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall wrote. The court is deciding the case on a expedited schedule, with a ruling due before the end of the year. That would make it difficult for the incoming Biden administration to revisit Trump’s plan if it is upheld. Trump’s hardline stance toward immigration has been a hallmark of his presidency. The Supreme Court last year ruled 5-4 against Trump’s effort to add a citizenship question to the census. Critics said the question was intended to frighten immigrants from taking part in the population count and artificially reduce population numbers in heavily Democratic areas, also to benefit Republicans. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices in that ruling. But the addition of Trump’s third appointee Amy Coney Barrett to the court changes its dynamics, as seen in action by the justices on Wednesday in a case in which they backed Christian and Jewish houses of worship that challenged New York state’s latest restrictions in novel coronavirus hot spots. Roberts dissented along with the court’s three liberals but Barrett’s vote in favor of the religious groups proved decisive. A three-judge panel in New York ruled against the administration in September in the current case and the justices agreed to take up the appeal on Oct. 16. Federal courts in California and Maryland have reached the same conclusion in other cases though one court in Washington ruled for Trump. By statute, the president is due to send Congress a report in early January with the population of each of the states and their entitled number of House districts. Once states are allocated their districts, they themselves draw the boundaries for the districts, which will be used first in the 2022 congressional elections. The number of House seats for each state also determines how many votes that state gets in the Electoral College, the system used to determine the winner of presidential elections. In a close election, one or two electoral votes could swing the outcome. The census itself does not gather data on a person’s citizenship or immigration status. Trump’s administration would base its numbers on data gathered elsewhere. The U.S. Census Bureau, a spokesman said, “will make public the methods used to provide state-level counts once we have them finalized.” Thomas Wolf, a lawyer at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it is not yet clear if the administration will even be able to come up with usable numbers. “This is not the way a transparent constitutional democracy is supposed to be run,” Wolf added. Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School in Virginia who filed a brief opposing Trump, said although the challengers have a strong case, one wrinkle could be that some conservative justices embrace a broad view of presidential powers. “We can’t be too definitive about what the justices will do with it,” Somin said.

14,Pope Francis Shows Support For George Floyd Protests In New Book,social-justice," ROME (AP) — Pope Francis is supporting demands for racial justice in the wake of the U.S. police killing of George Floyd and is blasting COVID-19 skeptics and the media that spread their conspiracies in a new book penned during the Vatican’s coronavirus lockdown. In “Let Us Dream,” Francis also criticizes populist politicians who whip up rallies in ways reminiscent of the 1930s, and the hypocrisy of “rigid” conservative Catholics who support them. But he also criticizes the forceful downing of historic statues during protests for racial equality this year as a misguided attempt to “purify the past.” The 150-page book, due out Dec. 1, was ghost-written by Francis’ English-language biographer, Austen Ivereigh, and at times the prose and emphasis seems almost more Ivereigh’s than Francis.’ At its core, “Let Us Dream” aims to outline Francis’ vision of a more economically and environmentally just post-coronavirus world where the poor, the elderly and weak aren’t left on the margins and the wealthy aren’t consumed only with profits. But it also offers new personal insights into the 83-year-old Argentine pope and his sense of humor. At one point, Francis reveals that after he offered in 2012 to retire as archbishop of Buenos Aires when he turned 75, he planned to finally finish the thesis he never completed on the 20th-century German intellectual, Romano Guardini. “But in March 2013, I was transferred to another diocese,” he deadpans. Francis was elected pope, and bishop of Rome, on March 13, 2013. The publisher said the book was the first written by a pope during a major world crisis and Ivereigh said it was done as a response to the coronavirus and the lockdown. For Francis, the pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to imagine and plan for a more socially just world. At times, it seems he is directing that message squarely at the United States, as Donald Trump’s administration winds down four years of “America first” policies that excluded migrants from Muslim countries and diminished U.S. reliance on multilateral diplomacy. Without identifying the U.S. or Trump by name, Francis singles out Christian-majority countries where nationalist-populist leaders seek to defend Christianity from perceived enemies. “Today, listening to some of the populist leaders we now have, I am reminded of the 1930s, when some democracies collapsed into dictatorships seemingly overnight,” Francis wrote. “We see it happening again now in rallies where populist leaders excite and harangue crowds, channeling their resentments and hatreds against imagined enemies to distract from the real problems.” People fall prey to such rhetoric out of fear, not true religious conviction, he wrote. Francis addressed the killing of Floyd, a Black man whose death at the knee of a policeman set off protests this year across the United States. He also reflected on the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church and other #MeToo abuses of power that he said are rooted in a sense of entitlement, domination and arrogance over others. Referring to Floyd by name, Francis said: “Abuse is a gross violation of human dignity that we cannot allow and which we must continue to struggle against.” But he warned that protests can be manipulated and decried the attempt to erase history by downing statues of U.S. Confederate leaders. A better way, he said, is to debate the past through dialogue. “Amputating history can make us lose our memory, which is one of the few remedies we have against repeating the mistakes of the past,” he wrote. Turning to the pandemic, Francis blasted people who protested anti-virus restrictions “as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom!” He accused some in the church and Catholic media of being part of the problem. “You’ll never find such people protesting the death of George Floyd, or joining a demonstration because there are shantytowns where children lack water or education,” he wrote. “They turned into a cultural battle what was in truth an effort to ensure the protection of life.” In urging the world to use the pandemic as an opportunity for a reset, Francis offers “three COVID-19” moments, or personal crises of his own life, that gave him the chance to stop, think and change course. The first was the respiratory infection that nearly killed him when he was 21 and in his second year at the Buenos Aires diocesan seminary. After being saved, Francis decided to join the Jesuit religious order. “I have a sense of how people with the coronavirus feel as they struggle to breathe on ventilators,” Francis wrote. The second COVID-19 moment was when he moved to Germany in 1986 to work on his thesis and felt such loneliness and isolation he moved back to Argentina without finishing it. The third moment occurred during the nearly two years he spent in exile in Cordoba, northern Argentina, as penance for his authoritarian-laced reign as head of the Jesuit order in the country. “I’m sure I did a few good things, but I could be very harsh. In Cordoba, they made me pay and they were right to do so,” he wrote. But he also revealed that while in Cordoba he read a 37-volume of the “History of the Popes.” “Once you know that papal history, there’s not that much that goes on in the Vatican Curia and the church today that can shock you,” he wrote. Francis repeated his call for a universal basic income, for welcoming migrants and for what he calls the three L’s that everyone needs: land, lodging and labor. “We need to set goals for our business sector that — without denying its importance — look beyond shareholder value to other kinds of values that save us all: community, nature and meaningful work,” he wrote.

15,Black Trans Artists Honor Victims Of Transphobic Violence In Powerful Music Video,social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost A trio of Black transgender women traverse a pandemic-shuttered New York in “But... I Survived,” a music video project aimed at honoring victims of transphobic violence. Set to the tune of Sia’s “Alive,” the “But... I Survived” video stars “RuPaul’s Drag Race” veteran Peppermint, singer-songwriter Mila Jam and makeup artist Deja “The Lady Deja Davenport” Smith. As they stroll through parks and ride the subway, each of the women glances wistfully at photographs of transgender people who have been murdered in recent years. They then drape themselves in an enormous transgender pride flag, surrounded by a troupe of masked dancers engaged in a socially distant routine. Watch the “But... I Survived” video above. Unveiled Friday to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance (Nov. 20), “But...I Survived” was directed and choreographed by John Alix in conjunction with NMAC, formerly known as the National Minority AIDS Council. Together with director of photography Josh Drake, Alix said he wanted to “pay respect to the transgender women who are no longer with us, and also scream to the viewer that trans women are alive, they are here, they’ve always been here, and it’s time to pay attention.” “We want people to see the humanity in these women,” he told HuffPost in an interview. “We so often put labels on who they are before we even know their story. They are strong, amazing, driven individuals who show us their soul every day, whether you recognize it or not.” Peppermint, who in 2017 was the runner-up on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and made her Broadway debut in the musical “Head Over Heels” the following year, shared similar sentiments. “The video either directly or indirectly addresses the lives of trans people of color, who are still today affected by an incredible amount of grief,” she said in an email. “And as heavy as this is on my heart, being able to gather with friends and fellow artists to create this meaningful video feels wonderful.” The release of “But... I Survived” comes at a challenging time for the transgender community. A Human Rights Campaign report published Thursday found that 2020 has already been the deadliest year on record for trans and gender-nonconforming people, with 37 known victims of violent deaths so far. Many members of the community have also been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with their access to both social support and gender-affirming health care significantly diminished. Still, many transgender people say they’re optimistic following Joe Biden’s defeat of President Donald Trump earlier this month. The president-elect’s Nov. 7 victory speech was the first ever to single out trans voters. On Friday morning, Biden acknowledged Transgender Day of Remembrance with a poignant note on Twitter. To transgender and gender-nonconforming people across America and around the world: from the moment I am sworn in as president, know that my administration will see you, listen to you, and fight for not only your safety but also the dignity and justice you have been denied. Regardless of the political climate, the cast and creative team behind “But...

0,Mother Of Civil Rights Activist Ruby Bridges Dies,social-justice," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Lucille Bridges, the mother of civil rights activist Ruby Bridges, who walked with her then-6-year-old daughter past crowds screaming racist slurs as she became the first Black student at her all-white New Orleans elementary school, has died at the age of 86, the city’s mayor announced Tuesday. Bridges gave birth to Ruby in Tylertown, Mississippi, in 1954 — the same year as the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, decision that ended racial segregation in schools. Her daughter went on to become an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, memorialized in Norman Rockwell’s famous painting “The Problem We All Live With” which depicts a tiny Ruby in a white dress carrying her notebooks and a ruler surrounded by much taller U.S. Marshals. But Ruby Bridges once credited her parents as the forces behind her history-making achievement. “My parents are the real heroes,” the U.S. Marshals Service once quoted her as saying during a ceremony at an art gallery showing the painting. “They (sent me to that public school) because they felt it was the right thing to do.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell recognized Lucille Bridges’ contributions in a statement Tuesday night. “Today we mourn the loss of one of the mothers of the Civil Rights Movement in New Orleans with the passing of Lucille Bridges — mother of five, including Ruby Bridges,” Cantrell said. “May she rest in God’s perfect peace.” Cantrell said Ruby’s father, Abon Bridges, was initially reluctant to send his daughter to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School as a first-grader in 1960, at the request of the NAACP. But his wife insisted. According to the National Women’s History Museum, Lucille Bridges wanted her daughter to have the education she never had. She walked her daughter to school every day, the museum said. “Lucille’s strength was unbounded during this period,” Cantrell said, adding: “Lucille insisted, seeing the action as an opportunity to help all Black children, and walked Ruby, with federal marshals, past chanting and taunting white protesters and to the schoolhouse. Mother and daughter both revealed their character and courage.” Bridges, too, endured hardship as she pushed for her daughter to receive an equal education, WGNO-TV reported. The news outlet said Bridges was born to sharecroppers in Mississippi and did not finish an elementary school education. But she was determined for her daughter to pursue the same opportunities that her white peers received. The Bridges eventually moved to New Orleans in search of better work and education opportunities for their family, according to the National Women’s History Museum. Abon Bridges died in 1978. An email and phone call to the The Ruby Bridges Foundation have not yet been returned. The image of Ruby from the Norman Rockwell painting has gotten renewed attention in recent days in an adapted version that shows Vice President-elect Kamala Harris walking alongside Ruby. Harris is the first Black woman elected to the vice presidency."
1,Poorest Countries Could Be Left Behind As Wealthy Nations Buy Up Covid Vaccine,social-justice," Politics news reporter, HuffPost UK Poor countries could be left behind in the fight against coronavirus as wealthier nations scramble to buy up doses of a potential Covid-19 vaccine, campaigners have warned. On Wednesday, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced its coronavirus vaccine had proven more than 90% effective in trials, leading one the of the UK government’s key scientific advisors to declare that life could be back to normal by spring. No.10 was quick to tell the public that the UK has procured 40m doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with 10m set to be manufactured by the end of the year if the jab is approved by regulators. The US has also secured a deal for 100m doses of the vaccine, with another 500m available if needed. But with Pfizer only able to produce 50m doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020 and another 1.3bn in 2021, global poverty charities and social justice campaigners have warned that people in the poorest parts of the world could be left at the back of the queue for the potentially life-saving vaccines. “Countries like the UK and US have already bulk bought a huge amount of the medicines, proving that fair global distribution has been set aside by the rich countries in their quest to get their hands on all potential vaccines first,” Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, told HuffPost UK. The campaign group has urged Pfizer and BioNTech to put its vaccine into a World Health Organisation (WHO) global patent pool, which would allow others to manufacture and distribute the jab and increase the number of people able to be vaccinated. Heidi Chow, the organisation’s pharmaceuticals campaigner, warned there was “nowhere near enough” of the Pfizer-manufactured vaccine to meet global demand. “We are heading towards artificially created scarcity for this vaccine which is completely unacceptable in a global pandemic,” she said. If Pfizer and BioNTech fail to share the vaccine patent, the WHO must suspend all patents on all Covid-19 medicines, Chow said. “This is a race against time and we cannot allow the pursuit of profit to triumph over human need.” Dr Albert Bourla, the chief executive of Pfizer, has previously dismissed the idea of Covid-related intellectual property pools, telling reporters in May: “I think it is nonsense and at this point of time it’s also dangerous. “There’s a giant effort right now happening to find a solution. The risks we are taking [represent] billions of dollars and the chances of developing something are still not very good. “So to have a discussion, to say keep in mind that if you discover [a vaccine or drug], we are going to take your IP, I think it’s dangerous,” he said. Global poverty charity Oxfam has added its voice to calls for Pfizer and BioNTech to share the patent for its coronavirus vaccine, saying the pandemic won’t come to an end “unless the vaccine is available and affordable to everyone”. “Pfizer’s estimated price for the vaccine is too high and the company cannot produce enough. The vaccine will be 0% effective to the people who can’t access or afford it,” said Niko Lusiani, Oxfam America’s senior advisor. “In a global pandemic of this magnitude, we must pursue a new path – a people’s vaccine that prioritises public health over private profits. “No one should have access to a life-saving vaccine only if they live in the right country or have enough money. Governments and corporations must work together to make all Covid-19 treatments and vaccines global public goods.” On Monday, Pfizer revealed it would be able to produce as many as 1.3bn doses in 2021. But it has already agreed to supply 120m doses of the vaccine to Japan, 40m to the UK, as many as 600m to the US and as many as 300m to the EU, across differing time scales. The charity Christian Aid has urged the UK government – along with other G20 governments – to get behind the campaign to make the vaccine accessible. “The UK and other G20 countries must support the WHO initiative, made at the World Health Assembly in May, to combine research and create a global patent pool, ensuring that all drugs related to the testing, treatment, prevention and response to Covid-19 are immediately accessible and genuinely affordable to all countries,” said Patrick Watt, the charity’s director of policy. “Today’s announcement could be a turning point in the battle to contain Covid-19 and reduce its huge toll of human suffering,” he added. “But for that to happen, governments must back the global call for a people’s vaccine that is available to poorer countries as well as the wealthiest. Access to any successful vaccine must not become a global postcode lottery.” But a spokesperson for Pfizer said the company’s decision-making during the pandemic “is not being driven by traditional cost/benefit analysis”. “During the pandemic, instead of using a traditional cost-effectiveness approach, we will price in a way that can help governments to ensure that there is little to no out-of-pocket costs for their populations,” they said. “Broad access is important – speed, safety and availability are driving us.” The spokesperson added: “It is important to note that our Covid-19 vaccine development and manufacturing costs have been entirely self-funded and we have already invested billions of dollars – and are prepared to continue bearing the costs of all development and manufacturing scale-up costs – in an effort to find a solution to this pandemic. “We are committed to making our Covid-19 vaccine accessible to those at highest risk of Covid-19. We are in discussions with Unicef and the Gates Foundation to provide doses to the Covax facility. Our intention through this potential collaboration is to provide doses to the poorer countries in the world.” BioNtech has yet to respond to HuffPost UK’s request for comment on this issue. The UK government has also been contacted for its response. Politics news reporter, HuffPost UK"
2,California Votes Down Proposition That Would Have Eliminated Cash Bail,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Californians voted against Proposition 25 in the Nov. 3 general election, which would have made the state the first in the nation to completely eliminate cash bail. As of Wednesday, with more than 11 million votes counted, 55% of Californians rejected the measure, versus 45% who supported it, The Associated Press reported. By voting against Prop 25, Californians shot down SB 10, a 2018 law that eliminated cash bail but never went into effect due to a bail bond industry campaign against it. Critics had raised concerns that the system that would replace cash bail — using risk-assessment tools and giving judges more discretion — could further perpetuate racism and other inequities in terms of who gets held in pretrial detention. Prop 25′s opponents included Human Rights Watch and the ACLU of Southern California. The groups warned about the racial bias embedded in risk-assessment tools that rely on data already skewed by the criminal justice system’s disproportionate criminalization of communities of color. Cash bail is meant, in theory, to ensure that people show up to trials and do not commit crimes until then. However, the system has long been criticized for exacerbating socioeconomic injustice, allowing rich defendants to pay for their release while poorer defendants, still presumed innocent, await trial in jail simply because they can’t afford to pay bail. There is also racism in the cash bail system, as in the criminal justice system as a whole. Studies have found that bail is systematically set at higher amounts for Black defendants than for white defendants facing similar charges and with similar criminal histories. With the law seeking to eliminate cash bail now struck down, there is no longer the option to end bail entirely in California by law. But criminal justice reform groups will certainly try other methods to change the current bail system, while also trying to avoid replacing it with other harmful approaches. ""We must end cash bail by addressing the deeper systemic problems, not by replacing it with automated bias and expanding law enforcement. Algorithms or cash bail is a false choice—we can and must do better."" #noonprop25 🚫25Read our full statement: https://t.co/ZMwcR5Fa6Q pic.twitter.com/cDEtLdeOFy The law Californians struck down would have replaced the state’s cash bail system with one that limited pretrial detention for many misdemeanors. For other misdemeanor or felony charges, judges would have evaluated defendants’ flight risk or threat to public safety using an algorithm-based risk-assessment tool. Risk-assessment tools factor in things like arrest records — and people of color, specifically Black people, are more likely to be arrested than whites for similar behavior. In July, Human Rights Watch slammed approval of Proposition 25 and the law it upholds as replacing “the injustice of money bail with an even more discriminatory pretrial system” that “uses racially biased risk assessment tools” and “gives judges nearly unlimited discretion to incarcerate.” Similarly, while the American Civil Liberties Union’s Northern California branch remained “neutral” on Prop 25, its Southern California branch vehemently opposed it, condemning “racist algorithms that do not improve pretrial justice.” An August analysis from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that the law “would likely achieve the goal of releasing more people sooner, but it would not address longstanding inequities in bookings and arrests.” The institute predicted that about 40% of people booked with misdemeanors who, under the current system, are held for over two days would instead get out in under 12 hours. However, it also predicted that about 49% of Black people booked would be held for risk assessment, versus 37% of whites. Other regions have previously implemented some degree of bail reform, including New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. New Jersey, which significantly reduced the use of money bail starting in 2017, has seen results that echo these predictions: A 2018 state report found that the number of people held pretrial dropped significantly, but the racial disparities in who is held largely stayed the same.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

11,John Oliver Nails The Really Sad Part Of Trump's Final Debate Performance,social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost John Oliver said the reaction to last week’s final debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden shows just how low the bar’s been set for Trump. Oliver played a clip of TV analysts praising the debate for being relatively normal, including CNN’s Becky Anderson who noted that “no one set themselves on fire” during the event. “Yeah, true,” Oliver cracked. “Although historically the bar for succeeding at these events has been a little higher than ‘nobody burned alive.’ This is a presidential debate, not a beginner’s fire-juggling class at the community center.” The host of “Last Week Tonight” said that even during last week’s seemingly normal debate (by Trump standards), the president still managed to let loose a stream of statements that “would’ve been an act of self-immolation” for anyone else. Trump, he said, lied throughout the debate, including a brazenly false claim that the nation was “rounding the turn” on the coronavirus pandemic despite sharply rising cases in much of the country. “What is really sad is that when people claim Trump was on his best behavior, that’s actually true,” Oliver said. “But his best behavior is still absolutely appalling.” Oliver also noted that when Trump declared himself “the least racist person in the room,” that room included members of his family. “So, he’s effectively throwing them under the bus there, too,” Oliver said. But much of Oliver’s show was focused on immigration, particularly the plight of those seeking asylum: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
12,Why Language Is One Of The Biggest Barriers To Home Ownership For Spanish-Speakers In The U.S.,social-justice," Buying a home is still a good way to build wealth in the U.S., and — especially for immigrants — it’s a large part of the dream of settling in and establishing roots. However, language remains one of the biggest barriers to ownership for many Hispanic and Latinx immigrants who move here from such Spanish-speaking countries as Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Spain and El Salvador. Not only is purchasing a home one of the biggest financial decisions a person or family can make in their life, but the complex process requires research and guidance — services not often provided in Spanish. According to a recent report by the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP), 33% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. are immigrants and their first language is Spanish. Spanish-speaking immigrants have more than $1.7 trillion in buying power, yet continue to be underserved and underrepresented because vital documents such as prerequisite explanations, loan applications, appraisal documents and closing contracts are rarely presented in Spanish. While experts have recently challenged the axiom that you need 20% saved for a down payment, there are still many costs associated with buying a first home. And because Hispanic and Latinx people are more likely to make less money than the national average, it takes them longer to save. This also means that they are buying homes later in life. There are 12.3 million Hispanic people aged 38-to-53 living in the U.S. who have worked and saved their way to establish home buying power, and these are precisely the people who need help navigating the process in their own language. But the issues they face once they enter the market include not having real estate professionals who can guide them and cater to their unique needs. The need to have a translator (whether a family member, friend or colleague) complicates the process, and NAHREP reports that the number of Spanish-speaking real estate professionals needs to double in order to keep up with the demand. The question remains: If realtors cannot help with translations and the needs of this community, how can home buyers truly understand the details around the process? Oftentimes, there are many questions that go unanswered during the initial home buying search that then deter families from moving forward with home buying. Many of these questions revolve around where to get started, how to apply for a mortgage loan, what is the required credit score and more. Mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage has created a Spanish language-based learning center to help first-time home buyers navigate the process. Some of the most important terms that require translation that those in the Latinx/Hispanic communities don’t often see or hear translated are mortgage (“hipoteca”), interest rate (“tasa de interés”) appraisal (“evaluación” or “tasación”), and escrow (“fideicomiso”). The Rocket Mortgage learning center is available in English and en Español and helps by answering in Spanish many frequently asked questions regarding the mortgage process. This opens up new opportunities for families to become better informed and further benefit from using loans to buy their first home in order to build wealth. With mortgage rates reaching historic lows, this year presents a big opportunity for first-time home buyers to enter the market. It’s a matter of finding the inclusive resources that will help individuals and families learn more about the process, no matter their original language. _____ From Rocket Mortgage: For more than 35 years, Rocket Mortgage has been simplifying the home loan process by designing it entirely around you.

13,Donald Trump Has Been Even Worse Than Everyone Expected,social-justice," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Senior World News Reporter, HuffPost Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost When Donald Trump kicked off his presidential bid in 2015, he rode down a golden escalator in Trump Tower, using the media attention to promote his own brand and property. He lied. He made racist comments. And he exaggerated the crowd size. In other words, he showed exactly the type of president he would become. The rest of his campaign was no different. He continued to stoke racial tensions, bully and demean. Unable to believe that he could truly be as bad as he presented himself, some Democrats thought maybe Trump would change once in office. Maybe there would be a way to work with him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said there were areas where Trump “voiced very progressive and populist opinions,” and perhaps those would be areas of cooperation. “I don’t think it makes sense to say, ’No, we’re not gonna work in any way in any form with the Trump administration,’” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said at the time. The late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was one of the few Democratic members willing to call Trump out and speak forcefully against him. Even before Trump’s inauguration, Lewis said he was not a “legitimate” president. Some Democrats supported Lewis, but plenty distanced themselves from him and said he had gone too far. Meanwhile, top Republican leaders, when asked about Trump’s rampant dishonesty during the course of the campaign, offered assurances that a Trump presidency would be different. They said the burdens of the Oval Office would weigh on him, and he’d have a competent team of aides. The Trump White House, they said, would function like most others. “I think many Republicans who held their nose and voted for Trump in 2016 thought he would at least be surrounded by seasoned staffers and career Republicans who would provide the policy road map for the administration,” said Jennifer Pierotti Lim, the co-founder of Republican Women for Progress, who endorsed Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. “But as we’ve seen, Republicans have abdicated their responsibility and instead of putting our country first, they have elevated Trumpism in all its forms.” Trump has been exactly the man he presented himself to be during the campaign, if not worse. He largely abandoned his populist promises to pursue the same trickle-down economic policies that are standard GOP fare. He has continued to make racist and sexist remarks ― and pursue those sorts of policies ― and has used the presidency to enrich himself and his family. Various Democrats told HuffPost that Trump has indeed been worse than they expected. “I thought he would be not just focusing on [infrastructure] but sustain the focus, would be in communities talking about ― just bridges, for example,” said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). “I thought he would use the opportunity to try to help rebuild the country. I thought he missed a big opportunity. Of course, I never thought he would abuse his power the way he did.” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said he expected Trump to at least try to get bipartisan agreement on some matters. “He just wasn’t interested in that at all,” Tester said. “It surprised me.” The lack of bipartisanship has been laid bare in the past few weeks as Trump, with the full support of Senate Republicans, has tried to push through Amy Coney Barrett to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. The vote is likely to come just one week before the election, although Republicans protested when President Barack Obama tried to fill the seat of the late Antonin Scalia months before the 2016 election. Trump personally lied about the size of his inauguration crowd on his first full day in office, standing before a memorial to agents killed in the line of duty at CIA headquarters. His press secretary repeated and embellished the lie later that afternoon, and the tone was set for the coming four years. To date, Trump has made tens of thousands of false statements, about matters great and small. A significant percentage of them have been lies: things that he has been told were false but that he repeated anyway, such as his claim that he signed into law the Veterans “Choice” Act, or that his tax cuts were the largest in American history. “If you look back to the 2016 campaign, every warning we made about Trump’s unique badness has seemingly come true ― but it’s not enough to just say ‘I told you so.’ Voters have to be shown the math,” said Ian Sams, who served as a spokesperson for Clinton’s presidential campaign. “Sadly, these past four years ― and especially the 2020 pandemic ― have revealed too clearly the depth of Trump’s fraudulent pitch as a tough, problem-solving leader, and most Americans now see him for the failure he is.” In many ways, Trump has turned out to be the worst version of what people feared. He has separated immigrant children from their parents, emboldened white supremacists, flattered strongmen who run dictatorships and treated the presidency like his own private business. “I often say there [were] many shocks but there was never a surprise,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2016. The consequences of his incompetence have been deadly. He may not have known the coronavirus was coming, but he could have been better prepared. And his inability, or unwillingness, to shepherd the country through the crisis has made his presidency even worse than some of his critics feared, as the death toll from the coronavirus rises to more than 220,000 Americans. A look at the some of the ways Trump has exceeded expectations on just how low he’d go: Trump began his campaign obsessed with immigration and vilifying immigrants. Undocumented immigrants, a majority of whom are Latino, Black or Asian, were not surprised that Trump followed through. “We knew who Donald Trump was,” said Greisa Martinez, executive director of United We Dream Action, the political arm of a Dreamer advocacy group. “We never thought that Trump wasn’t serious. We believed that he would drive a white nationalist agenda.” Soon after Trump took office, he enacted a disastrous travel ban for several Muslim-majority nations that left people stranded in airports or unable to reunite with their families. While the initial ban was blocked in court, Trump eventually found one that worked. He cut refugee resettlement to record low levels. He ended prioritization for deportations, putting more undocumented immigrants who live in the U.S. at risk of removal. He repeatedly went after so-called sanctuary cities that have policies to limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. He decimated the legal immigration system and raided Pentagon funds in order to pay for his border wall. Some of his most aggressive actions were reserved for migrants detained at the border ― including children. The Trump administration separated more than 4,200 kids from their parents at the border, without a plan to reunite them, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Hundreds of these families are still ripped apart. The administration put children in temporary holding facilities that looked like cages and locked up families for months. They chipped away at asylum and other legal relief in the courts, and ultimately implemented the “Remain in Mexico” program to force asylum seekers to wait across the border for hearings. Once the coronavirus pandemic started, the administration began to turn away people at the border entirely. That’s not even counting the things Trump wanted to do, but didn’t succeed in: changing “birthright citizenship” so babies born in the U.S. wouldn’t automatically be American citizens; ending the diversity lottery, which grants visas to people from nations the president derided as “shithole countries”; cutting family reunification visas that his allies dismiss as “chain migration”; and more. Although he was blocked in court from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the administration delayed renewals even after the Supreme Court ruling. Martinez wasn’t shocked at Trump’s ability to push white nationalist policies. But the way the rest of the government went along ― Congress, courts and federal agencies alike ― was dismaying. The “biggest surprise” for her, she said, was “the inability of the rest of our democratic system to be able to apply checks and balances.” Trump’s presidency has devastated the standing of the Justice Department and the FBI. From the beginning of his 2016 campaign, fueled by chants of “Lock her up” aimed at Clinton, Trump has treated the Justice Department as a means of protecting his political interests and punishing his political enemies. Trump has plowed through the normal restrictions meant to guide contacts between the White House and the Justice Department and prevent improper political interference in DOJ’s law enforcement mission. He’s unleashed an extensive campaign against the FBI, accusing the nation’s buttoned-up and conservative-leaning leading law enforcement bureau of being behind some secret cabal to take him down, and leaving the bureau to deal with the long-term, real-world impact on its reputation. Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey on a false pretext and forced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign. Attorney General William Barr, once thought to be an institutionalist who would stand up to improper political interference, instead protected the president from political harm by spinning and mischaracterizing the findings of Robert Mueller’s special counsel report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. As laid out in Mueller’s report, Trump worked to interfere in the investigation into wrongdoing. The only thing that protected Trump from a definitive accusation that he committed crimes was a Justice Department memo that found it was unconstitutional to indict a sitting president and improper to accuse Trump of committing crimes without formally charging him. Some Republicans hoped that the Mueller report ― as well as Trump’s impeachment for trying to pressure a foreign country to launch a politically damaging investigation against former Vice President Joe Biden ― would chastise the president and teach him a lesson. Yet just weeks before the election, Trump was publicly calling for the Justice Department to use its powers to attack Biden, his chief political rival. “We’ve gotta get the attorney general to act. He’s gotta act. And he’s gotta act fast. He’s gotta appoint somebody,” Trump said on Tuesday. “This is major corruption and this has to be known about before the election.” Trump retweeted a post this month to his 87 million followers suggesting that Biden and Obama “may have had Seal Team 6 killed,” and that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was still alive. A link in the post alleged that the person gunned down in the U.S. Special Forces’ raid on May 2, 2011, was not bin Laden but a body double. “I don’t take a position,” Trump later said in defense of the retweet. “I’ll put it out there, and people can decide for themselves.” Under normal circumstances, a sitting U.S. president pushing — and then defending — such a ludicrous conspiracy theory would be front-page news across the country and beyond. But throughout his time in office, and even before, Trump has openly embraced disinformation that is flattering to him or paints his rivals in a negative light, facts be damned. His Twitter account has become an integral part of the far right’s fake-news pipeline, with falsehoods worming their way from fringe websites to hyperpartisan social media influencers to media outlets such as the One America News Network and Fox News and, finally, to Trump’s retweets. Trump has amplified disinformation from the start. As he campaigned for the presidency in 2016, he aggressively zeroed in on the false, bad-faith notion that Obama was not a U.S.-born citizen — an already-debunked lie that he’d been promoting for years. Trump is now pushing a similarly untrue birther rumor about Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Among the dizzying list of other baseless or disproven conspiracy theories Trump has spread: MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough murdered his intern; Obama wiretapped Trump’s phones; windmills cause cancer; an anti-racist protester who suffered a brain injury at the hands of police faked his wounds; Bill Clinton killed Jeffrey Epstein; Biden is a pedophile. Now, with the election fast approaching, Trump has opened his arms to QAnon, the far-right conspiracy movement that claims a “deep state” cabal of Satan-worshipping Democrats is running an underground child sex ring with Hollywood elites. QAnon adherents believe Trump is single-handedly saving the world from this cabal, and Trump has repeatedly declined to deny this. He has referred to QAnon followers as “people that love our country.” As Trump has amplified conspiracy theorists, he has also emboldened far-right extremists. Earlier this month, the FBI charged a group of militia members ― most of them Trump supporters ― with plotting to violently kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. Trump had repeatedly condemned Whitmer for coronavirus lockdown measures, and in April tweeted “LIBERATE MICHIGAN.” After the plot was foiled, Trump continued to stoke hate, while a crowd at a Trump rally in Michigan chanted “Lock her up,” referring to Whitmer. Michigan may have narrowly avoided a violent extremist attack, but during the Trump administration, far-right violence has surged around the country. Domestic terrorism is the deadliest it has been in decades, and a resurgent far right is now one of the country’s biggest national security threats. White nationalist attackers have left manifestos that closely align with the same grievances Trump has fomented at rallies, in speeches and on Twitter. Many attackers have been open and enthusiastic Trump supporters, targeting groups, such as Muslims, immigrants and journalists, that the president constantly vilifies. Trump has sometimes given perfunctory condemnations of such violence, before immediately returning to fanning its flames. After neo-Nazis held a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, Trump claimed there were “very fine people” on both sides of the confrontation there. During the first 2020 presidential debate, Trump told the Proud Boys, a violent far-right gang, to “stand back and stand by.” Within hours, members of the group had added the slogan to their online profiles as they basked in the president’s approval. In Trump, far-right extremists and white nationalists have found a vehicle to mainstream their beliefs and turn them into policy. Fringe, racist ideology that had languished in far-right online spaces has been given a direct line into Trump’s White House, with leaked emails showing that adviser Stephen Miller recommended articles from white nationalist sites and abhorrently racist literature in exchanges with far-right media. Trump’s tacit embrace of white nationalists and the far right has made him an icon for extremists around the world. Researchers of the far right long ago began to look for MAGA symbolism in online profiles and groups, finding that it was one of the easiest ways of tracking extremism. German and Italian far-right politicians have posed in Trump hats, as did an extremist who killed six Muslim men at a Quebec City mosque in 2017. One of Trump’s avowed fans is the leader of a German far-right network that was stockpiling body bags and weapons as it planned to kill politicians who supported refugees. Trump’s mendacity has been matched by his personal corruption, as he’s used his office to funnel millions of taxpayer and donor dollars into his own pocket, as well as openly solicit money through his hotels and golf courses from both domestic and foreign interests that had business before his executive branch agencies. By insisting on visiting his own properties hundreds of times to play golf and for official and campaign trips, Trump put at least several million tax dollars into his own cash registers in the form of room rentals and meals for Secret Service and other government employees who must travel with him. The exact amount is not known, because the White House refuses to turn over those records. According to Federal Election Commission filings, Trump has also diverted $8 million in Republican donor money into his businesses since taking office. His golf clubs and hotels ― particularly his Washington, D.C., hotel just blocks from the White House ― became attractions for lobbyists who wanted Trump to know they were spending money that would benefit him personally. Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen, said he expected Trump would be corrupt when he was elected. “Still, it was hard to imagine the enormity and complete pervasiveness of the corruption we have experienced,” he said. “It was equally difficult to foresee that Trump and his administration wouldn’t even bother to hide the corruption ― from rampant abuses of the Hatch Act to putting a former coal lobbyist in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.” The blurred line between the presidency and Trump’s own personal interests was on full display this summer at the Republican National Convention, when Trump took the unprecedented step of giving his acceptance speech at the White House. Traditionally, presidents keep political rallies and activities separate from their official government functions. The convention ended with Trump and his supporters standing at the White House, watching a fireworks display over the Washington Monument. Many people who voted against Trump crossed their fingers that there wouldn’t be a serious national emergency during his term that would require true presidential leadership. But there was, and there is. The coronavirus pandemic has brought all of Trump’s incompetence into focus. Trump wasn’t prepared for a pandemic that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans and continues to grow worse. He has tried all his usual tactics of hiding it, blaming it on his enemies and slapping some different branding on it. But it’s not working. And this time, the consequences are deadly. From the early days, Trump knew how dangerous the virus was, telling journalist Bob Woodward on Feb. 7 that it was “deadly stuff.” But publicly, he downplayed it. He compared it to the flu and predicted it would go away on its own once April came, or when the weather warmed up. He also pushed quack coronavirus “cures” ― like taking the drug hydroxychloroquine or injecting bleach ― even after the medical community said they were ineffective or even dangerous. Meanwhile, he mocked masks and tried to push away and discredit the scientific community, which refused to get on board with his administration’s agenda of downplaying the virus’ severity. Getting sick himself didn’t change anything. Trump announced that he and his wife, Melania, had contracted the coronavirus on Oct. 1, after months of not wearing masks and continuing to hold events in person. He and his White House became superspreaders, with at least 35 people in his orbit testing positive for the virus. Yet while still sick at the hospital, he risked the life of Secret Service agents, and everyone else he came into contact with, when he left the building to ride around in the presidential motorcade and wave to supporters. He then left the Walter Reed medical center and returned to the White House ― even though he was still sick and contagious ― where he promptly took off his mask while standing on the balcony for photos. Since then, the White House has embraced the idea of allowing the virus to essentially spread unchecked, while trying to protect the elderly and vulnerable. Leading experts say this strategy is dangerous, and reaching the point of “herd immunity” is much further off than the administration seems to think it is. Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

14,Eyewitness Exposes 'Sick' Truth About Trump's Treatment Of Migrant Children,social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost President Donald Trump insists that hundreds of migrant children who were separated from their immigrant parents and held in detention centers are “so well taken care of.” But a reporter who saw how those kids are treated said that’s not the case at all. “What I saw there was little children sitting on concrete floors covered by Mylar blankets supervised by security contractors in a watchtower,” journalist Jacob Soboroff said on MSNBC after Thursday night’s debate. “It makes me sick every time I recall it.” Soboroff also shared audio of a child who hadn’t seen his father in almost three years: Monday I spoke with a still-separated father and son. The young man is eight now, living in CA with relatives and hasn’t seen his dad in nearly three years. @AlOtroLado_Org trying to reunite them. Listen to audio which aired on @NicolleDWallace’s show. pic.twitter.com/9OWaVpotKN Soboroff, who was among the group of reporters allowed to tour the facilities in 2018, wrote the book “Separated: Inside An American Tragedy” about Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy in which families coming across the border were separated. A federal court ordered an end to the separations and also ordered the U.S. government to reunite the children with their families. However, to date, at least 545 children are still living with foster families or distant relatives as the government has been unable to locate their parents, who were sent back to their home nations, often in Central America. “The government literally cannot find them,” Soboroff said. “They were warned they would not be able to find them. These families have been separated for over three years in some instances.” The Physicians for Human Rights said the children’s mistreatment meets the United Nations definition of torture, Soboroff said. The American Academy of Pediatrics called it “government-sanctioned child abuse.” “And the president of the United States I guess interprets that as children being well taken care of,” he said. Trump also claimed the Obama administration had a similar policy, but Soboroff fact-checked that as well. “No one else ever did this,” he said. “This was uniquely a Trump administration policy.” Overnight Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Trump Says Migrant Children Separated From Their Parents Are ‘Well Taken Care Of’,social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost President Donald Trump’s administration started and carried out a policy that took more than 4,000 children from their parents, at least 545 of whom are still split apart years later. But at Thursday’s debate, the president insisted that he did nothing wrong at all ― blaming his Democratic predecessors and even insisting the kids are doing fine. “They are so well taken care of,” Trump said of the children taken from their parents by his administration. “They’re in facilities that were so clean.” Trump’s first term was marked by a full-out assault on immigration, both legal and unauthorized. The most dramatic was his “zero tolerance” policy on unauthorized border-crossing, used in a 2017 pilot program and expanded more broadly in 2018, that led to criminal prosecution of parents and locking up their kids separately. Splitting up families was intentional and calculated, according to multiple reports. Thanks to mass public outrage and a court order, Trump was forced to stop his family separation policy. Most families were reunited, but the American Civil Liberties Union, which was part of the lawsuit against the government that stopped the policy, said this week that at least 545 kids are still away from their parents. “Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said during the debate. “And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal.” Moderator Kristen Welker asked Trump twice how these families would be reunited. Instead of answering the first time, he complained about “bad people” and “cartels” bringing children to the U.S., and boasted about his border wall. The second time Welker asked if he had a plan to reunite families, Trump said only, “Yes, we are trying very hard.” Then he launched into discussing who is, in his mind, the real victim: himself. He complained that people referenced kids being held in “cages,” which he said were actually created by Biden and President Barack Obama. “They did it,” Trump said. “We changed the policy.” Biden and Obama do not have a spotless immigration record ― they carried out record deportations and presided over an influx in migrants, including unaccompanied kids, at the border who were at times temporarily held in poor conditions. During those major influxes, children were photographed in fenced-in temporary holding centers, similar to the “cages” criticized under Trump. But the idea that Biden was too tough on immigrants is a laughable argument from Trump. The Obama-Biden administration did not systematically separate families as a deterrent. It created new deportation priorities to deemphasize people with deep ties to the U.S. It created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, to allow so-called Dreamers who came to the U.S. as kids to stay. It pushed for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship, and for another deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. It expanded refugee resettlement. Trump, by contrast, eliminated deportation priorities. He tried to end DACA. He has held any immigration bills hostage to his desire to build a wall and slash legal immigration. He cut refugee resettlement. And, whether he wants to discuss it or not, he presided over the separation of thousands of children, including newborns, from their parents. As Biden noted, the discussion of “cartels” was a distraction. “They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with,” Biden said. He added later, “Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents, and it makes us a laughing stock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.” Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Hundreds Of Parents Separated From Their Kids Under Trump Still Can't Be Found: ACLU,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Lawyers tasked with identifying and reuniting families separated in 2017 and 2018 under the Trump administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” border policy say they still haven’t been able to locate the parents of at least 545 migrant children, according to a Tuesday court filing from the American Civil Liberties Union. A majority of these parents — “approximately two-thirds,” the filing said — are believed to have been deported to Central America without their children, some of whom were “just babies” at the time of the separation, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told CNN this week. We just reported tonight to the court in #aclu case that we still cannot find parents of 545 kids separated by Trump admin - some just babies when taken years ago. We will not stop till we find EVERY one Between 2017 and 2018, the Trump administration separated at least 4,200 children from their parents — and, according to the ACLU, U.S. immigration officials deported hundreds of these parents without their kids, and often without retaining adequate contact information. Thousands of separated families have since been reunited, thanks to the efforts of the ACLU and other organizations. Gelernt said the ACLU, which is part of a court-appointed “steering committee” that’s been tracking down families separated under the Trump administration policy, is determined to help reunite every affected child with their loved ones. But the process of locating separated parents has been arduous, he said. “People ask when we will find all of these families and, sadly, I can’t give an answer. I just don’t know,” Gelernt told NBC News, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic had further complicated the search process. “But we will not stop looking until we have found every one of the families, no matter how long it takes. The tragic reality is that hundreds of parents were deported to Central America without their children, who remain here with foster families or distant relatives.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,The Pandemic Has Benefited One Group Of People: Billionaires,social-justice," Senior Enterprise Reporter, HuffPost Other than Netflix, Andrew Cuomo and the virus itself, no one has benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic more than American billionaires. Over the last six months, roughly 3 out of 4 members of America’s 10-digit-wealth club have seen a rise in their net worths. Sixteen American billionaires are worth at least twice as much now as they were in March. And Jeff Bezos, who was already worth $113 billion at the start of 2020, is heading into the year’s final stretch $73 billion richer, according to data from Forbes analyzed by the progressive groups Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies. The same data shows that Michael Bloomberg and Charles Koch are both up by $7 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg has added another $46 billion to his already staggering $54 billion in wealth. Elon Musk found time between COVID truther tweets and CPAP machine donations to take his fortune from $25 billion to $92 billion. Some billionaires have gotten richer as a direct result of the pandemic. Amazon, for example, was one of the few companies in the United States to expand as consumers locked down at home and avoided brick-and-mortar retail. Facebook, Google, Tesla and Microsoft have also boomed in the past six months, adding to the fortunes of their respective billionaire founders. Most billionaires, however, have grown their wealth not as business leaders but as investors. One of the ongoing mysteries of the COVID-19 recession is why it has — so far at least — barely touched the stock market. After falling roughly 35% in February, both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 returned to pre-pandemic levels in just 126 trading days, a turnaround that may be the fastest ever recorded. Others benefited directly from government relief funds, a significant portion of which went to large companies. Musk is among the billionaires who have increased their wealth by attracting investors who are betting that their companies will come out of the recession stronger than when they went in. There are also larger forces at play. The pandemic wealth gap is a culmination of America’s decadeslong trend of increasing inequality. Since 1980, taxes on billionaires have fallen 79%. Unions, which help workers negotiate for a larger share of profits, represented roughly 1 in 4 workers in 1979, but now represent only 1 in 10. Nor is this the first time the wealthy have benefited from an economic disaster. After the 2008 recession, billionaires not only restored their wealth within three years, they managed to nearly double it again by 2018. The bottom 80% of income earners still haven’t recovered. Whatever the long- and short-term reasons, though, the net worth of the wealthiest Americans is becoming increasingly unmoored from conditions in the country around them. Just over 11 million Americans lost their jobs between February and August 2020. Thirty-nine states have lost more jobs in 2020 than they did during the Great Recession. But as workers lose their jobs and struggle to pay rent, their bosses and landlords are still, somehow, winning big. WebAR experience produced by Rebecca Zisser.

2,"Facebook Decides Holocaust Denial Content Is Bad, Actually",social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost Facebook has, for years, intentionally looked the other way when users shared content that denied or distorted the Holocaust. That may finally be changing. Facebook’s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said Monday the company is updating its hate speech policy to prohibit Holocaust denials and distortions. A “well-documented rise in anti-Semitism globally and the alarming level of ignorance about the Holocaust, especially among young people,” Bickert said, prompted the long-overdue change. The announcement makes no mention of how Facebook itself contributed to that anti-Semitic rise. The social media platform has become a clearinghouse for misinformation concerning virtually every subject, including Holocaust denials and anti-Semitism in general. It’s unclear how Facebook intends to enforce the expanded policy, or how it will define content that violates it. “Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight,” Bickert acknowledged in the announcement. “There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement.” The company told HuffPost it will apply the policy to all of its users, including politicians. Politicians have enjoyed lax enforcement of Facebook’s community standards, thanks to a loophole the social media company created that protects their posts as “newsworthy content.” Facebook had resisted calls to take down Holocaust denial content going back to at least 2011, when 21 Holocaust survivors pleaded with the company to deny access to users who promoted the conspiracy theory that Nazis didn’t murder 6 million Jews during WWII. “By allowing this hate propaganda on Facebook,” the group warned the company in a letter, “you are exposing the public and, in particular, youth to the anti-Semitism which fueled the Holocaust.” Facebook, at the time, nevertheless decided Holocaust denials didn’t violate its terms. A Facebook spokesperson declined to address why the company suddenly reversed course, but it’s clear Facebook is coming to terms with the role it’s played in radicalizing groups, sometimes with violent ends. After a teen vigilante was accused in the shooting deaths of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the summer, Facebook acknowledged it erred in taking no action against militia groups that used the platform to plot violence and encourage each other to “shoot to kill.” In recent weeks, the company has also drastically increased its policing of QAnon content, and now bans all groups, pages and Instagram accounts that openly identify with the Trump-supporting conspiracy theory. The FBI has classified the group as a potential domestic terrorism threat. National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Black Creatives Drive Change Through ‘Art Is Revolution’,social-justice," Art and media are powerful catalysts for change, and in a year marked by the fight for racial justice, the work of Black artists feels more poignant than ever. HuffPost has teamed up with RYOT, Verizon Media’s immersive storytelling production house, and All Black Creatives, a foundation and agency that celebrates and empowers Black creatives, to bring you a unique virtual exhibit we’re calling “Art Is Revolution (AIR).” This immersive 3D exhibit showcases the work of groundbreaking Black artists in a year of racial reckoning, curated by Danielle Elise, founder of All Black Creatives. “In this moment — an election, a global pandemic, a corporate cultural awakening — as Black folks, our bodies and minds are stretched thin,” Elise said. “Not only are we stretching to survive, we are also having to educate and bear the burden of a world around us that is just waking up to the work to be done.” So Elise picked several restorative themes — Lift Every Voice, Healing, Black Joy and Future — and selected 21 artists whose work stood out for “giving image, voice, compassion, honesty, sound, truth and reflection to the revolution,” she said. “Honest art — that’s what I look for.” Each week of this four-part series, you’ll find artwork from multidisciplinary Black creators, including photographers, musicians, writers, poets, sculpturists and more. “Each artist in this show is tied together by the same thread — every single artist possesses a passion and an honesty that I knew this project needed,” Elise said. “Their art IS their revolution. This message rang so clear for every single artist and every piece curated.” Click on the “Launch AR” button above to be taken to a 3D gallery experience and make sure to hit the “Sound On” icon at the top right of your screen to hear the artists talk about their work. 


On desktop, use your mouse or touchpad to zoom and rotate each 3D object. On mobile, you can also view the artwork in your own space and walk around them. Use two fingers to resize and rotate each exhibit. Using a variety of technologies, including drone-captured photogrammetry, we have transformed these artworks into augmented reality exhibits that you can explore and interact with. Using your mobile phone, you can even bring these pieces, virtually, into your own space. The first theme, Lift Every Voice, pays homage to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song — also known as the Black National Anthem — written originally as a poem by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson. “This theme centers on art that represents the revolution, highlights the Black Lives Matter gatherings in the streets,” Elise said. “Our Black women matter, our Black queer and trans family matters, our Black men matter, and so we ‘lift every voice.’ It is both a call to action and a reflection of that action.” Noel Spiva My AIR video highlights so many talented artists featured in a setting that visually announces the connection of art and technology made and created by Black creatives. This piece introduces archival footage of Black painters and sculptors while entering a new platform of today’s artists that are continuing to lead the way. Above: One of Noel Spiva’s video piece for AIR. It’s the kick-off to the celebration of black voices told through art and sounds that speaks to the time. The music featured in my video is produced by artist Mad Keys, with an accompanying voice of St. Louisan Ohun Ashe amongst a crowd of passionate voices chanting a famous quote by Assata Shakur: “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” Jonny Brooks I strive to capture real life, real moments, and real people. As a Black photographer, I hope to use the camera as a way to magnify Black life, Black culture, and Black creativity at its best. Below: One of Jonny Brooks’ photographs. Heather Polk I create my art from the heart, from my lived experiences, curiosities, and love of magazines, art, and remixed images. My finished pieces are usually a result of conversations, moods and studies of a variety of subject matter. Below: One of Heather Polk’s pieces. I am very conscious about the visibility of Black people in art and want my work to evoke positive and powerful feelings about Black life. Creativity unleashed rewards every soul. My soul is rewarded every moment I have to sit down and create art. Cami Thomas When capturing an image, I love knowing that the person in front of the lens has now been etched into a particular moment in history. As time is moving, and fleeting, I want to do my due diligence as an artist to showcase things as they currently are while adorning the design in elements that also show what the future could look like. Above: One of Cami Thomas’ pieces. These particular pieces allowed me to play with my own feelings of nostalgia for the past and daydreaming of the future. When speaking to my grandfather, my friends, or to children, I feel inspired by the stories of what they’ve overcome. I feel inspired by the light, untouched nature of what we could build in the future. Blackness is often depicted in a way that puts pain at the forefront, but I want to create pieces that make me feel the same way I feel when I’m with my community; hopeful, light, creative, abundant and filled to the brim with love. The pieces feel a bit whimsical as if they’re a fantasy or stills from an elaborate dream, which is true to the nature of the way me and my friends experience life. Mawhyah Milton I use my artwork to express vital activism through the lens of a Black woman that words often fail to define. I love using bold color, portraiture and symbolism to illustrate what it means to be Black – the good, the bad and the unexplained. Above: One of Mawhyah Milton’s pieces. It wasn’t until I joined the AmeriCorps after graduating that I began to learn more in depth about the intersections of oppressive systems and combine what I learned with my own story and the voices of my family and those who look like me. As I became more confident in my voice and myself, my use of color became more vibrant and bolder. Now I use art to contribute to the zeitgeist by creating imagery about human, social, and political issues. My work evolved as it became more true. It has become bolder and louder because I am screaming. The pieces I create, I try to convey as viscerally as possible so anyone looking at it will understand.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Links Kidnapping Plot To Trump's Hate Rhetoric,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer drew a strong line between an alleged plot to kidnap her and the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, whose recent comments have been interpreted by right-wing militia groups as encouragement. “Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups,” Whitmer, a Democrat, said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. Six men involved with a militia group called Wolverine Watchmen are facing federal charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and an additional seven people are facing state charges in connection with the alleged scheme. The men wanted to “storm” the state Capitol in Lansing with 200 men to take hostages including the governor, court documents say. Whitmer said Thursday that the suspects aimed to “possibly kill” her. Trump failed to speak out against hate groups during his first presidential debate with Democratic contender Joe Biden last Tuesday. Pressed to condemn the Proud Boys, a group of violent right-wing extremists, Trump replied: “Proud boys, stand back and stand by.” Members of the Proud Boys quickly turned the president’s words into a T-shirt and other merchandise. Trump also deflected criticism at the debate by claiming ― against the analysis of his own top law enforcement officials ― that the problem comes mainly “from the left wing, not the right wing.” The FBI warned as recently as two weeks ago that right-wing militia groups pose a “violent extremist threat,” particularly as the election approaches. “Hate groups heard the president’s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry — as a call to action,” Whitmer said. She continued: “When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet with, encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions, and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany responded to Whitmer in a statement claiming that Trump “has continually condemned white supremacists and all forms of hate,” and that the Michigan governor was “sowing division.” Trump has danced around hate groups that profess to support him throughout his presidency; it took him two days after the debate to say the words “I condemn all white supremacists,” which he eventually did on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program. Whitmer had been attacked by the president at the start of the coronavirus crisis for issuing strict lockdown orders that are credited with preventing statewide outbreaks. In April, Trump reacted to news of Michigan lockdowns by tweeting, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN.” Heavily armed Michiganders began showing up in Lansing around that time to intimidate lawmakers and demand an end to lockdown measures. When asked by reporters whether he thought Trump’s tweet had influenced militias like Wolverine Watchmen, Biden responded Thursday afternoon, “Yes, I do.” “Why won’t the president just say ‘stop. Stop, stop, stop,’” Biden said. One of the men charged with plotting against Whitmer, Adam Fox, called her a “tyrant bitch” in a private Facebook group, according to the FBI. “Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin’ Governor. Just grab the bitch,” Fox allegedly wrote. He is currently facing life in prison. Whitmer called the decisions she has had to make in the pandemic “gut-wrenching,” adding that “2020 has been a hard year for all of us.” “It’s been hard for the teachers, students and parents. Hard for those who have had to stay isolated to stay safe. But here’s what I know. We are Michiganders. We have grit. We have heart. And we are tough as hell,” she said.

12,Thousands Protest Anti-Coronavirus Restrictions In Germany Over Weekend,social-justice," BERLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of demonstrators in southern Germany protested against coronavirus restrictions over the weekend, police said on Sunday, although organizers failed to mobilize enough people for a planned human chain around Lake Constance. Thousands of counter-demonstrators in Constance also turned out to show support for the government’s measures to contain the coronavirus while also protesting against right-wing supporters in the other group, police said.Overall, police counted between 10,500 and 11,000 people taking part in the different demonstrations on Saturday and the two-day protests continued on Sunday with sunny weather likely to draw in further participants, a police spokesman said. “So far, the situation is calm,” the police spokesman added. Organizers of the protests against coronavirus curbs had initially hoped to mobilize more than 200,000 people. Local authorities had imposed restrictions such as respecting social distancing to avoid further infections. They also banned the use of Germany’s imperial Reichsflagge, a symbol used by neo-Nazis and other far-right groups as an alternative to the forbidden swastika flag. The marches have attracted a mixed crowd of civil rights activists and people who oppose vaccinations, as well as neo-Nazis and members of far-right groups including the opposition party Alternative for Germany (AfD). During mass marches against coronavirus curbs in Berlin in late August, protesters stormed the steps of the Reichstag parliament building, some of them holding far-right Reichsflagge. The images went around the world and were condemned by leading German politicians. Germany so far has managed the COVID-19 pandemic relatively well by keeping infections and deaths low compared to other European countries during the first wave in spring. But infection numbers are rising again and authorities are mulling further restrictions which could limit public life and slow down the economic recovery after Germany suffered its worst recession on record in the first half of the year.

13,Trump’s Presidency Will Impact Refugees Long After He Leaves Office,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost President Donald Trump has spent years dismantling the refugee system and now has dealt what could be his final blow on Wednesday when he proposed cutting the already record-low admissions cap to 15,000 for the next fiscal year. And even if he loses the election in November, it will be hard to quickly undo the damage. Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic challenger, pledged to raise the maximum number of refugee admissions to 125,000 a year if he wins. While he could change the target number for admissions with comparative ease, Biden would face a series of challenges, including restoring a resettlement infrastructure that has faced layoffs and closures due to cuts forced by the Trump administration. “It’s a system that has experienced death by a thousand cuts. Year after year, the infrastructure is decimated,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, the president, who must first consult Congress, determines the yearly refugee cap. Trump’s proposal, which was submitted quietly before the start of the new fiscal year at midnight Wednesday night, “reflects the Administration’s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” the State Department website noted. This is in line with Trump’s longtime animosity toward refugees, whom he has accused of being dangerous, without evidence. At a campaign rally in Minnesota on Wednesday, he said that “another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden’s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees.” Refugees have become a political pawn, demonized by those in the White House, while in reality most refugees are escaping humanitarian crises and even death. Since Trump took office and severely limited the entry of refugees, hundreds of thousands of families have been kept apart, people seeking medical attention have been denied entry, and some families have been forced to make the difficult decision to leave the U.S. just to be with their families. The number of admitted refugees has since steadily declined under the Trump administration, with 2020 marking a historic low. Trump slashed the refugee admissions cap from 110,000 ― a number set by President Barack Obama during his last year in office ― to a mere 45,000 during the 2018 fiscal year. That number was sliced again to 30,000 in the 2019 fiscal year and 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year. The U.S. only admitted roughly 11,000 refugees in 2020 due to border closures during the first few months of the pandemic ― and even before the pandemic, the number of actual admissions has been well below the caps set under Trump. “We’ll see the ultimate deathblow to a system that has literally saved millions of lives for more than four decades.” Refugee agencies are concerned that if Trump is reelected, those numbers will continue to take a hit, further decimating the federal program and continuing to keep out vulnerable populations who are fleeing persecution and humanitarian crises. “We’ll see the ultimate deathblow to a system that has literally saved millions of lives for more than four decades,” Vignarajah added. The low number of refugees comes at a time when global displacement trends are at an all-time high. Nearly 80 million people around the world have been forcibly displaced, and 26 million of them are refugees. In 2017, more than two-thirds of all refugees worldwide came from five countries ― Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Venezuela ― all of which Trump has restricted entry from through his multiple travel bans. The current plan also proposes not admitting any refugees from Somalia, Syria and Yemen, with exceptions for “those who have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of religion” ― essentially only allowing Christian minorities, a move that advocates say is discriminatory. The proposal also makes exceptions for refugees from Iraq who helped the United States; and for refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Cuba and Venezuela. “For refugees who have felt the instability of years of relocating with anxiety waiting for good news, for America to essentially shut the door in their faces is exactly what we’re doing through this kind of presidential determination number,” said Vignarajah. If Biden wins, he would not only need to deal with staffing issues, but would also need to prepare for any resistance from anti-immigrant groups who want to challenge new admissions in the courts, especially if Trump is able to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice ― all of which could hinder or delay changes set by Biden. “There’s a lot he needs to do to get this system up and running, because the people in there now are not interested in facilitating refugee resettlement in a good way,” said Yael Schacher, the senior U.S. advocate at Refugees International. Schacher noted there is already a pipeline of people who have been approved for resettlement but are not able to physically relocate, a situation that can be addressed fairly quickly during a Biden presidency. She also said she hopes Biden will ease restrictions on asylum-seekers and refugees alike in order streamline the immigration maze that’s currently stacked against them. Ultimately, those who are being disproportionately affected by these binary limitations are refugees from Muslim and Black populations, said Nazanin Ash the vice president of global policy and advocacy for the International Rescue Committee. Refugee agencies on the ground are ready to receive and process refugees with the support of their local politicians and communities, Ash added. “Vulnerability hasn’t decreased. The scale of the crisis hasn’t decreased. The needs of these populations haven’t decreased,” said Ash. “Nothing about their vulnerability has changed. They have followed all the rules. They have met all of the security checks. They have been proceeding through the process and they wake up tomorrow and they’re Somali or Syrian and they’re no longer eligible for the program.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,There’s A Better Way To Get Justice For Sexual Assault Survivors,social-justice," Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost The criminal justice system has historically failed survivors of sexual violence. And it’s easy to make that conclusion when reading the statistics: Three out of four sexual assaults are not reported to police, often for survivors’ fear of being victim-blamed. Out of the cases that are reported to police, 13% get referred to prosecutors. And only 7% of those cases lead to a felony conviction. But what if there was a better approach to getting justice for victims of sexual assault? Dr. Mary Koss, a Regents’ Professor at University of Arizona’s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, illustrates multiple justice alternatives in a new report released Friday, published by Data For Progress and the Justice Collaborative Institute. Currently, there are a very limited number of options for victims seeking justice, but by implementing restorative justice ― an alternative method to addressing harm by relying on community members instead of the criminal system ― survivors could have a say in what type of justice they’re seeking and how they receive it. “The criminal justice system is a pipeline, and it has leaks all along the way,” Koss told HuffPost, adding that only “a drop of consequence comes out.” “The criminal justice system is a pipeline, and it has leaks all along the way.” Using restorative justice practices could fix that leaky pipeline, Koss said. Out of a survey of over 1,000 U.S. voters, 69% said they would support making mental health and trauma-related services available to survivors who choose not to report to police. Nearly 60% of all respondents supported reallocating funds from law enforcement to support financing those victim services. Last month, HuffPost spoke to more than a dozen survivors of sexual assault about the debate over defunding police. All of them said police usually ended up re-traumatizing them instead of helping them find justice. Many of the survivors said they’d like to see more restorative justice alternatives implemented in the current criminal system, telling HuffPost that many social services that could receive a reallocation of funding from downsized police budgets are the very types of services victims need when they report: mental health, addiction services and other trauma-informed social services. HuffPost spoke with Koss about alternative justice options beyond what our criminal system currently offers. Can you walk me through how the criminal justice system often fails sexual assault survivors? It starts with when victims make their first decision, which is, are they going to report to the police or not? And that often depends on how they believe they’re going to be treated. Police officers are people and they make their decisions based on the same grounds that many other people do: their response to sexual assault victims can be steeped in myths and stereotypes. They can be trained to be more sensitive, but their job is to get at the evidence. And it’s fairly hard to do that ― no matter how good your training is ― without being somewhat harsh. So if you look at the cases that police decide ― whether they just don’t have the resources to investigate or they, frankly, don’t believe the victim ― that pile will have too many minorities, too many people with substance abuse issues and too many people with mental illness problems. But it has to be recognized that police aren’t the only part of the criminal justice system. They’re just the beginning of it. Any case that survives police investigation goes to prosecutors, where they often apply those same perspectives or biases again. In addition, they think about: “Can we win this case in a courtroom?” Because if they can’t, they won’t waste their resources on it. When you put this all together, what we’ve got is an adversarial justice system, where the purpose of the system is to uncover the evidence, weigh the evidence, assign culpability and set punishment. The criminal justice system is woefully inadequate to address the crime of sexual assault. There’s been a lot of discussion around the movement to defund the police. Although sexual assault survivors have a spectrum of experiences with law enforcement, how would you approach the conversation around defunding the police in relation to alternative justice options for victims? If I had to put it in my words, it would be: Reallocate VAWA [Violence Against Women Act] money. Yes, I don’t think police should be working as social workers. But I don’t think that sexual assault survivors are asking police to work as social workers. Some of the VAWA money does go to police and it trickles down to the local policing level. I believe that money should be up for discussion about whether it’s being used in the best way. I got some of that money once and I had to go to a hearing and listen to who else was competing for it. One of the other proposals was to buy one of those great big riot vans and get it all tripped out. Luckily, there was the right person in the right place who said maybe we don’t need that tank and we could actually help some people who are working towards restorative justice. We have to take a look at the VAWA money. Where is it going? I don’t believe that the money for restorative justice should come from taking money solely away from police departments. The role police play in sexual assault, although it’s a critical gatekeeper function, is again just the first part of the system. How would a restorative justice option help fix our “adversarial” justice system? Restorative justice is also about holding people accountable. In the U.S., since we have such a high incarceration rate compared to the rest of the world, we think the only way to take crime seriously is to put people in prison. The process believes in holding people accountable in meaningful ways that are community based. The only thing I would like to emphasize is that not all wrongdoers are willing to take even the slightest bit of responsibility for what they did. And those people unfortunately can’t be dealt with in restorative justice, because restorative justice is for people who seek a process that helps. Would you say restorative justice is a more victim-centered approach? I’m having this internal struggle, because restorative justice doesn’t advertise itself as being victim-centered. It visualizes itself more as a triangle. The current adversarial justice system is seen as having basically one customer and that’s the defendant. And it’s the justice system’s job to put that person, if possible, in prison. The victim is not seen as a customer of the criminal justice system. So the victim doesn’t get good service necessarily because you’re not a customer. You’re just there as an assistant to do their job, observing their customer ― the defendant. “The current adversarial justice system is seen as having basically one customer and that’s the defendant. And it’s the justice system’s job to put that person, if possible, in prison. The victim is not seen as a customer of the criminal justice system ... You’re just there as an assistant to do their job, observing their customer ― the defendant.” Restorative justice was created to say that justice shouldn’t just focus on the wrongdoer, justice has to focus on the wrong as well as on the wrongdoer. Restorative justice is often illustrated as a triangle where it’s got victim, wrongdoer and community because you have to balance the needs of all three. It’s certainly better for victims: it gives them more choice, more control over the process, more flexibility to shape the process, and it provides them with a validating environment. There are many, many ways in which it is set up to be a better experience for victims. But it’s not set up that way at the expense of denying due process to the wrongdoer or at the expense of putting the community at risk from having unsafe people running around. I recently had a conversation with a sexual assault survivor for an article about defunding the police. She said something that’s really stuck with me: She initially chose not to report her abuser because she believed he would be sexually assaulted in prison, essentially reinforcing and perpetuating the very violence he perpetrated himself. Altruism of victims is important to note here. Oftentimes if people who are looking to hold their wrongdoer accountable were given a list of possible consequences, most would not select “I want this person to go to prison.” But unfortunately, we have a system set up that has a very limited menu. We don’t really have an alternative that’s available to sexual assault victims. Often this forces victims to take justice into their own hands by writing guys’ names on bathroom walls and keeping social media lists of fraternities that have rapists in them. Those are some of the ways people have struggled to find alternative systems of justice. What do you hope people take away from your report? We need to make sure we’ve connected or reconnected with the voices of the victims we are supposedly serving. We have to be prepared for the fact that justice is a luxury. If you’ve got money problems, food problems, housing problems, day care problems, transportation problems, employment problems, you can’t afford the luxury of justice. It’s not appealing to you. So when we are creating alternative justice options we have to think in that broader perspective. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Need help?

0,White Supremacist Who Yelled ‘Go Back To Africa’ Before Hate Crime Shooting Sentenced To 25 Years,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost A Maryland judge on Wednesday sentenced white supremacist Brandon Higgs to four decades behind bars for charges related to the 2018 shooting and wounding of a Black man, with part of the sentence suspended. John Magee, the prosecutor for the Baltimore County state’s attorney’s office, told HuffPost that the judge in the case suspended 15 years of the sentence during the ruling, meaning Higgs will likely serve 25 years behind bars, plus five years probation. The 26-year-old former Navy cryptologist was found guilty in January of first-degree assault, attempted voluntary manslaughter, hate crimes and related firearms charges stemming from the 2018 shooting in Reisterstown, a suburb of Baltimore. “He’s got a long time to think about the shit he did,” Elvis Smith, the man Higgs shot, told HuffPost after leaving the sentencing hearing Wednesday morning. “So I’m happy.” The shooting received national attention because of the heinous nature of the crime, and because private online chat logs obtained by anti-fascists showed Higgs was active in organized white supremacist groups and had expressed a murderous hatred for Black people, particularly those in the Baltimore area. On Dec. 20, 2018, 60-year-old Smith and 48-year-old Robert Peete were at work laying concrete on a driveway outside a house in Reisterstown. A dog belonging to Higgs, who lived nearby, got loose and ran through the wet concrete. The three men exchanged some angry words before Higgs returned home. Higgs re-emerged outside minutes later carrying a loaded gun and made racist remarks to Smith and Peete. “This is my hood,” he said, using a racial slur. He added: “Black motherfuckers, go back to Africa!” A shoving match broke out between Smith and Higgs, before Smith hit Higgs with a small rake used for smoothing concrete. Higgs then drew his gun and a tussle over the weapon ensued. Peete told HuffPost he remembers Higgs pointing the gun directly in his face. Peete said he managed to get out of the way of the weapon. At some point during the struggle, the gun went off, the bullet ripping through Smith’s leg and obliterating his tibia. (At Higgs’ trial later, it was never established whether he fired the gun or it went off accidentally.) Smith and Peete then managed to disarm and restrain Higgs until police arrived. As Higgs awaited trial, where he pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges, anti-fascists uncovered comments Higgs had made in private neo-Nazi chat groups, including a group for people planning to attend the deadly 2017 “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The comments, some of which are quoted below, included racial slurs. “I decided I’m going to create my own group called Baltimore Animal Control and buy those dog patrol poles with the snare at the end and wrangle niggers with it,” Higgs wrote in one post. “Also want to leave bear traps in Baltimore city with buckets of KFC chicken,” he wrote in another. Higgs also referred to Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who in 2015 massacred Black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, as “St. Roof” on the message boards. At his trial earlier this year, Higgs appeared in court in a red prison jumpsuit, his tattoo of a yellow identitarian lambda ― a white nationalist symbol ― visible on his arm. Court records show that since being found guilty in January, Higgs has also been charged with multiple misdemeanors he allegedly committed while incarcerated, including one charge of possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute. Magee, the prosecutor in the hate crime case, said these drug-related charges are still pending and did not affect the sentencing on Wednesday. Smith received a metal implant in his leg as a result of his injuries, the pain from which makes it hard to work as a concrete mason. He told HuffPost on Wednesday that he’s looking forward to taking a long vacation now that this case is behind him. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Researchers Studied A Year Of Scripted TV. Immigrant Stories Still Don't Reflect Reality.,social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Immigrant characters on mainstream TV remain disproportionately likely to be associated with crime and other negative stereotypes that don’t accurately reflect immigrant life in the U.S., a new study reveals, underscoring the importance of nuanced representation on screen. Examining 129 characters from 59 scripted shows on broadcast, cable or streaming networks that aired during the 2018-2019 TV season, the study, published Wednesday by the immigration advocacy group Define American and the University of Southern California’s Norman Lear Center, found little improvement in the stereotyping since their previous report in 2018. About half of the immigrant characters in the study were Latinx, a slight overrepresentation when compared to the U.S. population (44% of immigrants in the U.S. identify as Latinx). The researchers found that storylines involving Latinx immigrants, or even stories involving immigrants in general, have disproportionately focused on undocumented immigrants detained at the U.S.-Mexico border. Middle Eastern immigrant characters were also overrepresented — though the study notes that it was largely the result of only one show, Hulu’s “Ramy.” Researchers found some improvements from their 2018 study, such as a much lower percentage of immigrant characters depicted with accents (47%, down from 77% in 2018). About 22% of the immigrant characters were associated with crime, down from 34% in 2018 — but still disproportionately high, compared to actual crime statistics. On many levels, portrayals of immigrants on TV remain unchanged. Immigrant characters who are women, Black or Asian American or Pacific Islander (AAPI) were still underrepresented, according to the study. The level of AAPI representation actually worsened slightly: to 12% of characters, down from 16% in 2018. And when AAPI immigrants do appear on screen, they are likely to be portrayed with the “model minority” stereotype, the researchers said. TV also continues to fail in intersectional representation of immigrants. While the number of LGBTQ immigrant characters on TV was mostly consistent with the population as a whole, transgender immigrant characters were nonexistent. “Transgender migrants in particular face widespread persecution in (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) facilities, but for the second straight year, there were no transgender immigrant characters on TV,” the researchers wrote. Also, there were no undocumented Black immigrants in these shows, even though there are over 600,000 undocumented Black immigrants in the U.S. And like in many parts of the entertainment industry, disabled characters rarely, if ever, appear on these major TV shows (only about 2% of the characters in the study were depicted as having a disability). The study also underscores the importance of pop culture representation in informing and broadening people’s views. The researchers surveyed 940 TV viewers, showing them scenes from CBS’ “Madam Secretary,” NBC’s “Superstore,” and Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black,” which all have featured extensive and well-developed storylines involving immigrant characters. They found that after viewing these shows, participants were more likely to have “inclusive” and “empathetic” attitudes toward immigrants. The participants also were more likely to speak to friends about immigration issues, attend rallies and events in support of immigration, and/or contribute to charitable causes. Conversely, in stressing the importance of portraying immigrants accurately and in a representative way, the researchers warned against “heavy-handed immigration storylines that make viewers feel pressured or manipulated,” which “may backfire, particularly with more conservative or religious audiences.” The study urged the entertainment industry to take a number of steps that include “hiring more immigrants as writers and consulting with the immigrant community” when developing shows and storylines. They also called on show creators to “avoid perpetuating myths of immigrants as criminals,” focus on more underrepresented immigrant communities and develop regular or recurring immigrant characters to broaden the range of stories on screen.

2,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Will Be First Woman Ever To Lie In State At U.S. Capitol,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at 87, will be the first woman to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, allowing mourners to come pay tribute to the trailblazing feminist litigator. After civil rights legend Rosa Parks died in 2005, she lay in honor at the Capitol — a distinction given to private citizens, as opposed to government officials like Ginsburg. Ginsburg, who was the first Jewish woman on the Supreme Court, will also be the first Jewish person to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Monday that the ceremony for Ginsburg, who was the second woman to sit on the nation’s highest court, will be held Sept. 25. It will be by invitation only, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In U.S. history, only 33 people, all of them men, have lain in state at the Capitol, most of them presidents, congressmen or military leaders. Most recently, Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings (Md.) and John Lewis (Ga.), both civil rights leaders, lay in state after their deaths in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Only four civilians have lain in honor at the Capitol, including two U.S. Capitol police officers, evangelist Rev. Billy Graham and Parks. There are no rules or laws that determine who will lie in state, according to the architect of the Capitol — the distinction is determined by the House and the Senate. With the death of Ginsburg, who was one of the Supreme Court’s more liberal justices, the question of who will replace her has dramatic implications. The court is now split between three liberal justices and five conservatives. If President Donald Trump is able to get another conservative justice confirmed, that would cement conservatives’ hold on the nation’s most powerful court. Ginsburg’s last wish, dictated to her granddaughter just days before her death, was reportedly that she “not be replaced until a new president is installed.” The justice knew that the matter of her replacement will have major bearing on health care, abortion rights, civil rights and more.

3,Report: Detained Migrant Women Say They Didn’t Approve Surgeries,social-justice," HOUSTON (AP) — Sitting across from her lawyer at an immigration detention center in rural Georgia, Mileidy Cardentey Fernandez unbuttoned her jail jumpsuit to show the scars on her abdomen. There were three small, circular marks. The 39-year-old woman from Cuba was told only that she would undergo an operation to treat her ovarian cysts, but a month later, she’s still not sure what procedure she got. After Cardentey repeatedly requested her medical records to find out, Irwin County Detention Center gave her more than 100 pages showing a diagnosis of cysts but nothing from the day of the surgery. “The only thing they told me was: ‘You’re going to go to sleep and when you wake up, we will have finished,’” Cardentey said this week in a phone interview. Cardentey kept her hospital bracelet. It has the date, Aug. 14, and part of the doctor’s name, Dr. Mahendra Amin, a gynecologist linked this week to allegations of unwanted hysterectomies and other procedures done on detained immigrant women that jeopardize their ability to have children. An Associated Press review of medical records for four women and interviews with lawyers revealed growing allegations that Amin performed surgeries and other procedures on detained immigrants that they never sought or didn’t fully understand. Although some procedures could be justified based on problems documented in the records, the women’s lack of consent or knowledge raises severe legal and ethical issues, lawyers and medical experts said. Amin has performed surgery or other gynecological treatment on at least eight women detained at Irwin County Detention Center since 2017, including one hysterectomy, said Andrew Free, an immigration and civil rights lawyer working with attorneys to investigate medical treatment at the detention center. Doctors on behalf of the attorneys are examining new records and more women are coming forward to report their treatment by Amin, Free said. “The indication is there’s a systemic lack of truly informed and legally valid consent to perform procedures that could ultimately result — intentionally or unintentionally — in sterilization,” he said. The AP’s review did not find evidence of mass hysterectomies as alleged in a widely shared complaint filed by a nurse at the detention center. Dawn Wooten alleged that many detained women were taken to an unnamed gynecologist whom she labeled the “uterus collector” because of how many hysterectomies he performed. The complaint sparked a furious reaction from congressional Democrats and an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general. It also evoked comparisons to previous government-sanctioned efforts in the U.S. to sterilize people to supposedly improve society — victims who were disproportionately poor, mentally disabled, American Indian, Black, or other people of color. Thirty-three states had forced sterilization programs in the 20th century. But a lawyer who helped file the complaint said she never spoke to any women who had hysterectomies. Priyanka Bhatt, staff attorney at the advocacy group Project South, told The Washington Post that she included the hysterectomy allegations because she wanted to trigger an investigation to determine if they were true. Wooten did not answer questions at a press conference Tuesday. Project South did not respond to a request for an interview with Bhatt. The Government Accountability Project, another advocacy group involved in the complaint, declined to make Wooten available for an interview. Amin told The Intercept, which first reported Wooten’s complaint, that he has only performed one or two hysterectomies in the past three years. His attorney, Scott Grubman, said in a statement: “We look forward to all of the facts coming out, and are confident that once they do, Dr. Amin will be cleared of any wrongdoing.” Grubman did not respond to new questions Thursday. Since 2018, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it found records of two referrals for hysterectomies at the jail, which is in Ocilla, Georgia, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Atlanta. “Detainees are afforded informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee’s will,” Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps that oversees health care in detention, said in a statement. LaSalle Corrections, which operates the jail, said it “strongly refutes these allegations and any implications of misconduct.” Women housed at Irwin County Detention Center who needed a gynecologist were typically taken to Amin, according to medical records provided to the AP by Free and lawyer Alexis Ruiz, who represents Cardentey. Interviews with detainees and their lawyers suggest some women came to fear the doctor. Records reviewed by the AP show one woman was given a psychiatric evaluation the same day she refused to undergo a surgical procedure known as dilation and curettage. Commonly known as a D&C, it removes tissue from the uterus and can be used as a treatment for excessive bleeding. A note written on letterhead from Amin’s office said the woman was concerned. According to a written summary of her psychiatric evaluation, the woman said, “I am nervous about my upcoming procedure.” The summary says she denied needing mental health care and added: “I am worried because I saw someone else after they had surgery and what I saw scared me.” The AP also reviewed records for a woman who was given a hysterectomy. She reported irregular bleeding and was taken to see Amin for a D&C. A lab study of the tissue found signs of early cancer, called carcinoma. Amin’s notes indicate the woman agreed 11 days later to the hysterectomy. Free, who spoke to the woman, said she felt pressured by Amin and “didn’t have the opportunity to say no” or speak to her family before the procedure. Doctors told the AP that a hysterectomy could have been appropriate due to the carcinoma, though there may have been less intrusive options available. Lawyers for both women asked that their names be withheld for fear of retaliation by immigration authorities. In another case, Pauline Binam, a 30-year-old woman who was brought to the U.S. from Cameroon when she was 2, saw Amin after experiencing an irregular menstrual cycle and was told to have a D&C, said her attorney, Van Huynh. When she woke up from the surgery, Huynh said, she was told Amin had removed one of her two fallopian tubes, which connect the uterus to the ovaries and are necessary to conceive a child. Binam’s medical records indicate that the doctor discovered the tube was swollen. “She was shocked and sort of confronted him on that — that she hadn’t given her consent for him to proceed with that,” Huynh said. “The reply that he gave was they were in there anyway and found there was this problem.” While women can potentially still conceive with one intact tube and ovary, doctors who spoke to the AP said removal of the tube was likely unnecessary and should never have happened without Binam’s consent. The doctors also questioned how Amin discovered the swollen tube because performing a D&C would not normally involve exploring a woman’s fallopian tubes. Dr. Julie Graves, a family medicine and public health physician in Florida, called the process “absolutely abhorrent.” “It’s established U.S. law that you don’t operate on everything that you find,” she said. “If you’re in a teaching hospital and an attending physician does something like that, it’s a scandal and they are fired.” Binam was on the verge of deportation Wednesday, but ICE delayed it after calls from members of Congress and a request for an emergency stay by her lawyer. Grubman, Amin’s lawyer, said in a statement that the doctor “has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia.” Amin completed medical school in India in 1978 and his residency in gynecology in New Jersey. He has practiced in rural Georgia for at least three decades, according to court filings. State corporate records also show Amin is the executive of a company that manages Irwin County Hospital. In 2013, state and federal investigators sued Amin, the hospital authority of Irwin County and a group of other doctors over allegations they falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid. The lawsuit alleged that nurses at Irwin County Hospital were trained to follow a doctor’s “standing orders” — described as “scripted procedures based on the nurse’s diagnosis.” That meant nurses often decided treatment plans, but they were billed to Medicaid and Medicare as if they doctor did, the lawsuit said. Investigators linked a standing order to Amin, alleging he required “certain tests always be run on pregnant patients, without any medical evaluation and regardless of her condition.” The lawsuit was settled in 2015 with no known sanctions against Amin. The hospital paid a $520,000 settlement, saying no doctor paid any of it and had been “released from any and all liability.” The Georgia Medical Board lists Amin as a doctor in good standing with no public disciplinary action. Board executive director LaSharn Hughes said records of investigations were confidential under state law. State prosecutors didn’t refer Amin to the medical board after the billing lawsuit because it didn’t involve specific allegations of patient harm, said Katie Byrd, a spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. ___ Associated Press journalist Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report."
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,"Lady Gaga Speaks On Albums, Activism And America In 2020: 'All Music Is Black Music'",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A Billboard interview with Lady Gaga posted Thursday saw the superstar touching on a variety of topics, from wearing masks to making music in a year defined by COVID-19 and racial injustice in America. Gaga’s latest album, “Chromatica,” was released on May 29, the same week that police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd, sparking a wave of Black Lives Matter protests across the United States. At the time, Gaga devoted her social media feed to condemning the killing of Black Americans and specifically accused President Donald Trump of “fueling a system that is already rooted in racism and racist activity.” “When you’re born in this country, we all drink the poison that is white supremacy,” Gaga told Billboard. “I am in the process of learning and unlearning things I’ve been taught my whole life.” Many other celebrities posted similar messages after Floyd’s death; they also temporarily silenced their social media feeds with black squares in an effort to center public awareness on the fight for social justice. “Social justice is not just a literacy, it’s a lifestyle,” Gaga told Billboard and suggested she understood the resulting accusations of performative activism. “What do I think about [posting] a black square?” Gaga asked. “I think everybody has a different feeling about a black square. Do I think there’s such a thing as performative activism? Yes. Do I think there’s been true activism that’s been very important and needed? Yes. Do I believe Black lives matter? Yes. Do I believe this is going to get louder? Yes. Do I believe it should? Yes.” Gaga said that she hoped to pay homage to more people of color who pioneered the house sound featured on her latest albums, pointing to a recent remix of “Free Woman” from her “Chromatica” album by Black music producer and transgender activist Honey Dijon. “All music is Black music,” the star said. “That’s just a fact.” The interview also covered Gaga’s activities during the coronavirus lockdown. In April, the singer and her team coordinated a virtual “One World: Together at Home” concert with the likes of Lizzo, John Legend and Billie Eilish, which raised $35 million for the World Health Organization. In August, Gaga encouraged fans to wear masks at the MTV Video Music Awards by sporting a number of colorful outfits with outlandish face coverings. “It’s really wrong for us to go, ‘I’m uncomfortable [with wearing a mask] because I can’t breathe,’” Gaga told Billboard, addressing anti-mask sentiment in the U.S. “Give me a break. Show some respect for the people who are there for us when we dial 911.” Read the full interview here. Reporter, HuffPost"
11,What It’s Like To Be Held By ICE During The COVID-19 Pandemic,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A few weeks into his time in immigrant detention, 35-year-old Antony was diagnosed with the flu. He was born with sickle cell anemia and is immunocompromised, so with COVID-19 spreading throughout the U.S., he was terrified. If he contracted the coronavirus, it could kill him. “I was praying a lot,” said Antony, who spoke to HuffPost through an interpreter and is being referred to by a pseudonym to avoid retaliation. “I was telling God to give me the strength and the courage to deal with this situation.” Antony is one of the thousands of immigrants who have been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke to HuffPost about his experience in a detention center in New Jersey, one of the facilities that are vulnerable due to the use of common spaces, a lack of room for social distancing, a lack of proper medical attention and guards who might bring the virus in or carry it out. (See the video above on Antony’s experience.) Although ICE officials say the agency is taking precautions to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, including releasing more than 1,000 people, activists say that the facilities remain ill-prepared to protect those detained. Immigrants were given face masks only recently, but most of them are forced to reuse single-use masks without being allowed to wash them or receive new ones. Those held were not given soap or sanitizers and some were even exposed to pesticides and other toxic substances. Despite global lockdown measures, ICE continued to detain, transfer and deport immigrants ― including thousands of children ― all of which has contributed to the spread of the coronavirus nationally and globally. Foreign governments who accepted deportees said they brought the coronavirus back with them. Antony ultimately tested negative for COVID-19 and was released to be with his family as he awaits court proceedings. But others in the facility did test positive. At least one immigrant tested positive for COVID-19 at the same facility in March. All told, more than 5,000 individuals have contracted the virus while in ICE custody, including more than 800 ICE detainees just in the last week. In Arizona, more than 200 new cases were reported at one of ICE’s facilities. ICE facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Virginia have all reported deaths as a result of COVID-19. Last month, a 50-year-old Honduran man held at a Texas immigration facility died after testing positive for COVID-19. He was the 19th detainee to die while in ICE custody during the 2020 fiscal year. This year likely will mark the highest number of immigrant deaths while in ICE custody. In 2006, 19 immigrants also died while in custody, which is the highest number of deaths to date. “The government is endangering people who are in its custody and doing so in a way that the people are not able to protect themselves,” said Karlyn Kurichety, a supervisory attorney at Al Otro Lado, a social justice legal services organization. “One death is too many because this is something preventable. This is a government-created situation. We just see the numbers keep increasing, and nothing is being done,” she added. A spokesperson for ICE said the agency has taken on “proactive measures include limiting the intake of new detainees, implementing alternative detention programs, social distancing, cohorting, and monitoring and screening detainees for COVID-19,” as well as providing detainees with the “appropriate personal protective equipment.” “The safety, health, and well-being of its detained population are among U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s top priorities. This is made evident by the more than $269 million the agency spends annually on the spectrum of health care services provided to detainees in ICE custody,” the ICE spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement. On a cold January morning, Antony, who was born in the Caribbean, kissed his wife and baby goodbye as he left for work on the East Coast. It was 5 a.m., and he hadn’t slept much the night before. His son, less than a year old, was sick, and both parents had been up all night taking care of him. But Antony had to leave for work to provide for his family. He was in his car when an unmarked van blocked his way. The men from the van identified themselves as police and told him he was under arrest. They took him to an immigration facility in New Jersey, where he stayed with about 60 other detainees. “When you’re far away from your family, far away from someone you love and someone who loves you, and they take that away, they tear it away from you just like that, it destroys you. It destroys your heart,” Antony told HuffPost through an interpreter. By February, lawyers at the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit based in New York City, took on Antony’s case advocating for his release. “ICE has endangered the lives of our clients and others in their jails by making the indefensible choice to detain them during this pandemic,” said Katherine Kim, supervising attorney in the immigration law unit at the Legal Aid Society. “They have a clear track record of failing to provide adequate and appropriate medical care to people in detention, and we continue to be concerned for the health and well-being of our clients.” Although ICE officials announced an increase in COVID-19 testing, advocates said it was not sufficient as long as people were constantly exposed and left unprotected. Earlier this year, federal judges ordered the release of immigrants who were at higher risk, such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions. “COVID-19 has revealed the fatal flaws and the negligent medical care that ICE has historically provided to people who are detained within its facilities,” said Denise Bell, a researcher at Amnesty International USA. “What’s more disturbing is the carelessness, and I’d even say callousness, with which the government is treating people in its care and custody.” Advocates say ICE’s lack of transparency has left them unable to assess the true cost of outbreaks and if the death toll and transmission rate could be higher. Immigrants inside the facilities said they were not being told the latest information about the pandemic or how to best protect themselves, causing mass panic among the detainees. Rebekah Entralgo, the spokesperson for Freedom for Immigrants, an advocacy nonprofit that monitors human rights abuses faced by immigrants detained by ICE, told HuffPost that its hotline continues to receive calls from those inside the facility for the latest news. They have to rely on friends, families or advocates to provide updated information from public health officials or the government. “What we see is a consistent pattern of obfuscation. [ICE] is not transparent about how many people have been tested. They are not transparent about how many people actually have contracted. They give numbers, and you’re not quite sure if they’re people who are facility staff or if they are people who have been detained,” Bell said. Immigrants have told advocates that officials inside the facilities have often turned off the TV and taken away newspapers to block information about the pandemic. Detainees who don’t speak English or Spanish are often among the last to find out information from ICE. “This is not a time for punishment or making somebody out to be the other evil because of where they come from or because they want to seek safety here. This is about keeping us all safe,” Bell said. As for Antony, he’s grateful to be home with his wife and children. He doesn’t know what the future holds for him as an undocumented person because his case is ongoing, but for now he plans to keep working and providing for his family. “Freedom is priceless… . When they take away that freedom, you get destroyed,” he said. “I’m here again with my family, free and trying to do everything possible to push ahead.

12,House Democrats Demand Investigation Into Claims Of Excessive Hysterectomies On ICE Detainees,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost At least 173 members of the House on Wednesday demanded an immediate investigation into a whistleblower’s allegation that a doctor she called the “uterus collector” performed an alarming number of hysterectomies on immigrant women detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general Joseph Cuffari, the lawmakers also called for an urgent response and a briefing by Sept. 25 on the status of an investigation into the privately run Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Ocilla, Georgia. “We are horrified to see reports of mass hysterectomies performed on detained women in the facility without their full-informed consent and request. Everyone ― regardless of their immigration status, their language, or their incarceration ― deserves to control their own reproductive choices and make informed choices about their bodies,” wrote the lawmakers led by Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Judy Chu (D-Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). “We request that your office immediately open an investigation to thoroughly examine allegations raised.” I co-led 173 members of Congress in demanding that DHS' Inspector General immediately open a full investigation into horrifying whistleblower allegations of mass hysterectomies being performed on immigrant women by a doctor called, ""the uterus collector."" There can be no delay. pic.twitter.com/gcIqp8zbhq The letter did not include House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), though the Democratic leader separately called for the inspector general to investigate the “appalling” allegations at ICDC. The inspector general’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Several legal advocacy groups filed a complaint dated Monday on behalf of whistleblower Dawn Wooten, a nurse with a decade of experience who worked full time at the facility until July. The complaint alleges that officials have created unsanitary conditions and allowed for “jarring medical neglect” at the ICDC, which is operated by private prison company LaSalle Corrections. In addition to the alleged excessive hysterectomies, the center is accused of not taking basic precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and repeatedly ignoring detained immigrants’ medical needs. Wooten said Tuesday she had to publicly speak out after witnessing “inhumane” treatment of immigrants. According to the nurse, detained women are regularly sent to a gynecologist off-site who will sometimes remove all or part of their uteruses. The complaint also documented other accounts by anonymous immigrant women who reported their concerns about the hysterectomies to Project South, a human rights group that helped file the complaint. One woman called the situation an “experimental concentration camp,” and another reported knowing five women who had hysterectomies within a three-month period. “Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy ― just about everybody,” Wooten alleged in the complaint. “He’s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady [detained immigrant woman].” Many of the women may not understand that they’re consenting to the procedure due to language barriers, she alleged, adding that several migrants have told her “they’ve been to see the doctor and they don’t know why they went or why they’re going.” Dawn Wooten, the nurse who blew the whistle on ICE, just went on MSNBC. This is being done in our name. pic.twitter.com/ljacMzUQ0N On Tuesday evening, Wooten told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes that one detained woman came up to her and asked, “What is he? Is he the uterus collector? Does he collect uteruses?” When Wooten allegedly asked her to clarify, the detainee said, “Everybody that I’ve talked to has had a hysterectomy.” “You just don’t know what to say,” the nurse told Hayes. ICE told HuffPost on Tuesday that it does not comment on matters related to the inspector general, but that the agency “takes all allegations seriously.” The House Homeland Security Committee said it will be looking into the new allegations as part of its ongoing investigation into conditions at ICE detention centers. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform demanded an “emergency investigation” into the allegations on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, this is not the first time that serious concerns have been raised about this facility,” wrote Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Civil Rights Subcommittee Chairman Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) in a letter to the inspector general. The oversight chairs attached a previous letter they sent to the inspector general in November 2019, urging “a thorough review by your office” of ICDC and other ICE facilities in Georgia based on health and safety issues that staff on the oversight committee observed. The letter on Tuesday requests an immediate briefing on what actions the inspector general has taken in response to the 2019 letter. “As you know, our Committee staff conducted a site visit at this facility in September 2019, during which they observed alarmingly urgent health and safety issues,” the chairs wrote on Tuesday. “In fact, Committee staff were so disturbed that they raised concerns directly with the ICDC warden during the visit.” The U.S. has a long history of performing forced medical operations on marginalized groups as a way to fuel white supremacy. Up to 70,000 Americans, most of whom were women, were forcibly sterilized from the early 1900s to the 1970s, a time in which 32 states had eugenic-sterilization laws. The victims were deemed unfit to birth children because of eugenics ― the idea that people who are non-white, poor, mentally ill or disabled must be bred out of future generations. “This practice continued for incarcerated individuals into recent times, as nearly 150 incarcerated women in California prisons were sterilized between 2006 and 2010. In Georgia alone, 3,284 individuals had been sterilized by the end of 1963, as the state was responsible for the fifth highest number of sterilizations in the country,” the House members’ letter stated. “This shameful history of sterilization in the United States, in particular sterilization of people of color and incarcerated people, must never be repeated. Yet, the similarities to the accounts of immigrant women and nurses in the Irwin County Detention Center today are eerily similar.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Whistleblower Says Excessive Hysterectomies Are Being Done On ICE Detainees,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Several people, including a nurse, expressed alarm at the number of hysterectomies being performed on immigrant women at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Ocilla, Georgia, according to a new whistleblower complaint sent to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General. Multiple legal advocacy groups filed the complaint, dated Monday, on behalf of Dawn Wooten, a licensed practical nurse with a decade of experience. The complaint alleges that officials have fostered unsanitary conditions and allowed for “jarring medical neglect” at the Irwin County Detention Center, which is operated by the private prison company LaSalle Corrections. In addition to the allegedly high number of hysterectomies performed on female detainees, the center is accused of failing to take basic steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Wooten said in a press conference Tuesday that she had to speak out publicly after witnessing the “inhumane” treatment of immigrants. ICE told HuffPost that it “does not comment on matters presented to the Office of the Inspector General, which provides independent oversight and accountability within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” The agency continued: “ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the OIG regarding any potential investigation and/or results. That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.” HuffPost did not immediately receive a response from LaSalle Corrections. According to the nurse, female detainees are regularly sent to an off-site doctor who sometimes ends up removing all or part of their uteruses. Due to language barriers, many of the women may not be able to properly consent to the procedure. Some nurses end up “simply googling Spanish” to obtain patient consent, she alleged. “That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector,” Wooten said of the doctor, who is not named in the public version of the complaint. “I’ve had several inmates tell me that they’ve been to see the doctor and they’ve had hysterectomies and they don’t know why they went or why they’re going,” she said. Although the women are told that they have severe menstruation issues requiring the procedure, Wooten doubts that is really the case, saying, “everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.” “Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy ― just about everybody. He’s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady [detained immigrant woman],” Wooten said in the complaint. The patient was supposed to have her left ovary removed due to a cyst, but the doctor allegedly took out her right ovary. “She was upset,” Wooten said. “She had to go back to take out the left and she wound up with a total hysterectomy. She still wanted children ― so she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can’t bear kids.” Wooten’s statements were bolstered by other, anonymous accounts given to Project South, a human rights group that helped file the complaint. “Several immigrant women have reported to Project South their concerns about how many women have received a hysterectomy while detained at ICDC,” the complaint read. For attempting to voice her concerns about ICDC ― including that rooms and equipment were not properly cleaned and that medical records were being fabricated ― Wooten says in the complaint that she was demoted and issued a reprimand. Since the coronavirus crisis began, employees have struggled to obtain sufficient personal protective equipment, according to the complaint, which notes that social distancing is not observed at the facility. Employees are also allegedly made to work even while presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Wooten says she was personally written up for not reporting to work while experiencing symptoms and that she was not permitted to tell her co-workers which detainees had tested positive. “Interviews with another current member of Irwin’s medical staff ― who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation ― and four people currently or recently detained there” have backed up Wooten’s accusations, according to a report by The Intercept. The outlet did not mention the allegedly excessive hysterectomies. America’s prisons and jails have faced harsh criticism for allowing coronavirus infection and death rates to spike in the cramped facilities. “Ms. Wooten’s whistleblowing disclosures reveal not only gross mismanagement from LaSalle leadership, but actions that deliberately put the health of detainees, workers, and the public at risk,” said attorney John Whitty of the Government Accountability Project, which also helped file the complaint. “It is up to DHS to heed the warnings of employee whistleblowers like Ms. Wooten and take action to enforce protective measures against the rampant spread of COVID-19.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Trump Seems To Endorse Extrajudicial Killing: 'There Has To Be Retribution',social-justice," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost President Donald Trump appeared to support law enforcement officers who take criminal justice into their own hands after U.S. marshals killed a man suspected in a fatal shooting in Oregon last month. “There has to be retribution when you have a crime like that,” Trump said. Trump’s apparent endorsement of extrajudicial killing came after members of a fugitive task force shot and killed Michael Forest Reinoehl, 39, a self-described anti-fascist, on Sept. 3. Reinoehl was wanted on suspicion of fatally shooting a member of a far-right group in Portland, Oregon, on Aug. 29. “This guy was a violent criminal, and the U.S. marshals killed him, and I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be,” Trump told Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro, a former New York state judge, in an interview that aired Saturday. President endorsing straight up extra-judicial killing. https://t.co/no1WFA3qlx Trump also appeared to suggest that law enforcement officers take similar action against demonstrators suspected of committing violent acts. He made his comments as protesters across the country demonstrate against racism and police brutality amid the police killings of Black Americans. “You can’t throw bricks at guys with shields on them,” he said. Reinoehl’s shooting death came the same day that Trump took to Twitter to call for Reinoehl’s arrest, calling him a “cold blooded killer.” Authorities said that Reinoehl was armed and resisted arrest at the time he was shot to death. An investigation into the shooting continues. One witness told The Washington Post that he never saw Reinoehl pull out a gun. Nate Dinguss said he saw officers pull up to Reinoehl in two unmarked police vehicles, get out without identifying themselves and immediately start firing their weapons at him. But two other witnesses told The Olympian that they saw Reinoehl fire what they thought was an assault rifle at the unmarked SUVs after the vehicles pulled up to him. A Thurston County Sheriff’s Office investigation has not yet determined whether Reinoehl fired, brandished or displayed a semiautomatic handgun that was reportedly found with him. If Reinoehl threatened officers or posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to them, they would not need a reason to warn him before opening fire. The American criminal justice system presumes that a suspect is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Taking punitive action against a suspect before then would run counter to that system. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the state from depriving any person of life without due process of law. It also prohibits the state from denying “any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Facebook Engineer Pens Letter Saying Company Is 'On The Wrong Side of History',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost A Facebook software engineer named Ashok Chandwaney publicly quit on Tuesday morning after posting a lengthy letter to the company’s intranet, claiming that Facebook was “profiting off hate in the US and globally.” “It is clear to me that despite the best efforts of many of us who work here ... Facebook is choosing to be on the wrong side of history,” Chandwaney wrote, arguing that Facebook was failing to embody its much-touted five core values — be bold, focus on impact, move fast, be open and build social value. Chandwaney went on to list multiple examples of negligence when it came to Facebook policing extremist activity and disinformation. These included international examples of widespread hate speech against the Rohingya people in Myanmar as well as instances in the U.S., such as Facebook’s inaction regarding militia groups plotting violence in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and its unwillingness to remove a controversial post by President Donald Trump warning protesters that a violent intervention might be necessary. “Every day ‘the looting starts, the shooting starts’ stays up is a day that we choose to minimize regulatory risk at the expense of the safety of Black, Indigenous, and people of color,” Chandwaney wrote, referencing the inflammatory language that Trump used in that post. “Violent hate groups and far-right militias are out there, and they’re using Facebook to recruit and radicalize people who will go on to commit violent hate crimes. So where’s the metric about this?” Chandwaney said that despite the recommendations of multiple civil rights organizers and a July internal audit, which now seemed like little more than a “PR deflection strategy,” Facebook had remained resistant to change. “What I wish I saw were a serious prioritization of social good even when there isn’t an immediately obvious business value to it, or when there may be business harm that comes from it - for instance, removing the sitting president’s incitement to violence, which could lead to regulatory action,” Chandwaney wrote. “It seems that Facebook hasn’t found the business value to be had in aggressively pursuing the existing credible strategies to remove hate from the platform - despite pressure from civil society.” In a statement sent to The Washington Post, Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois rejected Chandwaney’s claims, arguing that the social media giant was not profiting from hate. “We invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and are in deep partnership with outside experts to review and update our policies,” she said. “This summer we launched an industry leading policy to go after QAnon, grew our fact-checking program, and removed millions of posts tied to hate organizations — over 96% of which we found before anyone reported them to us.” The same day that Chandwaney’s letter went public, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied that the social platform is a “right-wing echo chamber” and pledged that Facebook would work to limit misinformation about any eventual COVID-19 vaccine. Zuckerberg added that with the November elections looming, his team would also “very aggressively take down any threats against those people who are going to be involved in doing the counting and making sure that the election goes the way it’s supposed to.” Read the entire resignation letter here, courtesy of The Washington Post.

0,'Violent Trump' Ad Ties The President To U.S. Hate Explosion,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A blistering new political ad attacks President Donald Trump as the stoker in chief of racist violence in America. The ad, by the Really American anti-Trump PAC, underscores national surges in hate crimes against Blacks, Muslims and Jews. And it juxtaposes the worsening situation in America with a mashup of Trump’s disparaging remarks about immigrants and calls to violence against his detractors, including: “Knock the crap out of ’em.” The ad concludes with a self-own by Trump when he bashed Barack Obama in 2016 in his Republican National Convention speech: “The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly I have ever seen.” The ad concludes: “End the nightmare.” Really American is currently targeting its ads in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Its first 28 attack videos since mid-June garnered 60 million views, according to the PAC. Check the latest ad above.

1,William Barr Says Police Being Racist Toward Black People Isn't Racism,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Attorney General William Barr stunned viewers Wednesday when he said that it’s not necessarily racism when police repeatedly treat Black people differently than white people. Barr made the remarks in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, who pressed him to back up his stated belief that Black people aren’t disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. “I think there are some situations where statistics would suggest that they are treated differently, but I don’t think that that’s necessarily racism,” Barr said. The attorney general also disputed the idea that the criminal justice system treats Black people more harshly, as research broadly shows it does. “No, I don’t think there are two justice systems,” he said. “I think the narrative that the police are on some epidemic of shooting unarmed Black men is simply a false narrative, and also the narrative that that’s based on race.” Wolf confronted Barr with a remark he’d made to ABC in July, quoting him as saying, “I do think it is a widespread phenomenon that African American males, in particular, are treated with extra suspicion and maybe not given the benefit of the doubt.” “That’s what I just said,” Barr responded. Perplexed, Wolf asked, “But doesn’t that sound like systemic racism?” Barr began nitpicking the language: “No. To me, the word systemic means that it’s built into the institution.” What the attorney general acknowledged to be true is, in fact, systemic racism. Racism against Black people has been built into the American system since white settlers colonized the land and then spent centuries enslaving Black people and legalizing discrimination against them. The lingering effects of those practices are what fuel the racism Black Americans face today, sometimes directly costing them their lives. President Donald Trump, too, said this week that police violence against Black people isn’t a systemic issue. “I don’t believe that,” he said. “I think the police do an incredible job, and I think you do have some bad apples.” Trump was speaking at a roundtable event in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where police recently shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, in the back seven times, paralyzing him from the waist down. Barr claimed during his CNN interview that Blake was “in the midst of committing a felony and he was armed.” Wolf corrected him, noting that Blake’s family and lawyers say that a knife might have been nearby but that Blake wasn’t armed with it. Barr stood by his claim about the case, which remains under investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice and the FBI.

2,Young People At The March On Washington Pledge To Keep Fighting,social-justice," Senior Front Page Editor, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Despite the sweltering heat and the ever-present threat of the coronavirus pandemic, thousands of demonstrators converged Friday on the National Mall to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. And like the march in 1963, many young, hopeful faces could be seen throughout the crowd, intent on continuing the fight for civil rights and social justice. The original March on Washington, which cumulated in Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, called for racial equality, civil rights and economic justice. Friday’s march makes the same demands. But this generation believes that this time is different. “People in my generation, we’re not allowing this anymore,” Bria Thomas, 27, said. “We’re really taking a stand on this. That’s why I wanted to be a part of this today. It’s people of color, it’s people my age, that are really fighting to make a change.” Bria’s cousin, Micah Thomas, flew to the District of Columbia from Illinois with her mother to attend the march. At 17, she’s a member of Gen Z, an increasingly progressive generation. The march “gives me more of an idea of how I want to change the world,” said Micah, who serves as president of the youth chapter of the NAACP in Kankakee County. People traveled from all over the United States to participate and continue the protests against police violence and racism during a summer that saw an open embrace of white supremacy and the recent violent deaths of three Black people: Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. The shooting Sunday of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, only strengthened demonstrators’ resolve. Yolanda Renee King, the 12-year-old granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr., took the same steps he took 57 years ago and told the crowd of thousands that her generation would be the one to fulfill her grandfather’s dream. “My generation has already taken to the streets peacefully with masks — and socially distanced — to protest racism,” she said. “And I want to ask the young people here to join me in pledging that we have only just begun to fight and that we will be the generation that moves from ‘me to we.’” This is how many people showed up to the #MarchOnWashington today. pic.twitter.com/l0qPtWn25Y Older civil rights leaders are excited to see younger generations pick up the mantle. “We are commemorating 1963 because 2020 has become perhaps the most consequential year since 1963 or 1968 when it comes to American civil rights and social justice issues,” Marc Morial, the president and CEO of the National Urban League, told HuffPost. “I’m excited to see the younger generation of activists.” Morial attended the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington while he was in his 20s. The night before the march, hundreds of young activists and protesters gathered outside of the White House for a demonstration that sought to drown out President Donald Trump’s Republican nomination acceptance speech Thursday evening. Seun Babalola is one of the founders of Concerned Citizens D.C., a group of organizers that wants to bring structure and demands to the protests in the nation’s capital. “Young people have been at the forefront of the movement since the ’60s,” he said. But though he respects the lineage of protesters before him, he didn’t expect the march to “push the envelope.” The march won’t have anything “pushing the envelope too far left; it won’t be anything like you see out here. And that is by design,” Babalola, 23, said. “That is due to the fact that there are certain things you cannot say if you are within that political machine, within that Democratic establishment. That’s what it is.” Senior Front Page Editor, HuffPost"
3,"NBA Pledges To Turn Arenas Into Voting Sites, Announces Resumption Of Playoff Games",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Capping off what’s already been a historic week for the NBA, the league’s commissioner and the National Basketball Players Association issued a joint statement Friday announcing the resumption of the NBA playoffs, as well as plans to promote voting access and address issues around racial injustice. The plans include transforming NBA arenas into voting sites for the November general election. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts said in the statement that playoff games would resume on Saturday — days after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to play in a Wednesday game against the Orlando Magic in reaction to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other NBA teams involved in the playoffs promptly chose to follow in the Bucks’ footsteps, pledging boycotts of their own. Athletes in other leagues soon also followed suit. Joint NBA and NBPA statement: pic.twitter.com/EFp6fG9oZs Silver and Roberts said the boycotts had prompted a “candid, impassioned and productive conversation” between the league and teams “regarding next steps to further our collective efforts and actions in support of social justice and racial equality.” The next steps ultimately agreed upon include establishing a social justice coalition involving players, coaches and team governors; and airing ads during NBA playoff games that raise awareness around voter access. The NBA also pledged to convert arenas into voting locations for the November general election. “In every city where the league franchise owns and controls the arena property, team governors will continue to work with local elections officials to convert the facility into a voting location for the 2020 general election to allow for a safe in-person voting option for communities vulnerable to COVID,” the statement said. “If a deadline has passed, team governors will work with local elections officials to find another election-related use for the facility, including but not limited to voter registration and ballot receiving boards.” As SB Nation noted, there are 29 NBA venues. It’s unclear, however, how many would be involved in the voting initiative. Several NBA teams had already offered to turn their arenas into voting sites, including the Bucks, Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons and Sacramento Kings. With their vast size — and potential for better social distancing — sports venues have been touted as particularly useful voting spaces during the pandemic. Silver and Roberts said Friday that the new commitments “follow months of close collaboration around designing a safe and healthy environment to restart the NBA season, providing a platform to promote social justice, as well as creating an NBA Foundation focused on economic empowerment in the Black community,” referring to a charity established by the league earlier this month. “We look forward to the resumption of the playoffs and continuing to work together … to push for meaningful and sustainable change,” they added.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,U.S. Detaining More Migrant Children In Hotels Despite Outcry,social-justice," HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration has sharply increased its use of hotels to detain immigrant children as young as 1 before expelling them from the United States during the coronavirus pandemic despite facing outcry from lawmakers and human-rights advocates. Federal authorities said they detained 577 unaccompanied children in hotels through the end of July, up from 240 in April, May and June, according to a report published late Wednesday from a court-appointed monitor for detained immigrant youth. The Associated Press reported on the practice last month, with the Trump administration citing the threat of the virus in rapidly expelling those children and other migrants under an emergency declaration that denies them a chance to seek asylum. Keeping kids in hotels circumvents federal anti-trafficking laws and a two-decade-old court settlement, and advocates have warned of potential mistreatment. Meanwhile, new allegations have emerged of efforts at the hotels to skirt health precautions. An immigrant from Haiti says government contractors at a hotel where he was detained gave his family, including his 1-year-old daughter, cups of ice to eat to pass temperature checks before their deportation flight, though they had tested negative for COVID-19. “We were given them with only one instruction, to eat them to lower our temperature,” Verty told the AP last week. He’s being identified only by his last name because he fears retribution if he tries to come to the U.S. again. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement guidelines say no detainee with a temperature above 99 degrees (37 degrees Celsius) can board a deportation flight — a way to protect against the spread of COVID-19, which often causes a fever. In a statement, the agency said it “does not seek to alter an individual’s temperature through artificial cooling measures.” The Trump administration has defended expelling more than 100,000 adults and children, saying the practice is necessary to protect border agents and stop the virus from spreading. It has effectively shut down the asylum system during the pandemic, which opponents of President Donald Trump say is being used as a pretext to implement long-sought restrictions on immigration. Most children who cross the border without permission are supposed to go to Health and Human Services shelters that are licensed by states, offer schooling and legal services, and eventually place children with family sponsors. Instead, the Trump administration is holding children in hotels or Border Patrol facilities for days, sometimes weeks, before expelling them. At least 2,000 children who came to the U.S. without a parent have been sent back to their home countries, though officials haven’t updated the total since late June. Immigration authorities say “transportation specialists” from the private contractor MVM Inc. care for children in hotels. ICE has described them as “non-law enforcement staff members trained to work with minors and to ensure that all aspects of the transport or stay are compliant.” The agency declined to say whether they undergo FBI background checks. The federal government compiled the new data as part of the Flores settlement agreement that governs the treatment of immigrant children in custody. The report says children are being housed in more than 25 hotels, up from three last month. In court filings, the Trump administration says children in hotels are given medical care and temperature checks every four hours. Surfaces are sanitized and meals from local restaurants are served three times a day, plus snacks, the government says. As first reported by ProPublica, the government says it expels children detained in hotels only after they test negative for COVID-19. The AP interviewed two fathers from Haiti who were detained with their wives and infant children in July at the Hampton Inn & Suites in McAllen, Texas. In addition to Verty, the AP is identifying the second father, Paul, only by his first name because he has a pending immigration case in the U.S. Both said the hotel had good meals, showers and comfortable beds, unlike a border detention center where they were first held separately from their families and unable to shower for days. Their temperatures were checked throughout the day at the hotel, where many people appeared to be Haitian, they said. But they weren’t allowed to leave their rooms. The telephones were removed, and to call relatives, they had to ask the contractors supervising them. Paul said a contractor stayed in his room at all hours, insisting that the family keep the bathroom door open anytime they went inside. Paul and his wife tested positive at the hotel for COVID-19, while Verty and his wife tested negative. Verty says contractors repeatedly told them they were taking a flight to Florida to live with relatives and encouraged them to eat ice in case their temperatures were checked. “I understood it was a deportation when I saw people arriving in handcuffs,” he said. After the AP reported in July that three Hampton Inns had been used to detain children, advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers criticized the administration, with U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania tweeting, “This is child abuse.” The American Civil Liberties Union also sued on behalf of people detained at the McAllen hotel. The U.S. government agreed not to expel 17 parents and children who were at the hotel on July 23, and Paul’s family was eventually released in the U.S. “We have now filed a class action to stop the policy wholesale, because the government’s policy of holding the children in secret in hotels and quickly expelling them made it impossible to find and represent each child individually,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said. Both Paul and Verty had fled Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, in 2016 and settled in Chile. They decided in November 2019 to try to enter the U.S. It took the families six months to traverse South and Central America, crossing often-deadly jungles and migration routes, before they arrived in July. Advocates for Haitian immigrants say they face special mistreatment, with higher bonds and less likelihood of winning asylum. “Racism, discrimination, and anti-Blackness is rooted in every system, including the immigration system,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance. While Paul and his family are in the U.S., his friend Verty is back in Haiti, facing irregular electricity and access to food. “We always talked about our plans together, how we were going to work hard for our families,” Paul said. “I still have faith that he’ll make it here some day. I don’t know how.” ___ Sanon reported from Port-au-Prince, Haiti."
11,Trump Pulls Political Stunts At The RNC,social-justice, Microbio
12,Trump Courts Minorities With Convention Stunts Despite Long History Of Stoking Racism,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost President Donald Trump’s surprise pardon of a Black man and his staging of a naturalization ceremony as the Republican National Convention kicked off its second night on Tuesday was aimed at bolstering his image as someone who isn’t hostile to people of color. But the narrative spun at the GOP convention this week of an inclusive president ― beginning with testimonials from prominent African American politicians and athletes who spoke Monday ― is sharply contradicted by Trump’s long history of stoking racism and his attempts to scare white people about Black “mobs” and crime. The man pardoned Tuesday, Jon Ponder, was convicted of robbing a bank in Nevada and now runs a nonprofit helping released prisoners reenter society. His story is a compelling one, and there’s nothing necessarily controversial about his receiving a pardon. But Trump’s decision to use the powers of his office at a political event for expressly political purposes was a first in convention history, eliciting accusations of ethical violations and abuse of power. “This is way beyond ‘norm-breaking,’” Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a progressive advocacy group, said in a statement. “Trump is hijacking the government that belongs to ‘We the People’ to further his own personal ends. He is sabotaging and threatening the very existence of our constitutional democracy. For Trump fans who might brush this off, just imagine your reaction if Obama had done something comparable.” Legality aside, Trump’s record on race relations is fraught with racist appeals to his mostly white base, rhetoric that has gotten sharper as the November election approaches. He has pushed to preserve Confederate symbols, denounced the Black Lives Matter movement, directed scare tactics toward suburban communities about affordable housing, retweeted a video of a supporter saying “white power,” declared that the torch-wielding marchers chanting racist and anti-Semitic slurs in Charlottesville, Virginia, included “very fine people,” and promoted the racist “birther” conspiracy theory about former President Barack Obama, to name just a few of his ploys. Though he signed a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill into law, his administration is about to set a modern record for executing federal prisoners, carrying out two just this week. His Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile, is moving to roll back Obama-era efforts to prod local governments into building more low-income housing in higher-income areas. HUD Secretary Ben Carson warned in an op-ed this month about the “the Obama-Biden dystopian vision of building low-income housing units next to your suburban house.” The airing of a naturalization ceremony at Tuesday’s convention and its intended message to the American people that their president welcomes immigrants is similarly undercut by Trump’s zeal for making it harder for people to enter the country ― legally or not. “You follow the rules, you obey the laws, you learned our history, embraced our values and proved yourselves to be men and women of the highest integrity,” Trump told five new citizens during the ceremony, which was also held at the White House. “It’s not so easy. You’ve been through a lot.” Trump’s administration has actually raised the barriers to legal immigration ― nearly doubling the fees for a number of immigration and work authorization applications, including the fee to apply for naturalization. Trump has shut down nearly all refugee resettlement, redirected funds for military projects to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, barred travel to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority countries, tried to repeal protections for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, and, perhaps most consequentially, adopted a “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting migrants, which has resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents, a policy that has caused incalculable trauma.

13,Are Looters Undermining The Movement — Or Creating It?,social-justice," Books and Culture Writer, HuffPost Windows smashed and vehicles set ablaze; government building doors shattered; cops blanketing protesters in tear gas: Kenosha, Wisconsin, has become the latest battleground between police and protesters resisting state violence toward Black people. The uprising broke out after police shot 29-year-old Jacob Blake seven times in the back, in front of three of his children, on Sunday night. This summer’s wave of protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer had barely gotten underway when the condemnation started. As police precincts burned and protesters smashed store windows, the public conversation quickly turned away from the horror of anti-Black violence toward the horror of property destruction. On the right, of course, invocations of law and order were swift. But pundits and politicians on the left, while unwilling to openly critique Black Lives Matter protests, concern-trolled about white anarchists and outside agitators undermining the movement with their reckless violence. For Vicky Osterweil, author of the new book “In Defense of Looting: A Riotous History of Uncivil Action,” the sentiment was deeply predictable. Riots and property damage, she argues, are often erased from the accepted history of protest movements, including the 1960s civil rights movement, while nonviolence is held up as both more effective and more righteous. This year has been no exception. In a conversation with HuffPost in July, Osterweil pointed out that the standard line of criticism has continued despite popular sympathy with rioters. According to one poll released in June, the burning of Minneapolis’ 3rd precinct was considered at least partially justified by a majority of Americans. “If those riots hadn’t spread to every major city and many smaller ones across the country, would there be this much constant activity, these protests which give the people who critique looting the opportunity to say, ‘It’s not the point of the movement’?” Osterweil said. “In Defense of Looting” was born out of the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and 2015. “This book only exists because the rebels in Ferguson showed us all the way,” Osterweil told HuffPost. She observed the uprising in the streets, and the media narrative that quickly arose — the condemnations of property damage, the tsk-tsking about how scenes of looting would surely turn the public against those protesting in defense of Black lives — and wrote a stirring rebuttal in the New Inquiry. Looting, she argued, has been “one of the most righteous anti-white supremacist tactics available” in America. Her argument reaches back to the foundations of the country, and the establishment of slavery as a system under which white people held property and Black people were property, and could find freedom by “stealing” themselves. It extends to the recent past, examining the necessity of riots and looting to Black civil rights movements in the 1960s and the 2010s. “The last few months of movement have exceeded any possible imagination of mine, frankly,” she said. “We’re living through a truly unprecedented and historic social movement right now.” In her conversation with HuffPost, Osterweil discussed the downsides of fixating on organizing and nonviolent tactics, why white supremacy and property are inextricably linked, and the problem with abstract conversations about civility. Your book really could not be more directly speaking to the moment, in a lot of ways, especially because there ended up being ― as there often is during these waves of protests — a lot of discourse about looting and whether it’s effective, whether protest should be nonviolent, is looting a distraction from the point of the protests. How have we seen looting and sort of non-nonviolent tactics playing a role in what’s going on with these Black Lives Matter protests? I think the thing that happens a lot when people start talking about nonviolent tactics being the only right way is that they immediately begin erasing the very, very recent history of a movement. If it wasn’t for three days of rioting and looting in Minneapolis, including the burning down of a condo development and the 3rd precinct, would there be any movement in the streets at all right now? The immediate history of the movement indicates that rioting and looting are effective at growing a movement and making an issue come to the forefront. And these riots are destroying what last shreds of credibility President Trump had left, that and his terrible mishandling of the coronavirus, of course. So when I hear people saying, “Oh, rioting and looting isn’t part of the movement,” it strikes me that it is pure ideology. That all of those people came into the streets because of rioting and looting, they participated in rioting and looting — that is the movement. And to say that it distracts from the movement or it’s what the state wants, I think reflects at best a really intense confusion, and at worst an innately anti-Black and anti-liberatory perspective. You discuss organizing, as opposed to something like rioting, as being a bit of an obsession for a lot of people on the left, as being almost fetishized as the only right way to oppose the state and white supremacy. I would love for you to talk a little bit about why we should, in fighting white supremacy, be more skeptical of organizing and organizations, and what the risks and pitfalls are of relying on organizing as a tactic. There are lots of things that fall under the aegis of organizing that I think are very important. You know, calling protests, having meetings with people you care about, trying to politicize, reading, thinking together, these are all very important things that we should be doing. But formal organizations tend in my experience to emerge during lulls in street activity. So there’s a big uprising, there’s a lot of activity happening. And then it starts to recede and people worry rightly that the moment is slipping away and they want to hold on to that power that they felt, and they want to build from that moment. That impulse is admirable, and I share it and I think it’s beautiful, but it often then means that organizations are formed on the basis of a moment of a lull. They’re formed to keep activists active when the movement isn’t really very strong in the streets. As a result, organizations often take on tactics, strategies, habits, internal cultures that are based on keeping a small base of people active and in control. And this is just sort of innate and it just happens. It’s not really the fault of any one organizer. So when something happens in the streets that expands well beyond the remit of that organization, they either don’t know how to respond because it doesn’t fit in their modes of organizing, or they try to get in front of it, to control it, to funnel people into their organization, because during a lull, funneling people into their organization was the way that the movement stayed alive for them. Things get really, really unstable when a revolutionary moment, or even proto-revolutionary moment, opens up. Organizations are usually not willing to risk their very existence, to just throw it all into the movement. I thought that the way that you contrasted this with rioting was really intriguing because it’s true that, I think, we tend to see riots close to home especially, as you write, as not being a movement, but as being just an illogical outburst or a sort of explosion. And in some ways, maybe an organization or a leader allows us to sort of integrate the idea of a movement into our understanding of what’s happening, in a way that a leaderless, very grassroots movement with no identifiable people speaking for it in a cohesive way is difficult for the media to kind of grasp. I’m curious how we can come to understand riots as a form of movement, as a method of the movement happening, when our way of understanding the world around us is formed so much around great men and women and leaders and not around mass action. That’s one of the big projects in the book. I think we do have to change our understanding of history, actually. The way that we are taught history is very purposefully — not purposely like in a conspiracy way, but purposely — designed to emphasize certain kinds of real events led by leaders, by parliaments. If there is a movement in place, that movement must be summed up by its leaders and by its most important documents. One of the things that I’m trying to do in the book is to show a lot of examples of moments when that has led our understanding astray. One that I think is really important is what W.E.B. Du Bois calls the General Strike of the Enslaved, which is the movement of mass escape from plantations and strike that is building up before the Civil War, leads to and causes the Civil War, and then during the Civil War accelerates to such a point that 500,000 enslaved people all threw down their tools and escaped their plantations, or took them over, in the span of four years. To the extent that we think about that having a leader, people think about Abraham Lincoln. But Lincoln was very opposed to emancipation until it was forced upon him. He wanted to contain slavery in the South, as did the rest of the Republican Party, at the time. When 500,000 largely illiterate enslaved people who are separated by great distances on plantations, kept, as best they can be, ignorant by their masters, when they all rise up and respond to historical moments in the same way, that reveals a kind of organization. That’s what Du Bois is writing about: that this is a form of organization, but it is one that our bias towards formal card-carrying membership, leadership-based organization, makes invisible to us. So when riots happen, it is a similarly invisible organization that’s happening. There’ve been studies that show that the people who riot are often actually the most connected in their communities, they’re already activists or organized. They’re the people who are most involved in their community life. They have all this knowledge of their local areas and they fight on that basis. These forms of organization get made invisible and organizers have a tendency to demand that this informal organization be brought into a political party, a movement proper. And in doing that work, they often, organizers often will slow down the direct action that gave birth to the movement in an attempt to construct a structure. An interesting example of that, that we’re seeing right now, is that as the uprising continues there hasn’t been a strong organizational structure anywhere that I’m aware of that has really emerged. There have been these leaders who have tried to take control of things in certain ways, like you were talking about, the folks in New York who got on the bullhorn and tried to lead chants for the police or whatever, but there hasn’t actually been any — that I’m aware of — any formal organizations. Even relatively loose formal organizations of leftists haven’t been able to capture this moment. And that’s because the moment is ongoing and organizations — right now, where we’re at, the way that they’re formed — they are not productive for that. And there are lots of people in lots of organizations on the ground right now. I want to be clear, I’m not disrespecting people who are out there fighting every day. But the fact that no single organization has managed to coalesce the movement is a strength of the movement. You started talking about something that I’d love to have you explain in a little more detail, which is slavery and how it established the concept of looting and property and Blackness and its relationship to those things in the American consciousness. I’d love if you could talk a little bit about how we see slavery in America creating and hardening this white supremacist conception of property that leads to where we are today with the Black looter being a symbol of disorder and also of revolution and freedom. In the book, I worked through a premise that was in the original piece that I wrote in 2014, that this book is based on, which is that the first image of the Black looter is the enslaved freeing herself. The word looting didn’t exist in American English at that point — it’s entering into the English lexicon across the 19th century, so they weren’t described as looters. But as Saidiya Hartman writes about in her really important book, “Scenes of Subjection,” slaves understood their actions towards freedom as stealing. So if they had a secret meeting, they would call it “stealing the meeting.” And when they escaped, they called it stealing away. They were pointing their actions towards the abolition of property, by abolishing themselves as property through the movement of fugitivity. It’s a very, very long and complicated history. But in short, when the American colonies are being settled, the idea of whiteness doesn’t exist at all. Blackness exists, somewhat provisionally, but isn’t really fully established at that point. What you have is what Lerone Bennett Jr. refers to as an equality of oppression in the early colonies. So you had African slaves working side by side with often Irish, often other racialized European — Scots, Welsh — but also criminal Englishmen, servants, Indigenous servants too. As colonists arrive, to this new world, they have to claim that it is empty, that it is free, in order for them to justify taking it. But of course it is not empty and it is not theirs. There are Indigenous societies that have been around for thousands of years on the land. What they begin to do is they begin to develop notions of property that are good and European versus the idea of the savage. So the savage has no concept of property; they don’t actually have any real ownership to the land. And that concept of savagery is then also applied to the enslaved people and the servants in the colonies. But as the Indigenous population starts to fall to genocide, and as the African slave trade is increasingly rationalized and made more efficient, the African slave becomes cheaper to put on the plantation than the servants from Europe, and more available than the Indigenous who are, of course, succumbing to purposeful genocide. As that happens, an ideology begins to coalesce around, how do we justify this? Especially as the revolutionary era happened, and the U.S. colonists are talking about fighting for our freedom, for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So what do you do about all of these people who very clearly do not have life or liberty, or the pursuit of happiness? The pursuit of happiness is a modification of a Locke quote, which is the pursuit of estate. So the pursuit of happiness has always meant the acquisition of property. What do you do about these people who can’t acquire property because they are property? Race becomes the answer to this question. They are Black, they are inferior biologically, historically, culturally. And then whiteness starts to form in contradistinction to that. Whiteness is the thing that someone has that allows them to own a Black person, that allows them to own property, that gives them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So it develops on the ground through these historical processes of Southern colonialism and slavery. And so when Black folks freed themselves from the plantations, they were stealing themselves, they were abolishing themselves as property, and they were attacking the very notion of property and therefore the notion of whiteness. What that history hopefully sketches out is that whiteness and property are inextricably linked. And that if you want to fight against white supremacy and whiteness, you have to fight against the property that gives it its reason and its form. One thing we’re seeing in the current movement that I think is telling is that there’s a lot of discussion about racism and white supremacy and anti-Blackness, and there’s a lot of discussion about the police and their role in enforcing those things. The third term that connects them, private property, which is implicitly being attacked in riots and looting, which has been the subject of much of the force of the movement, has gone unremarked upon. People don’t talk about this movement being an attack on private property. And that’s because if we attack whiteness, private property and the police all at once, you’re talking about a revolution. I’d love to talk a little bit also about gender. I was really intrigued by your argument that looting and rioting are not masculine and in certain ways are actually quite femme. I would love to have you talk a little bit about why you see the idea of violence in the form of rioting and looting as not macho per se, and why we could see it as a more feminine kind of approach. There are a number of ways that we can use feminist analysis to talk about this. One thing that feminist analysis often focuses on is the question of social reproduction, of how we remake each other, how society keeps going and how often it falls to women and femmes to do that work, to do emotional caring labor, to do healing labor, to do education labor, to cook, to clean, et cetera. Riots and looting interact in the sphere of social reproduction. The way that a riot empowers you is, first of all, it makes it easier to live your life because you get lots of stuff for free, and it makes it much easier to reproduce your life. But they also are experienced as joyous, communal, empowering, community-reinforcing events. They genuinely reproduce the social, to put it really bluntly. Dividing things as femme and masc, it’s not always super productive having these sorts of binaries. But operating within those ideas, one thing that is often associated with femininity or femmeness is affect: acting on emotion, acting with the goal of emotion. And riots are very often about mourning and about grief and about rage and about pleasure and about joy. Whereas political campaigns tend to be much more, you know, quote-unquote “masc”: intellectualized, focused on reason and argument. Riots don’t argue with anybody. They just do the thing. One thing that I think is really misunderstood about riots by people who don’t participate in them, or don’t take them seriously, is when, in a riot, a group of people who experienced the city as an oppressive place suddenly experience it as joyful, celebratory, carnivalesque one. During a riot, you use physical force to repress the police and property, the very forces that make you unsafe in the street in the first place. So there is this violence, but it’s largely self-defensive, and it’s largely creating a territory in which you can safely, freely and happily reproduce your life. It’s a way of producing a zone of safety, and imagining a world where we’re all safe on the street all the time. It’s something that people have been talking a lot about this summer, and you’re touching on it here. I hear people out in the streets saying it, even people who aren’t engaged in the protests, but who are just amid them for some reason: just the joy that’s in the air and the feeling of safety and the feeling of mutual care. Why is it important to talk about things like rioting and looting through the lens of pleasure, as well as through lenses like self-defense and desperation, things that might frame the rioters more as acting purely out of victimhood and self-protection? It’s really important to think about riots in terms of pleasure and freedom and joy and safety, because that’s the world that they point towards and that they enact immediately. What we’re fighting for ultimately isn’t about violence and it isn’t about seriousness, and it isn’t for me even really about justice. It’s about a world of liberation, of freedom, of queer expression, of sexual and emotional and material peace and happiness. And I think one way that the framing of riots as macho, one thing that serves to do for the state is to take away what is actually really beautiful in a riot, and what, as you said, lots of people in the country have actually experienced, which is that the world could be different. We don’t have to live under these oppressions. We don’t have to live divided from each other by white supremacy and by settler colonialism, and by all of these forms of violence that are so historically powerful. Starting to see that freedom is an experience that changes everyone who participates in it. Part of what is so inspiring about this current moment is it’s been so widespread, and, you know, I read all these documents from the 60s, from the 30s, where people talk about how they never forget that feeling. Well, we now have a whole generation of people who’ve had that feeling and who never forget it. And it is so important for the state and the media and capitalism to try and repress that feeling, to confuse it, to blame it on white supremacists or white anarchists or outside agitators or whatever, because that feeling is so real and so immediate. The civility discourse has been a dominant one in mass media over the past few years, especially, and it’s been a very interesting juxtaposition to have it continue and get even more intense, even as we’re seeing people in the streets uprising, rebelling. One thing about the civility discourse is this idea of, like, certain tactics are good for everyone and certain tactics are bad for everyone. Is it an error for us to try to attach moral value to tactics? Is there a world in which we form rules of engagement for how we build a better society and we all adhere to them? Or is that just a totally misbegotten way of looking at how progress is achieved? Well, it’s going to be pretty ironic for someone who just wrote a book called “In Defense of Looting” to say the following, but I don’t think that we can really judge tactics outside of their context. I don’t think that any tactic at any point is morally or politically or ethically removed from the movement in which it appears. That’s why I spent two chapters talking about white rioting and police. It’s very important to recognize that no tactic is just good or bad. That said, I also don’t believe that the ends justify the means as an operating principle, because I think, you know, one of the really valuable anarchist insights into the world is that the things that we enact now in the world shape the world that we build. So, there’s been a lot of fetishizing of, for example, the guillotine. Which, like, I get it. It’s funny, like, you yell “guillotine” at a rich person, I totally get the appeal. But the guillotine is also a technology that is based on you having already kidnapped someone and then executing them. And that for me is very different from, say, defensive violence against the police to protect a riot zone, or burning down their building. Although these are all forms of violence. So I guess what I’m sort of saying is, yes and no. Tactics do shape our movements, they shape our outcomes. We are never going to make a list of tactics that are good and tactics that are bad, that is never going to be satisfying. That is never going to point the way to a freer society. What we can do is trust the people that we’re in movement with, trust them to know what they’re doing. Trusting that people are basically trying to get free and using the tactics that seem appropriate to that, and then understanding the world from that basis. So sometimes will you end up critiquing some tactics and thinking that they’re not good? Absolutely. And will some things seem counterproductive? Absolutely. If we start from the abstract plane of, what tactics are good, what tactics are bad? ― you heard me just dither about it! You end up in a spiral that doesn’t work. It’s sort of the wrong question. The question is, what are people doing right now? Is it working? Like, how can we help them? That’s the question that I think we have to be asking. Books and Culture Writer, HuffPost"
14,What We Need To Curb Violence In The U.S. (And It Isn’t More Prisons And Policing),social-justice," Guest Writer In reaction to increased violence in some American cities this summer, we’re witnessing the old familiar responses. As Chicago experienced record murders, President Donald Trump announced he would send in federal forces while the city’s police department sought to flood neighborhoods with cops. But these policing-focused efforts will not stop the cycle of violence so that everyone is safe. No one understands this better than the people who live in the communities that actually face the violence ― including those, like me, who have been victims. When I was 6 years old, I dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player. And in 2009, I was well on my way. I had just become the first man in my family to graduate from college and I was offered a contract to play in Europe. Then, just days before flying overseas to live my dream, I was leaving a convenience store near my home in Hartford, Connecticut, when I was shot in the back twice by strangers conducting a botched robbery. As the blood pooled out of me, I wondered if I could still play basketball, or if I would live at all. Those bullets ended my basketball career and changed my life forever. My lungs and legs were damaged, and all my attention went to relearning how to walk. I no longer felt safe in my own neighborhood. I experienced flashbacks and depression and was constantly on edge. I needed professional help to deal with the trauma and shock, but none was offered to me. Though my family did all they could, the access to services just wasn’t there. Meanwhile, my sense of what justice means was transformed. While I initially wanted retribution, my feelings changed when I learned that the young man who shot me had also been a victim of gun violence, causing him to lose sight in one eye when he was just a teenager. He didn’t receive any help for the trauma he went through either, and I realized that his unaddressed trauma had contributed to my own victimization. I knew I didn’t want to add to the cycle of violence and incarceration that already plagues cities like mine; I wanted healing and rehabilitation. Most of all, I wanted to bring safety to my community and to prevent such violence from ever happening again. This is a view shared by the majority of U.S. crime victims. A 2016 survey by the Alliance for Safety and Justice found that nearly two out of every three crime victims want shorter prison sentences, not longer ones. They also want more investment in prevention and rehabilitation. For many, their views come from knowing firsthand that people who have been hurt often end up hurting others. If this perspective comes as a surprise, it’s because survivors, especially those of us from the communities most harmed by violence, are rarely centered in discussions about American criminal justice and violence prevention. We should be, though. Crime survivors want a different approach. A national conversation is looking at how we can make more effective investments in public safety. Yet even now, our country remains addicted to traditional criminal justice responses. This remains true even though we spend $200 billion every year on policing and incarceration, put more people in prison than any other nation in the world, and still have many communities experiencing stunningly high rates of violence. “It’s time for public officials to start listening to the survivors, families and communities who experience violence and trauma firsthand.” Over-spending on the criminal justice system isn’t curbing the problem. In fact, most crimes in the U.S. never get solved or even reported, and most crime survivors never receive the services they need to feel safe. While young people of color are the most likely to experience a violent crime, they’re also the least likely to get help. Just 10% of violent crime survivors receive any support from a victim services agency. It’s time for public officials to start listening to the survivors, families and communities who experience violence and trauma firsthand. They are calling for investments in trauma recovery, violence intervention and other community-based safety programs as fundamental strategies to curb violence. We know this approach works. A John Jay College of Criminal Justice study found that a Cure Violence program in the South Bronx was associated with a 63% reduction in shooting victimizations compared to a similar neighborhood without the program. A National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers report found that victims of violent crime who get help through 35 innovative trauma recovery centers across the country show remarkable results: 93% of patients say they feel better emotionally after treatment and nearly 60% are more likely to return to work. With benefits like these, lawmakers should increase investments in trauma recovery centers and violence prevention programs in every state. Congress should provide critical funding for these essential safety initiatives. It’s urgent that we expand these efforts as the need for them increases amid the stress, trauma and widespread unemployment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hurt people hurt people, as survivors know. That’s why it’s imperative that lawmakers and other public officials stop wasting our resources on policies and practices that don’t work. We need solutions that prevent violence and help victims recover. After I was shot just over a decade ago, I thought my life was over. For eight months, I was too scared to leave my house. For over a year, I was too overwhelmed and traumatized to even think about looking for a job. Finally, I found purpose in helping other survivors.

15,"At The DNC, Democrats Embraced The Civil Rights Movement To Explain Their Place In The Present",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost The official program book for the 1936 Democratic National Convention featured a circular emblem with the names Roosevelt and Jefferson running around it, as if the then-president and his long-ago predecessor Thomas Jefferson were running mates. In President Franklin Roosevelt’s famous speech accepting his party’s nomination, he placed his fight against the “economic royalists” who had “carved new dynasties” and caused the Great Depression as a continuation of America’s historic opposition to tyranny, whether it be a British King or centralized wealth. “Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power,” Roosevelt said. Today, the Democratic Party tells a different story of its place in American history. Speaker after speaker at the 2020 Democratic National Convention reached to the more recent, but increasingly distant history of the civil rights movement to explain its purpose in the 21st century. Democratic nominee Joe Biden opened his acceptance speech Thursday night with a quote from civil rights icon Ella Baker, and other leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., C.T. Vivian, Fannie Lou Hamer, Diane Nash and the late Georgia congressman John Lewis were invoked during the week too. Lewis, the last living speaker at the March on Washington, who died on July 17, was repeatedly memorialized, including with a five-minute video eulogy that linked the party to the spirit of the movement through him. When politicians and political parties reach into the past for historical reference they do so in order to tell a story about the present. But America’s racism, white supremacy and xenophobia pose a complicating problem for politicians looking to explain themselves in American history for nonwhite audiences. That is a task that the Democratic Party, as it has transformed itself since the mid-20th century into the party of minority groups that were left out of the traditional American mythos, must do. Biden has made civil rights, and the fight against bigotry and racism, his origin story for seeking the presidency. When Trump said there were “very fine people” among “those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches,” in Charlottesville, Virginia on Aug. 12, 2017, Biden said Thursday night that “I knew I’d have to run.” Klansmen and white supremacists, “coming out of fields,” as if emerging from America’s history ― the same history the civil rights movement squared up against. He sought to join the battle for “the soul of America,” he said. “To save the soul of America.” That was the motto adopted by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference when it was formed under the leadership of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1957 as the civil rights movement ramped up in the South. Vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) traced her political roots to her parents ― a Black Jamaican man and an Indian woman ― who “fell in love … while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.” Harris, herself, “got a stroller’s-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called ‘good trouble.’” Harris accepted her party’s vice presidential nomination on behalf of the values her mother taught her. “And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans — one that Joe Biden shares,” she noted. The vision of America Harris sought to make real is of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Beloved Community,” she said, “where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love.” “Joe and I believe that we can build that Beloved Community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind,” Harris said. “One in which we all can see ourselves.” The civil rights movement is the historical point of reference that the party sees as its central animating mythos. It situates the party’s rights-based program within American history and gives meaning to the party among its base of Black Americans and other groups that continue to agitate for the expansion of rights and equal treatment before the law. It also comes as the party casts President Donald Trump’s open racism, virulent xenophobia, opposition to voting and civil rights and general indecency as in opposition to the United States itself and it looks to embrace the 21st century civil rights movement of Black Lives Matter. Biden praised the Movement for Black Lives, linked it to the mid-20th century movement and called on this generation of Americans to be the one that “finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character.” “Maybe George Floyd’s murder was the breaking point,” he said. “Maybe John Lewis’ passing the inspiration. However it has come to be, America is ready to in John’s words, to lay down ‘the heavy burdens of hate at last’ and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.” The civil rights movement itself is the most consequential political event in American politics in the past century and is now viewed as akin to a refounding of the nation. President Barack Obama implied as much by bestowing upon Lewis the label of “Founding Father” at his funeral. And the movement provides a link to the nation’s original founding that runs through America’s minority groups as its leaders cast their own arguments for equality, justice and jobs through a story about the Constitution. The “magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,” were “a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir,” Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said at the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963. But the nation had “defaulted on this promissory note,” King said, “in so far as her citizens of color are concerned.” “America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds,’” King said, adding, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.” This is what can be called the myth of the Constitution. That myth sees the Constitution as a promise of ever-expanding freedom and liberty as expressed in that document’s preamble, “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union.” These were the words Abraham Lincoln called upon in his first inaugural address, which inaugurated this myth of the Constitution, and by President Barack Obama in his most famous speech on race and America in 2008. It was this myth that prevailed throughout the convention as speakers wrapped themselves in the legend of the civil rights movement and the words “We the People” featured in every visual presentation for the party’s many policy stances. The Constitution “wasn’t a perfect document,” Obama said Wednesday night from the Museum of the Constitution in Philadelphia, as it allowed slavery and did not grant the right to vote to women. “But embedded in this document was a North Star that would guide future generations; a system of representative government — a democracy — through which we could better realize our highest ideals,” he said. This is not new territory for Obama, who praised “the true genius of America: that America can change” in his 2008 victory address. “Our union can be perfected. What we’ve already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow,” he said then. But Obama’s references to the Constitution and the civil rights movement on Wednesday did not evince the hope and joy of his 2008 run. It was rather a dire warning that Donald Trump represented the forces of reaction that lost to the civil rights movement reborn in a new era. That the arc of history may not bend toward justice if the people stop pulling it that way. For this reason, it was vital to still believe in the promise of the Constitution. The civil rights generation and those before them, Obama said, “had a right to believe that this democracy did not work, and could not work.” “They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives,” he said. “They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the myth. And yet, instead of giving up, they joined together and said somehow, some way, we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words, in our founding documents, to life.” Today, he said, he saw the same spirit in the Movement for Black Lives and other movements for climate justice and gun control fueled by youth activism. “You can give our democracy new meaning,” he said. “You can take it to a better place. You’re the missing ingredient — the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed.” The adoption of a civil rights movement mythos by the party is not mere nostalgia. It is necessary to situate the party in a history accessible to younger generations, who will be less and less white. The nation as a whole is expected to be 50% nonwhite in approximately 25 years. Those young Democratic Party voters also have policy priorities that diverge from the top of the ticket and the current party establishment. That’s why large numbers of them supported the primary runs of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016 and 2020 and support more populist economic appeals. When Roosevelt sought to appeal to class-based economic appeals in 1936 he reached back to the party’s touchstones of Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, who both evinced suspicion and hostility to organized wealth and monopoly. Those two ― particularly Jackson ― may be off-limits as a political party’s organizing mythos if it seeks to appeal to the younger generation due to their role as enslavers, and Jackson’s ethnic cleansing policies. Dozens of state and local Democratic Party committees have already renamed their annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinners to remove the names of the two former presidents. But a civil rights movement mythos needn’t be restricted to the struggle for voting rights and against Jim Crow that it is most commonly deployed to argue for in the present. It was also a movement for issues beyond the voting booth that ranged from housing policy to monetary policy to banking policy to labor policy, all of which were fully represented in the multiracial 1968 Poor People’s Campaign push for economic and social justice. John Lewis’ mentor Rev. James Lawson, Jr. detailed this broader version of the civil rights movement in the eulogy he delivered for his former pupil. The late Lewis, Lawson said, “practiced the politics of the preamble to the Constitution of the United states.” But those politics were not limited to voting rights. “The media makes a mistake when John is seen only in relation to the Voting Rights bill of ’65,” Lawson said. “However important that is you must not remember that Lyndon Johnson and the Congress of the United States passed the most advanced legislation on behalf of ‘We the People’ of the United States that was ever passed.” Education programs like Head Start, billions in funding for public housing, Medicare and anti-poverty programs, Lawson listed. These were the precursors to the, “21st century social, economic, and human rights,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said at the convention on Tuesday night that Sanders’ young supporters campaigned and voted for in 2020. As the Democratic Party moves forward, each faction can find something to use in the mythos of the civil rights movement that might bring them closer together. But for now party supporters and civil rights activists will judge a Biden-Harris administration, if it comes to pass, on whether or not its actions live up to the myths they’ve wrapped themselves in.

0,Los Angeles Police Investigate Attack On 3 Transgender Women As A Hate Crime,social-justice," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the filmed assault of three transgender women this week as a possible hate crime. Widely circulated cell phone footage showed an unidentified man hurling anti-LGBTQ epithets at Joslyn Allen, Jaslene Busanet and Eden Estrada early Monday. Other clips appear to show the suspect threatening Allen with a crowbar and hitting Busanet with a bottle as a group of bystanders look on. The three victims said their purses and phones, as well as pieces of jewelry and clothing, were stolen in the attack. Prior to the incident, they were waiting for an Uber on Hollywood Boulevard. Since Monday, news of the alleged attack made national headlines, much of it driven by the preeminence of the victims. Estrada is a popular YouTube personality who goes by the name Eden the Doll and boasts more than 440,000 Instagram followers. Information on a Robbery-Hate Crime that occurred on Monday, August 17, 2020 at approximately 2:15 a.m., on the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard. Any info contact Hollywood Robbery Detectives at (213) 972-2934. pic.twitter.com/8HA80xYgEv Busanet is known as Jaslene White Rose, and Allen is known as Joslyn Flawless on social media, and together they have more than 174,000 Instagram followers. “It was absolutely the worst day of my life,” Estrada said in a Tuesday interview with CBSLA. “I know that I’m so privileged, because I am a YouTuber and because people know who I am, but this happens all the time to women like me who aren’t on social media. We need this to stop.” Allen shared similar sentiments on Instagram. “He held a crowbar to my face and threatened to kill me unless I stripped my shoes off and gave him my jewelry and all my processions,” she wrote. “He said if I was trans, he would kill me. He then forced me to hold his hand while he looks for my friends to kill them for being trans.” The LAPD referred to the case as both a robbery and a hate crime on Twitter Wednesday. HuffPost reached out to the police for additional comment. “Pose” star Indya Moore and singer Zhavia Ward, meanwhile, shared images and video of the alleged attack on social media to raise awareness. News of the incident came amid a troubling spate of anti-transgender violence across the U.S. At least 26 transgender or gender-nonconforming people were killed by violent means in 2020, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Sadly, that figure seems poised to exceed 2017’s record of 29 such deaths. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

2,Criminal Justice Reform Advocates Don’t Plan To Let A Biden Administration Off The Hook,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost Prisoner advocates and formerly incarcerated people came together virtually on Monday — on the first day of the Democratic National Convention — to urge presidential candidate Joe Biden and his vice presidential pick, Kamala Harris, to prioritize criminal justice reform if they get to the White House. Harris, a California senator, is “really familiar with the landscape of incarceration,” said Susan Burton, who was formerly incarcerated and founded A New Way of Life, an advocacy group to help women in Ohio with reentry into life outside of prison. Her hope is that, if Harris becomes vice president, she “looks at the lack of resources in our communities to create successful reentry.” “We’re rooting for her to come in high and hard and swinging like we know she can,” Burton said. “Come in hard, Kamala, swinging hard!” Burton and other formerly incarcerated people participated in Rebuilding the Table, a two-day virtual event discussing the criminal justice system, timed to coincide with the Democratic National Convention. The unofficial DNC event, hosted by JustLeadershipUSA, was meant to “encourage Democratic officials and the general public to ensure that the next administration” makes sure that people “with lived experience have a seat and voice at the table” on criminal justice reform, said JustLeadershipUSA President DeAnna Hoskins. With convention delegates prepared to officially nominate former Vice President Biden and Harris as the presidential ticket this week — and amid months-long protests against police brutality and racism — some progressives and criminal justice advocates have expressed the complicated apprehensions of voting for Biden and Harris despite criticism for their roles in perpetuating certain inequities in the criminal justice system. “I know both of their history, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. And their history definitely is something that wasn’t in my benefit and individuals like me that are incarcerated,” Jimmie Gardner, a man who was wrongfully imprisoned for over 25 years, told HuffPost before Monday’s event, at which he also spoke. “But we have to be capable of moving forward and be in a position to try to say, ‘This is where I’m at now.’ I always tell people, ‘It’s not how you start; it’s how you finish.’” Hoskins, meanwhile, celebrated that Harris made history when she was selected as the vice presidential candidate last week: “What gives me hope in this moment is the fact that the first Black woman actually is on a major ticket for the second-highest office in this country.” Part of the “joy and the hope” Hoskins has is that when her organization held the first Democratic presidential forum hosted by formerly incarcerated people in October 2019, “Harris was the first confirmed primary candidate to walk into that room.” “Not only did she come, she heard our voices and she engaged,” Hoskins added. “It’s a moment we need — directly impacted communities, African American communities — to have a society that doesn’t judge us on our past. In this moment, I think we have individuals in position who are willing to hear our voices, willing to sit down with us and actually acknowledge the past and say, ‘How do we move to a future?’” As a senator, Biden supported legislation that would increase mandatory minimum sentences for drug arrests. He also helped author the infamous 1994 crime bill that led to skyrocketing rates of incarceration of Black and brown people. Harris’s record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general came under scrutiny during her primary run, specifically for opposing proposals that would have furthered criminal justice reform and pursuing some policies that disproportionately harmed Black and brown families. Harris said during her presidential campaign last year that there was more she could have done as a top prosecutor but pointed to her criminal justice plans, which included ending mass incarceration and shutting down for-profit prisons. Biden’s 2020 platform around criminal justice reform calls for reducing prison populations and addressing racist disparities in the criminal justice system, including by incentivizing states to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes and pushing to end cash bail nationwide. Ahead of Monday’s event, HuffPost spoke to Gardner about his experience with the criminal justice system. When Gardner was 23 and playing for the Chicago Cubs’ then-farm team in Charleston, West Virginia, he was arrested and charged in the robbery and sexual assault of two women. Despite both women saying that Gardner was not the perpetrator ― his blood, DNA and physical appearance did not match ― Gardner was convicted of the charges related to one of the women after state police serologist Fred Zain provided forensic evidence that was later found to be falsified. The judge sentenced Gardner, an innocent man, to 110 years in prison in 1990. Three years later, the West Virginia Supreme Court found that Zain had a history of falsifying evidence in criminal prosecutions and said that all evidence offered up by him in any criminal case should be deemed invalid. But Gardner spent 23 more years in prison before finally getting released in 2016, with all charges dropped and his sentence vacated. He’s currently engaged in litigation to receive compensation for his wrongful imprisonment. “The trauma is real. I mean, I don’t want to have my back to anything. I smile and I’m happy and I’m moving forward, but there are certain things ― I still hear [flashbacks] from my … experience in lockup,” Gardner told HuffPost. “It was a lot of different violence happening, so I was in a mode of survival.” Since his release, Gardner has been fighting for prison reform and advocating for others whose lives have been uprooted and traumatized due to the dehumanization and racism embedded in mass incarceration.

3,Far Right Seizes On Italy’s Renewed Coronavirus Restrictions To Bash Immigration,social-justice," Senior Editor, HuffPost On Sunday, Italy announced that it is shutting discos and nightclubs for three weeks as the number of coronavirus cases has increased, particularly among young people. It’s the first reimposition of restrictions in the country, which for so long was the center of the global pandemic, since the government began easing its lockdown in May. “We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months. Our priority must be that of opening schools in September, in full safety,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Facebook. Speranza on Saturday urged young people to be as cautious as possible, as “if they infect their parents and their grandparents, they risk creating real damage.” In addition to closing nightspots, the government is requiring that face masks be worn between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. in areas close to bars and pubs, and where gatherings are more likely. Italy had kept clubs open despite mounting criticism that they attracted large crowds, that social distancing was not being respected and masks were not being worn. But new cases in the past week were more than double the number three weeks ago. And to the country’s far-right politicians, the resurgent coronavirus crisis has provided fresh fodder for their anti-immigrant agenda. Now, the reimposition of restrictions on regular Italian life at the exact moment migrant boats have begun landing has enabled the far right to stoke the fears of Italians afraid of an imported coronavirus second wave. “The only problem related to the virus is not the boys who dance but those who disembark,” Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Lega Party, said at a news conference last week, per HuffPost Italy. “The enemy is not the boy who goes to the beach, disco or restaurant, but the thousands of migrants who land on our shores.” “Another 100 landed tonight,” Massimo Casanova, a Lega member who owns a nightclub in the beach town of Milano Marittima, told HuffPost Italy. “What is the point of picking on companies? This government has no idea what it means to run a business.” In recent weeks, a steady stream of asylum-seekers have arrived in Italy, particularly from Tunisia, whose economy has been ravaged as a consequence of the pandemic. According to The Guardian, 1,277 migrants from Tunisia were intercepted by Italian authorities in the first six months of 2019. This year, that number rose to 6,628. More than 4,000 migrants were intercepted by Italian authorities in July alone. With more and more boats arriving from Tunisia every day, the Italian island of Lampedusa has reportedly run out of room to quarantine new migrants, and tensions have flared amid worries that the new arrivals could lead to a new spike in coronavirus cases. With little room on Lampedusa, migrants are being transferred to other quarantine centers, putting local mayors on a war footing. “I don’t understand why the premier doesn’t declare a state of emergency” on Lampedusa, the island’s mayor, Toto Martello, told the Giornale di Sicilia newspaper. Italian prosecutors are investigating two recent attacks against pro-migrant symbols in Lampedusa — a fire that burned hundreds of abandoned boats in the island’s “migrant boat graveyard,” and the vandalism of the Gateway to Europe monument, erected in 2008 as a memorial to migrants who died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean. However, Giusi Nicolini, Lampedusa’s former mayor who won the UNESCO Peace Prize in 2017 for her work with migrants, has stressed that there “is no emergency.” “They say we are overrun for political purposes,” Nicolini told the La Stampa newspaper. For politicians like Salvini, the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed 35,000 lives in Italy since February, is just the latest excuse to demonize immigrants. During his tenure as Italy’s interior minister from June 2018 to September 2019, he repeatedly denied ships carrying migrants access to the country’s ports. Italian prosecutors have sought to bring kidnapping charges against Salvini in three such cases, and the Italian parliament voted last month to lift Salvini’s immunity from prosecution. Yet Italian authorities have continued to turn their backs on migrants seeking assistance. In April, the government declared the country’s ports “unsafe” due to the coronavirus pandemic and said it would not authorize the landing of migrant boats — an unprecedented move. “For the entire duration of the health emergency, due to the outbreak of coronavirus, Italian ports cannot be classified as ‘safe places’ for the landing of people rescued from boats flying a foreign flag,” the government stated in an official decree. In July, humanitarian groups photographed an Italian coast guard ship ignoring a migrant boat that was adrift in the Mediterranean with about 60 people on board. While the rhetoric of politicians like Salvini has fanned the flames of division, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has been blasted over his silence on the arrivals. During mass landings and escapes from reception centers in the final week of July, Conte was criticized for simply claiming that “the situation is complex.” Meanwhile, humanitarian groups say there is little evidence that migrants are fueling the spread of coronavirus. “There is no correlation,” Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, told Politico. “The far right will use whatever they find to create their anti-migrant message.” With reporting from HuffPost Italy and Reuters.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

7,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,"Jordan Klepper Quizzes Trump Fans About Jan. 6, And It Goes Just As You'd Expect",social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jordan Klepper is back out in Trump World to see what the MAGA supporters are taking from the Jan. 6 House select committee hearings. (Hint: It’s nothing.) “The Daily Show” correspondent interviewed supporters of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Mississippi to see if the damning evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating the U.S. Capitol attack, was cutting through at all. Most people said they weren’t watching the hearings. Two women didn’t even know what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. And, as Klepper observed, “For almost everyone here, insurrectioning was a non-issue. It was the hearings themselves that were the problem.” And when Klepper showed attendees footage of former Attorney General William Barr saying Trump’s electoral fraud claims were “bullshit” and Ivanka Trump saying she believed Barr, they still didn’t buy it. Watch below on “The Daily Show.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
10,The Unfinished Work Of The 19th Amendment,social-justice," In the middle of the blazing summer of 1848, more than 300 people gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, for the nation’s very first women’s rights conference. By the end of that convention, the participants would vote on 11 women’s rights resolutions, including the affirmation that women in the United States of America should have the right to vote. (Notably, it was the only resolution that did not pass unanimously.) But despite making proclamations that would impact American women as a collective — and the diverse coalition of women who made up the suffrage movement — the only Black American at Seneca Falls was Frederick Douglass. Decades later, in August 1920, the United States finally ratified the 19th Amendment, most often remembered in the collective American imagination as the moment when women got the right to vote. But in fact, the 19th was not a guarantee of enfranchisement for all women, but rather a guarantee that states could not bar people from voting due to their sex. This left ample room for states to suppress and disenfranchise on the basis of wealth and race, and they quickly did through Jim Crow laws, which included poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses. As with the convention at Seneca Falls, Black women, many of whom had fought long and hard for women’s enfranchisement, were largely left behind even as the white-dominated national suffragist organizations moved on. One hundred years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, we are still grappling with its fractured, incomplete outcomes. “There’s power in the legacy of the 19th Amendment,” said Amanda Brown Lierman, organizer director at Supermajority, a women’s voting rights organization. “But it’s important to acknowledge that the 19th Amendment did not give the right to vote to all women. In fact, much of the movement at that time excluded and marginalized the voices of Black women in particular. In that space, we still have a long way to go.” The Long Fight For The Vote The women’s suffrage movement is most often associated with white figures: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt and Alice Paul. And while these women did play a major role in the eventual ratification of the 19th Amendment, there were plenty of Black women and other women of color who fought for those rights, too, such as Sojourner Truth and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. And they were ultimately failed by the movement. Many in the first generation of suffragists were also abolitionists and set aside their goal of enfranchisement for women to help in the fight against slavery during the Civil War. Once the North won, many suffragists believed that all people would be given the right to vote. Instead, suffragists were asked to support the 15th Amendment, which only extended the right to vote to Black men, who died by the thousands in the Civil War. Stanton and Anthony, along with some other white suffragists, believed that if only one group could get the vote first, it should be white, educated women. To see Black men enfranchised over white women infuriated many white suffragists. The causes of abolition and women’s suffrage, once compatible, became increasingly at odds with one another. In the late 19th century, as women were fighting for the right to vote, Southern states were busy disenfranchising Black men using grandfather clauses, literacy tests, polling taxes and violence. The National American Woman Suffrage Association, co-founded by Stanton, Anthony, Catt and Lucy Stone, decided it would be politically expedient to simply exclude Black women. Black women who had once been prominent in the suffrage movement were excluded, with some Southern NAWSA chapters refusing Black members altogether. By 1896, Black suffragists including Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, Ida B. Wells-Barnett and Harriet Tubman formed the National Association of Colored Women. Some white suffragists were actively hostile to Black voting rights, while others were not overtly racist but still comfortable with excluding Black women when it was politically expedient to do so, said Corrine M. McConnaughy, political scientist and author of “The Woman Suffrage Movement in America: A Reassessment.” “To point to their choices and stress the need to understand them isn’t to single out the activists, but to foreground how deeply race structured the political system and how much that mattered to the prospects for a truly broad and integrated women’s movement,” McConnaughy said. By 1913, the second generation of suffragists had arrived, in coalition with the labor movement. Alice Paul and Lucy Burns formed the National Woman’s Party, organizing a parade of 5,000 to 10,000 marchers down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. While there was a smattering of Black suffragists at the parade, including members of a Howard University sorority, marchers were primarily white women. Wells-Barnett, who was already famous at the time for her work in anti-lynching and women’s suffrage, was asked to march with a contingent in the back because she was Black. In the years that followed, Paul began introducing some of the more militant tactics practiced by the British suffragists earlier in the century. She and other suffragists were arrested after picketing at the White House for months, and they went on a hunger strike while imprisoned. The tide for suffrage turned when a referendum on women’s right to vote passed in 1917 in New York, the most populous state in the country at the time. Black women’s clubs and the NAACP organized around the push and were integral in the passage of the referendum. Southern politicians were terrified of Black women becoming enfranchised, with one Mississippi senator reportedly saying, “That will be the end of white supremacy if Black women get the vote.” Although some Southern lawmakers pushed to edit the amendment to only include white women, Black women’s organizations, specifically the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs, ensured that this modification never came to fruition. The bad press that swirled around the treatment of suffragists in prison, as well as women’s essential roles in World War I, finally forced President Woodrow Wilson’s hand to support women’s suffrage. After being pushed through the House, the Senate and 36 states, the amendment — originally introduced to Congress in 1878 — was finally passed, becoming the 19th Amendment to the Constitution on Aug. 18, 1920. Fulfilling The Promise Of The 19th Amendment In some respects, it’s miraculous to think about the fact that just a century ago, women could be barred from voting on the basis of their gender. Over the last 100 years, women went from being predominantly disenfranchised to becoming more than half of the electorate. Black women became the nation’s most consistent voters. Women are running — and winning — races at every level of our government. In the last federal election, there was a female nominee of a major party for president of the United States. This time around, there is a Black and South Asian woman on the Democratic ticket. There is a female speaker of the House. The arguably brightest rising star in Congress is a woman. Just last month, women united on the House floor to call out a culture that labels women “bitches” for daring to take up space at all. Gender is still a very real barrier for women seeking power in this country — see: every sexist attack made against Hillary Clinton in 2016 — but there are indeed women seeking that power, and winning it. But these wins also serve to remind us who has continued to be left behind. “This moment calls for real, honest reflection so that we can continue to stand on the work that was done and the progress that was made, but also learn from the mistakes,” said Lierman, the organizer director of Supermajority. Nearly a century after suffragists won the right to vote, many American women are still struggling to cast their ballots. In Black and brown communities especially, women face barriers to voter registration and early voting access, as well as strict voter ID requirements — legacies of the Jim Crow era. Over 6 million Americans are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction, and those in prison are disproportionately people of color. Many women, especially low-income women, struggle to take time off to get to the polls because Election Day is still not a national holiday, and when they finally arrive, they’re often met with hourslong lines and broken machines. Transgender women and gender-nonconforming people are often turned away at polls because the name or gender marker on their IDs does not match how they present. Immigrant and Indigenous women still face many hurdles before getting to the ballot box. “All of our rights are bound up together — our broadest pro-democracy coalition is the best one,” said political scientist McConnaughy. “If we each call the work ‘done’ once we have a seat at the table, someone will be ready to start pushing seats back — including our own.” The 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment is not a time for simple celebrations, but for more complicated reckonings and calls to action. “The overarching legacy [of the 19th Amendment] is the lesson that democracy is always unfinished business that requires broad and concerted effort to maintain and improve,” said McConnaughy. 2020 is the time to continue the project our foremothers started and do better. To that end, HuffPost spoke with nine women across the country who are still fighting to expand the electorate and make our democracy what the rosiest views of the United States imagine it to be. Jaida A. Hampton, Lexington, Kentucky WRITTEN BY TARYN FINLEY Halfway into Jaida A. Hampton’s final semester at the University of Kentucky, three Louisville police officers killed Breonna Taylor in her bed during a no-knock raid. It shook Hampton’s world and mobilized her in the same beat. “Being a Black woman in Kentucky, living alone, just to know that any moment someone could barge through my door because they feel they have the right to it has my anxiety through the roof,” Hampton said. She began protesting in the streets a week after Taylor’s death, about two months before her story made national headlines. And on July 14, police arrested Hampton at one of those protests, making her all the more determined to do her part to fight for justice, including at the ballot box. Hampton and 86 other protesters with the social justice organization Until Freedom held a demonstration in front of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s house, calling for the arrest of Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove, the officers who shot Taylor. Police told the protesters to leave the area or risk arrest; instead, Hampton and the other protesters sat down on Cameron’s lawn, linked arms and chanted “Say her name. Breonna Taylor.” They continued to chant as police arrested them, during the 20-minute ride to the precinct and throughout the duration of their detainment from 6 p.m. to 11:20 a.m. Though surrounded by about 21 other protesters in her cell — and officers, many of whom weren’t wearing masks — Hampton felt alone, worrying about her future. “I was thinking about when you fill out a job application and they ask, have you ever been to jail? Do you have a felony? And I sat there and I thought about that,” she said. “I thought about how I could potentially lose my job and my right to vote.” Hampton was charged with a felony for intimidating a participant in the legal process and two misdemeanors for disorderly conduct and trespassing. The felony charge was eventually dropped, and Until Freedom created a petition demanding the same for all charges against the protesters. The entire experience was traumatizing and dehumanizing. The arrested protesters were “being treated like a criminal in a sense for what we believed in,” Hampton said. But she said the other protesters locked up with her formed an even tighter community in their cells. Though Hampton has been socially aware since Chicago police killed Laquan McDonald in her hometown in 2014, that night helped further motivate Hampton to pivot from focusing on sports entertainment law to civil and criminal law. Taylor’s killing was an unfortunate reminder that Black women are not protected in the U.S., Hampton said. “The fight became super personal,” Hampton said. “We’ve seen justice get served, or even if it’s just a little bit of justice, get served for males. But when it comes down to women, it’s much harder.” She recognizes that Black women face injustice in nearly every other area, including voting and the whitewashed legacy of the 19th Amendment and women’s suffrage. Hampton knew about the voting rights work done by the founders of her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, as well as the racism they faced while marching in the back of the 1913 Women’s Suffrage Procession. But she had no idea how much other history was left out of her textbooks — such as Ida B. Wells’ and Sojourner Truth’s work for women’s voting rights — until she served as a legislative fellow for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) and visited a women’s museum in 2019. For Hampton, in an ideal world, the cops who killed Taylor would be fired, arrested and charged — two of them are still with the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department — and more Black women would be leading this country. “No one can lead like a Black woman, to be honest,” she said. She knows there’s still much work to be done. So she’s working to register others to vote while educating her community on issues and the power of Black women’s vote. “Our political participation is known for being powerful and a necessary survival strategy. But it’s not just for us as Black women. ... It’s also for our future children and our loved ones and the generations to come after us,” Hampton said. “I look at Tiffany Dena Loftin, Tamika Mallory, Michelle Obama, Ida B. Wells, Shirley Chisholm. So continuing building each other up as Black women and being seen as the leaders that we are [is important].” . . “As a young Black woman, seeing the ways the U.S. government has [historically] tried to keep me from voting, it just shows you how much power there is in voting.” AMIRA TRIPP FOLSOM, PORTLAND, OREGON . . Amira Tripp Folsom, Portland, Oregon WRITTEN BY EMMA GRAY Two months after Amira Tripp Folsom entered high school, Donald Trump was elected. The now 18-year-old, who was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, was just beginning young adulthood in 2016. The only president she had ever been cognizant of was former President Barack Obama, so seeing the political pendulum swing so severely in the other direction shook her. “I was just like, there’s no way they’re going to let that happen,” said Folsom, “and then you get to Election Day. I felt really let down by the people who could vote and were supposed to be making decisions that would affect my life, too.” The experience also made her determined to use her own vote wisely. “I was just like, OK, if I’m going to have any say in this, this cannot happen again,” she said. Four years later, in the midst of a global pandemic, Folsom does have a say, and has spent the last few years advocating to widen the pool of young people who are allowed that say — first through the youth leadership organization Next Up Oregon, and now as a member of the Youth Advisory Board of Vote16, a national campaign that supports local efforts to expand voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds at the state and local level. (This has already happened in places like Takoma Park, Maryland.) She is passionate about creating a generation of “active and engaged and informed” voters and sees voting as a habit that needs to be established early. “Young people consistently have not shown up to vote the same way that older age groups have,” said Folsom. “And it’s not really the fault of young people because [it’s] not something that we’re trained to do. When you lower the voting age to 16, it really helps young people build the habit of voting, because voting and being civically engaged is a muscle that needs to be exercised.” Folsom sees her work as part of a long legacy of women of color fighting to expand the electorate. She used to find personal meaning in reading about suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. But as she’s delved more into the history of the suffrage movement in America, she’s felt increasingly like many of the most famous white suffragists weren’t actually fighting for women like her. “How can you take pride in something that still actively held other women down?” she asked. “Within the women’s suffrage movement, there was a lot of racism and exclusion. So I think that while they did make positive change, I don’t think they necessarily made positive change for me in particular.” She sees echoes of the unsteady, uneven coalition between Black suffragists and white suffragists in the often unsteady, uneven coalitions between Black and white women today. Folsom believes that time and time again, white women have ultimately opted to “choose their whiteness over their womanhood” — as demonstrated by the oft-quoted percentage of white female voters who voted for Trump over fellow white woman Hillary Clinton in 2016. “White women don’t necessarily show up for Black women and other women of color the way Black women and other women of color show up for them,” Folsom said Folsom hopes that white women will recognize the privilege that they hold and use it wisely by fighting against voter ID laws, felon disenfranchisement and voter suppression and disenfranchisement in Native American communities. Folsom plans to continue her work with Vote16 and to (somewhat unenthusiastically) vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden come November. She’ll be thinking not just about who is going to fill the role of president, but about how that person will address the global pandemic, who could be appointed to the Supreme Court, and who might be appointed to the Cabinet and voted into Congress. “I’m just trying to think about the future of this country,” said Folsom. “As a young Black woman, seeing the ways the U.S. government has [historically] tried to keep me from voting, it just shows you how much power there is in voting. And I need people to understand that’s not something that you should just relinquish.” Tara Benally, San Juan County, Utah WRITTEN BY BROOKLYN WAYLAND Tara Benally, who is of Hopi and Navajo descent, spent part of her childhood living in the Navajo Nation, where she fetched water from the nearest spring, burned lamp oil to do her homework and learned the traditional Navajo ways from her grandmother. She spent the rest of her time away from the reservation, where she saw the gaps between what people outside reservations could access and what was available to those inside. Benally’s upbringing taught her to love and want to support her community. As her grandmother reminded her daily, “We need to make something happen; we need to build homes here for other families and for our kids; we have to make a change.” After college, Benally moved back to the Navajo Nation and helped build homes for people in the community, but she soon saw that much more needed to be done. She got involved in legal assistance and advocacy. And though she never expected to be involved in politics, she eventually turned her focus to ensuring that Native people are able to exercise their right to vote as field director for the Rural Utah and Rural Arizona Project. Encouraging members of her community to vote isn’t always easy, particularly because it’s not a typical cultural practice for many. The tribe’s political system places individuals in power out of respect for their knowledge, not based on votes. Plus, the U.S. government has excluded tribal members from its voting systems in one form or another for generations. Although the 19th Amendment granted American women the right to vote in 1920, Native Americans weren’t granted U.S. citizenship until four years later, and their struggle for voting rights has taken much longer than that. For years, many states would still not recognize them as U.S. citizens. The last state to guarantee voting rights to Native Americans was Utah, in 1962. After years of poll taxes, intimidation and literacy tests kept Native Americans from voting, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped solidify their right to vote. But many Native Americans are still unable to access that right because of language barriers, lack of access to transportation, and address requirements that disqualify Native Americans on reservations who may not have a “proper” address to list when they register to vote. Many polling stations do not have interpreters for Indigenous languages. Benally focuses on voter registration in Native communities and provides education on the election process. In 2018, her program was able to register 1,600 members of the Navajo Nation to vote in a San Juan County special election, enabling two Navajo citizens to gain commission seats. “We may be oppressed in so many different areas, but we are still a rich nation, we are still a very proud nation,” Benally said of the Navajo Nation. She’s proud of her work, which she sees as part of a long line of strong and outspoken women in her family. “It is empowering to me as a woman that I can look back and honestly say we are really making a change for the people,” Benally said. “We have heard our people’s cries; we have heard our people’s stories, wants and needs to make this nation the great nation it was before the western movement.” . . “There’s still work to do. And there’s an enormous amount of responsibility on me to answer the call.” TEQUILA JOHNSON, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE . . Tequila Johnson, Nashville, Tennessee WRITTEN BY JENAVIEVE HATCH For the last five years, Tequila Johnson has worked to reach out to Black voters in Tennessee, a state with such a history of voter suppression that it was one of the five worst states for voter turnout in the last four presidential elections, with even lower turnout rates for midterms. Johnson’s entry into politics in 2015 came after a lifetime of experiences with systemic injustice and a period of personal upheaval and exhaustion. She was the new mother of a 4-week-old daughter, and her baby’s father was going through parole issues after being incarcerated. She had just finished her master’s degree and was sitting on six figures of student loan debt. She’d experienced police violence in high school, and her father had been incarcerated. “I had almost grown immune to injustice. It started to feel like this is just the way of life for Black people,” Johnson said. “It just felt like no matter how hard I work, or how deep I tried to dig myself out of this hole, more dirt was being put on my head. And that really opened my eyes, because I realized at that moment that … a lot of the social ills that plague my community, and my family, and me personally, were symptoms of a larger system that was being controlled by the few, but impacting the many.” Johnson began to participate in local politics by going to Nashville City Council and school board meetings, as well as setting up meetings with state legislators to talk about educational disparities in her community. Through that work, what stood out to Johnson was how Black people and poor people, who were most affected by legislation, were also the ones who were “so apathetic to the system” that they didn’t even want to participate in it. That’s why she co-founded The Equity Alliance, an organization centered on involving Black Tennesseeans in the democratic process, in 2016. She now serves as co-executive director. The organization is up against major challenges. Voter suppression has long been a part of legalized discrimination in Tennessee — the 15th Amendment was only formally ratified there in 1997. Currently, 21% of Black people in Tennessee have lost the right to vote via the state’s voter disenfranchisement law. As recently as last year, Republican lawmakers in the state passed another voter suppression bill — essentially forcing extreme regulations and burdens on grassroots organizations conducting voter drives in underrepresented communities. The bill came after The Equity Alliance, in conjunction with the Tennessee Black Voter Project, registered nearly 90,000 people of color in 2018, shattering their initial goal of 35,000. In response to the 2019 voter suppression bill, The Equity Alliance launched the Aye-for-an-Aye campaign and a statewide listening tour, pledging to register 100 voters for every “Aye” the voter suppression bill received. The goal was to register at least 7,200 new voters; Johnson said the group surpassed it by an extra 8,000 or so. “When you talk about social justice and liberation, we have this notion to come from a place of trauma,” Johnson told HuffPost. “I wanted to build something that wasn’t rooted in trauma, rooted in negativity … The Equity Alliance is built around the world we want people to have access to — not necessarily what we are fighting against, but what we’re fighting for.” As 2020 marks a century since women gained the right to vote, Johnson credits the Black women who came before her for inspiring her fight to get Black Tennesseans engaged in the democratic process. “The 19th Amendment was awesome, but it did not grant Black women the right to vote,” Johnson said. “Even though we fought on the front lines of that movement, even though our ancestors were chastised and were essentially ridiculed by that movement … that is a testament to our strength.” “There’s still work to do,” she said. “And there’s an enormous amount of responsibility on me to answer the call.” Diana Colín, Los Angeles County, California WRITTEN BY BROOKLYN WAYLAND As a high school student, Diana Colín remembers darting from hallway to hallway and in and out of the quad, trying desperately to avoid her high school counselor. The counselor was trying to help her apply for financial aid and had asked for Colín’s Social Security number. As an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 2, Colín didn’t have one. Twelve years later, Colín found herself in those same school hallways. But this time she walked confidently with a ballot in her hand, waiting to cast her vote in the 2020 presidential primary as a U.S. citizen. Colín gained citizenship in 2017 and voted for the first time the following year. She and her sister, who had just turned 18, went to the polls together to cast their first votes. “It was so powerful to have two Latina women of color, immigrants and daughters of immigrants voting together,” Colín said. That’s the goal for many people in the immigrant community, she said: to finally get to have a say in the places they work, pay taxes, send their kids to school and participate as members of the community. Colín, now 31 years old and the political director of immigrant rights group CHIRLA and CHIRLA Action Fund, is focused on ensuring that other immigrants and Latinos get the chance to participate in the political process. Even 100 years after the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, accessing that right has not been easy for many Latina or immigrant women. Colín has seen countless women in her community struggle to navigate the electoral process. Some do not speak English and some do not read Spanish. She remembers the time an elderly woman came into the office saying she wanted to vote and asking if Colín could walk her through the process and help her fill out her ballot. Colín quickly realized the ballot was from the last election. She drove the woman to her polling station, which the woman didn’t know existed, and when no poll workers could speak Spanish in the predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhood, Colín translated and explained that the woman would not have to show her ID after she was asked to. Colín also works to ensure Latina and immigrant women see the importance of voting — something many candidates and campaigns fail to illustrate. While working on political campaigns, she noticed that candidates tend to focus on high-propensity voters, who are usually older and white, neglecting Latino and naturalized U.S. citizens. “We weren’t talking to my community, we weren’t talking to folks in Spanish, we weren’t talking to Latino or immigrant voters,” Colín said. “I knew that was the work I wanted to do.” With CHIRLA, Colín drove up and down the state of California, focusing on building congressional support for immigration reform and reviewing such legislation with members of her community. “Candidates need to really take Latino and immigrant voters seriously,” Colín said. “They have to be taken into consideration beyond 30 days before an election or two months before an election.” “You know, we’ve been saying this for a long time,” she said. “The road to the White House, the road to Congress, the road to your state legislature goes through the Latino vote.” . . “Certain people here are like, ‘No, voter suppression doesn’t exist here.’ While they might not be saying ‘You can’t vote because of this, this and this,’ your actions really say the same thing.” JAZLYN CRAWFORD, ATLANTA, GEORGIA . . Jazlyn Crawford, Atlanta, Georgia WRITTEN BY JAMIE FELDMAN In November 2018, Jazlyn Crawford was getting ready to vote in her first election. A sophomore at Spelman College in Atlanta, she changed her voter registration from her home state of Pennsylvania to Georgia in order to vote in the gubernatorial contest between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp. It took until the day before the election for Crawford, an international studies major, to receive notice that the registration change had gone through. She took the confirmation letter to the polls, where she stood in a long line and watched multiple people be turned away. When she got to the front of the line, she was nearly turned away herself. The polling worker told Crawford he couldn’t find her name, then pushed back when she requested a provisional ballot. “He told me there were several people requesting provisional ballots and only two left, so how fair would it be to give me one and not someone else?” she said. “I told him it would be fair and within my rights as a voter — and asked him to check for my name again.” Following the exchange, Crawford says the worker was able to find her name and allowed her to vote the regular way. But the experience was still illuminating: She saw how difficult it was not only for her but many people to wait in long lines, deal with faulty machines and, in certain cases, get turned away entirely. The governor’s race was so fraught with stories of voter suppression all over the state that Abrams vowed to fight the policies in place that contributed to her ultimately close defeat. Crawford realized that a lot of things people simply don’t know make voting and getting politically involved even more difficult. Since then, she has worked hard to make sure her vote is counted this time — in her first presidential election — and also that everyone around her gets out there, too. She now works with organizations in both Pennsylvania and Georgia to spread accessible information and assist with all aspects of the voting experience. “Right now I’m not exactly going door to door,” she said. “But I’m digitally working with people to figure out how to navigate this process. Now with the coronavirus, it’s just figuring out what voting looks like, making sure I’m educating myself on what to do and how to do it safely.” Crawford works with fellow college students to navigate voting, which is more complicated if they’re away from home. She noted that some voting forms for mail-in ballots can be denied if the applicant lists a P.O. box for their address, for example. She has also met with politicians — including Spelman sister Abrams — to work to dismantle voter suppression in Georgia and beyond. “Certain people here are like, ‘No, voter suppression doesn’t exist here,’” Crawford said. “While they might not be saying, ‘You can’t vote because of this, this and this,’ your actions really say the same thing. I’ve been working to point out where there is suppression that makes it harder for people to exercise their right.” Crawford says she is really excited to vote in November and to see what is going to happen, and encourages anyone with questions to reach out to her on her social media platforms. “My message to people ahead of the election is to do everything you can in your power to make sure your voice is heard, continue to be, as Shirley Chisholm once said, ‘unbossed and unbought’ and to get out there. That’s all we can do at this point.” And while an interest in politics comes naturally to Crawford — her aunt is Georgia state Sen. Nikema Willams (D) and her parents both work in politics — she tries to pull in others’ interests by using contemporary examples, like quoting “Real Housewives of Atlanta” to explain foreign policy. “It seems really silly at first, but whatever it takes to get people to understand the current state of the country is what it’s going to take, and people are actually involved that way,” Crawford said.  Chanel Haley, Atlanta, Georgia WRITTEN BY ALANNA VAGIANOS One of Chanel Haley’s most formative memories is watching her mother volunteer to help elect Maureen O’Connor, the first female mayor of San Diego, in 1985. “I thought, hey, if a Black single mother who had me when she was 14 could take time out to volunteer for a woman to be elected for the first time in our city,” then she could as well, she said. After Haley transitioned at 18, she began to work in civic engagement. “Certainly in my 20s, after transitioning and seeing how I and other transwomen of color were being treated, I should definitely be caring about politics, too,” she said. Now 40 and living outside of Atlanta, Haley has spent the past two decades fighting for the rights of Black, transgender and gender-nonconfoming people, among others. She helped elect Simone Bell, the first openly gay Black woman to win a general assembly seat in the country, in 2009. Haley later served as Bell’s senior legislative aide and became the first Black trans person to be hired by the Georgia House. In 2014, Haley was appointed to the City of Atlanta Human Relations Commission, becoming the first trans person to chair an Atlanta city board. She is currently a delegate in the upcoming Democratic National Convention. Now, Haley serves as the gender policy manager for Equality Foundation of Georgia, working, among other things, on expanding voting access for trans and genderqueer people. “It’s so important that the trans community speak up and come out of the shadows when it’s safe for them to do so, and be able to vote on issues that affect them directly,” Haley said. Trans and gender-nonconforming people face unique obstacles to voting due to federal voter registration requirements and strict voter ID laws that vary by state. Many of these laws, allegedly intended to stop voter fraud, actually hinder transgender people from voting because they require identification documents to match a person’s gender. Oftentimes, licenses and passports reflect the gender assigned to a person at birth rather than their authentic gender identity. If identification documents don’t show a person’s current name, polling officials are legally allowed to turn them away at the ballot box, as long as they are given a provisional ballot and the opportunity to later prove their identity. In practice, voting rights experts say, poll workers don’t always follow the law. One million transgender people are eligible to vote, but nearly 380,000 do not have IDs that match their correct name and gender, according to the Williams Institute. More than 81,000 live in states with strict photo ID requirements for voting, and a disproportionate number are trans people of color. People of all different gender identities, as well as different racial, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, must come together to fight for transgender and genderqueer voting rights, Haley said. “Because when one person’s rights are taken away, it opens the door for the next group of people’s rights to be taken away,” she said. “What I want people to really understand about me is that yes, I am a Black trans woman living in the South and I’ve done all these things, but my allegiance is with equality,” Haley added. “Everything that I do — whether I’m getting paid for it or doing it for free — it’s because I believe in equality, equality for everybody.” And as Americans mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, Haley wants candidates — particularly Democrats — to remember the women that amendment excluded. “It’s like an oxymoron,” Haley said of the 19th Amendment, because it only applied to white women. “We do know that for a Democrat to be elected to the White House they need the Black female vote,” she said. “The requirement of Black women to vote in the election and reelection of Democrats is obvious, and yet what is given back to the community is usually lackluster.” CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this article stated that poll workers are legally allowed to turn people away from the ballot box if the gender marker on their ID does not match how they present at the poll. While poll workers can turn people away for this reason, they are legally required to give the voter a provisional ballot. . . “I’m going to keep trying to encourage people to have their voice heard as loud and as much as they can and encourage people to do what is right.” HANA OMAR, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA . . Hana Omar, Indianapolis, Indiana WRITTEN BY ROWAIDA ABDELAZIZ Hana Omar, now 27, came to the U.S. with her two brothers, sister and mother in 2014 as a refugee from Somalia. Two years later, her new country elected President Donald Trump, who quickly set out to exclude more people like Omar and her family from the country by enacting a travel ban and weakening the refugee resettlement system. At the time, Omar couldn’t stop it. She wasn’t eligible to vote. But she vowed that once she gained her U.S. citizenship, she would use her new rights and encourage others to do the same. After the coronavirus postponed their initial citizenship appointment set for March, Omar and her siblings – in their masks and practicing social distancing – took their oath in June and were officially naturalized as American citizens. That same day, Omar registered to vote. “I’m very excited and proud to be here and to be able to vote and have my voice heard,” she said. “This country keeps on evolving and it’s very nice to be part of it.” A student at Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis studying dental hygiene, Omar is using her free time to learn about the American electoral process and discuss politics with her family, friends and co-workers. The office where she works as a dental assistant plans to close on Election Day in November to encourage its staff and clients to vote. Omar has noticed that some new citizens refrain from voting because they feel they don’t know enough and often are overlooked by politicians. Refugees and new U.S. citizens, especially those who are not fluent in English, are often intimidated by the voting process, don’t have basic information such as election dates and locations, and therefore choose to sit out. Refugees from countries where the political and voting systems are corrupt might also experience hesitation and confusion about the U.S. voting system. Misconceptions and the lack of outreach to dismantle them can further isolate new Americans and discourage them from partaking in the voting process. “People who just got their citizenships often feel like it’s not their place to vote or try to make a change,” Omar told HuffPost. “They feel because they’re new here, they should just take a step back and watch everything and not get involved.” Omar urges community members to take part in elections and vote for people who will “hear you out and understand where you’re coming from” and for those “who represent us, [have] been through our experiences or at least understand them.” Omar is dismayed that some U.S. citizens don’t vote. She said if they won’t vote for themselves, they should vote for people like her and her family who could be affected by harmful policies. She said the recent anti-racism protests, the coronavirus pandemic and the rise of hate against Muslims and other minorities “is so unfair and it’s hard to watch every day on the news. So, if that’s not enough to push everyone to vote, I don’t know what it is.” “I’m going to keep trying to encourage people to have their voice heard as loud and as much as they can and encourage people to do what is right,” she added. . . “There are so many existential threats we’re all going through as a country right now, and ensuring that people have access to the ballot in November is key. It has to be.” NICOLE D. PORTER, WASHINGTON, D.C. . . Nicole D. Porter, Washington, D.C. WRITTEN BY JENAVIEVE HATCH Nicole D. Porter has spent the past two decades committed to reforming the criminal justice system. She’s monitored conditions in detention and advocated against mass incarceration as part of the Texas ACLU, as the director of the Prison and Jail Accountability Project, and for the last eight years, as director of advocacy for The Sentencing Project. Porter has worked to expand voting rights denied to millions of people based on their past felony convictions, preventing them from participating in democracy even after they’ve done their time. And she has made sure that incarcerated people who are eligible to vote can actually do so. Voting, in particular, has always been a key issue for Porter, a Houston native. She was politically engaged in high school and excited to vote in her first election. In college, she joined the Young Democrats (though she no longer identifies as such), and one of her first forays into activism was manning the voter registration table on her college campus in Baltimore. “Voting has always been a key issue for me,” Porter said. “I’ve always been personally excited about it, and it’s always been an avenue for me to engage my activism and civic participation.” Through her work, Porter has seen how much felony disenfranchisement affects Americans’ lives. As the number of incarcerated people in the United States has risen so significantly over the last 30 years, so too has the country’s population of disenfranchised citizens. As of 2016, an estimated 6 million Americans were unable to vote because of a felony conviction; half of those people are disenfranchised because of harsh state laws that restrict voting rights once sentences are completed. And because Black people and other people of color are so unjustly targeted by the American criminal justice system, they are also hit the hardest when it comes to disenfranchisement. One in every 13 Black Americans has lost their right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement — that’s 2.2 million Black citizens across the country, which shouldn’t come as a huge surprise considering the racist roots of disenfranchisement, especially in Southern states. And of that national number, about 20% of those disenfranchised people are women. In recent years, several states have taken great strides to expand voting rights — and that’s due to the committed work of advocates like Porter who work on both a federal and state level to push for such reforms. Last year, Colorado restored voting rights to parolees, and Kentucky restored voting rights to formerly incarcerated people convicted of nonviolent felonies. In 2016, California restored voting rights to people convicted of a felony offense housed in jail, but not in prison. Beyond expanding the franchise to people with felony convictions, Porter’s urgent work this year has centered around the coronavirus pandemic — getting people out of prisons is a priority, she said, especially after public health experts correctly warned last spring that detention facilities would be fertile ground for an outbreak. But it’s also an extremely important election year, and fighting for voting rights for those incarcerated people is a key priority, too. “There are so many existential threats we’re all going through as a country right now, and ensuring that people have access to the ballot in November is key. It has to be,” Porter said. Porter and The Sentencing Project at large are working to support voter registration efforts for people in jails and prisons, but because of COVID-19, that work is now extra challenging since jails and prisons aren’t allowing anyone inside for public health purposes. And as the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment approaches during such a huge election year, Porter’s work in expanding voting rights to all citizens is as urgent as ever. “There’s a long history in the United States of excluded groups fighting [for] and seeking their access to the franchise of voting,” she said. “Expanding the vote to people with felony convictions is an extension of that history, and an extension of disenfranchised residents claiming their full civil and political rights.” Credits: Editors: Elise Foley, Mari Hayman and Richard Kim; Reporters: Emma Gray, Alanna Vagianos, Rowaida Abdelaziz, Jamie Feldman, Taryn Finley, Jenavieve Hatch and Brooklyn Wayland; Creative Director: Ivylise Simones; Photo Director: Christy Havranek; Art Director: Isabella Carapella; Photo Editor: Damon Scheleur"
11,Yemeni National Granted Asylum After HuffPost Report,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost After trekking across several countries, languishing for over nine months in U.S. immigration custody, and then being denied protection from deportation, Yemeni national Osamah Mahyoub was granted asylum this week. Immigration officials are set to release Mahyoub from Adams County Detention Center in Mississippi on Wednesday. It’s a triumph for Mahyoub, who was initially denied protection by immigration officials and faced deportation back to Yemen alongside Yemeni national Emad Al-Azabi. HuffPost published an investigation in May into their cases and long-term detention. “Winning Osamah’s case was a true victory because he has endured a lot of pain and grief in his life in his home country of Yemen. He lost almost everything before fleeing to the United States,” Assma Ali, Mahyoub’s lawyer, told HuffPost. “Now, he has another opportunity to live a life free of fear, intimidation, and violence,” Ali added. “Justice was served in this case, and cases like this give us hope that justice prevails at the end of the day.” Mahyoub’s case demonstrated how difficult and fickle the U.S. immigration system can be, particularly under President Donald Trump, whose administration has made consistent efforts to limit asylum protections. But unlike many asylum-seekers, Mahyoub ultimately prevailed. He is set to fly to New York this week to join Al-Azabi, who was released in early June but is still waiting to be granted asylum. Mahyoub and Al-Azabi fled Yemen due to threats on their lives by the local armed rebel group there and journeyed across eight Latin American countries to get to the United States. ICE detained them in November 2019. U.S. officials initially determined that Mahyoub and Al-Azabi did not qualify for asylum because they did not have a “credible fear,” or a reason to fear persecution or torture in their home country. After HuffPost’s initial story about their plight, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted both men new interviews. A few days later, USCIS reversed its decision and noted that both men did indeed have a credible fear. Al-Azabi was then released on bond later that month. Mahyoub and Al-Azabi noted that they were each asked extensive questions about HuffPost’s report during their new credible fear interviews. Both men and their lawyers believe public attention may have played a role in USCIS’s reversal of its initial decisions. USCIS told HuffPost it did not comment on individual cases. “I can’t explain how I feel. I am just so happy, especially after having faced such danger against my life. But now, I found out that justice does exist in the United States,” said Al-Azabi, who is in the midst of his own immigration proceedings. He said he is hopeful that he will also be granted asylum.

12,More Immigrants Have Died In ICE Custody This Year Than Every Year Since 2006,social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost Two immigrants died in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, bringing the death toll so far this year to 17 ― the highest since 2006. 51-year-old Kuan Hui Lee died Wednesday of “massive intercranial hemorrhage” at the Kendall Regional Medical Center in Miami, a week after officers at ICE’s Krome Processing Center found him unresponsive, the agency said. Lee, originally from Taiwan, had been in ICE custody for more than six months, according to the press release. U.S. Border Patrol officers arrested him on Jan. 23 for overstaying his temporary visa, which expired in 2004, ICE said. Separately Wednesday, James Thomas Hill, a 72-year-old Canadian at the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia, also died, an ICE spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost. The spokesperson declined to specify a cause of death, though noted in an emailed release that Hill had tested positive for COVID-19. Hill was hospitalized on July 10 after reporting shortness of breath. At least three migrants are confirmed to have died from COVID-19 while in ICE custody, not counting the suspected coronavirus death of Hill on Wednesday. Farmville has 290 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the second-highest of all ICE facilities. There are currently 917 confirmed positive cases in the system overall ― and that’s almost assuredly an undercount. Emails obtained by The Los Angeles Times last month show ICE has deliberately limited COVID-19 testing in at least one California facility. Staff there feared it would be too difficult to quarantine those who tested positive, so they pushed back on carrying out the tests. “ICE disregards the safety and wellbeing of people in its custody resulting in deadly consequences,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, in an emailed statement to HuffPost. “Despite countless calls to free people from detention amid the rising rates of COVID-19 infection, ICE has done nothing — ICE is complicit in this loss of life. Now, more than ever, we see the importance of ending this arbitrary and inhumane system of detention.” COVID-19 has compounded problems with ICE’s approach to medical care, which in general is “indifferent at best,” a 2019 Politico report found, beginning with inadequate records management. The report, which reviewed immigrant deaths in ICE custody from 2013 through 2018, “revealed malfunctioning software and troubling gaps in use of technology, such as failure to properly document patient care or scribbling documentation in the margins of forms.” Together, the 2020 deaths are more than double the total from 2019 for the U.S. government’s fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Eight people died while in immigrant detention last year, according to data tracked by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

14,Progressive St. Louis Prosecutor Targeted By Trump Fends Off Democratic Challenger,social-justice," Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Top St. Louis prosecutor Kim Gardner, the city’s first Black circuit attorney, defeated a former city homicide prosecutor in her Democratic primary race on Tuesday, all but ensuring her reelection in the general election this fall. Gardner received over 60% of the vote — more than 43,000 votes, compared to challenger Mary Pat Carl’s 28,000. The incumbent St. Louis circuit attorney deflected a Democratic primary challenge from Carl, a former assistant circuit attorney who was among a wave of St. Louis prosecutors who departed after Gardner’s election. Carl’s campaign focused on violent crime and Gardner’s lower conviction rate, but she also said she’d take a “smart on crime” approach to her job and divert cases from the criminal justice system when possible. Gardner, 44, first came to office in 2016 along with a wave of progressive prosecutors who sought to break from “law and order” politics and rethink the role of prosecutors in the United States, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world, even as jail and prison populations have contracted in recent years. She quickly became a target of controversy, including for her decision to charge former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) with felony invasion of privacy in connection with a photo he snapped of a woman during an extramarital affair, as well as for her list of St. Louis Metropolitan Police officers whose testimony her office wouldn’t rely upon because of integrity concerns. The St. Louis circuit attorney more recently grabbed national headlines when she charged a white couple who pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters marching past their home, a decision that came under criticism from President Donald Trump. Gardner said the couple could participate in a diversion program that would resolve the case, but the charges garnered attention from Republican politicians on the state and national level who said they infringed upon the couple’s Second Amendment rights. Trump’s press secretary said the president considered the case an “egregious abuse of power,” while Missouri’s Republican governor said the president would like to get involved in the case. The couple, personal injury attorneys Mark McCloskey and Patricia McCloskey, starred in a Trump campaign video. Gardner said the attacks from the president inspired a wave of racist hate against her, calling the campaign against her “a modern-day night ride” in an interview with The Washington Post. Earlier this year, Gardner filed suit against the city of St. Louis for its opposition to her reforms, using a provision of the law known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. The complaint alleged the city — along with its infamous local police union — was conducting “a racially-motivated conspiracy to deny the civil rights of racial minorities by obstructing a government official’s efforts to ensure equal justice under law for all.” In her 2016 race, Gardner had the backing of some activists who rose to prominence in the 2014 unrest in nearby Ferguson, which brought national attention to criminal justice issues and laid the foundation for the broader movement that swept the nation after the killing of George Floyd in May. Like many progressive prosecutors in primary races across the nation, Gardner also received a boost both in 2016 and in 2020 from a PAC funded by liberal billionaire George Soros, an 89-year-old major funder of progressive causes who frequently draws scrutiny from conservatives. After Trump’s attack on Gardner, a number of current and former elected prosecutors came to her defense, writing a letter calling for an end to the “hateful and dangerous” attacks on an elected official as she carried out the duties she was elected to perform. Miriam Krinsky, executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, which helped organize the letter, said that Gardner had come under “incredibly aggressive and divisive” attacks during her first term as she dealt with high turnover in her office from prosecutors used to the status quo. “Those challenges run deep, and changing institutions that have done things one way for a long time doesn’t happen overnight,” Krinsky said. Other key prosecutors races on Tuesday, as highlighted by the criminal justice website The Appeal, include a primary in Pima County, Arizona, a primary in Maricopa County, Arizona, a race in Wayne County, Michigan, and a race in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Krinsky said that even as Trump and Attorney General William Barr ―who spoke out against progressive district attorneys even as a reform-minded prosecutor was elected in Barr’s own home county in Virginia last year ― have engaged in “tough on crime” rhetoric, many Americans are open to rethinking how they want to approach crime. “We’ve seen with each passing election a growing number of candidates calling for a reset of the justice system,” Krinsky said. “It’s a wave that started in 2016, and with each new election more and more voters have come to understand the impact of these elections and have made choices to move away from past ‘tough-on-crime’ approaches that have failed.” Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Racist Couple Suspected Of Vandalizing Black Man's Truck Charged With Hate Crime,social-justice," National Reporter, HuffPost A white couple filmed shouting racist epithets and hitting the truck of a Black man in California last month have been arrested on hate crime and vandalism charges. Gregory and Rachel Howell, both 29, were arrested by police in Torrance, California, on Friday, just over a week after video featuring the two harassing Itzel Lopez and her boyfriend, who is Black, went viral. The footage filmed by Lopez shows the Howells exit their pickup truck while both couples were stopped at a red light in the Los Angeles metro area on the night of July 22. Rachel approaches Lopez’s side of the vehicle and, raising dual middle fingers, shouts, “White lives matter, bitch!” She then repeats, “Only white lives matter, bitch!” On the other side of the vehicle, Gregory throws a Nazi salute and says, “White power,” prompting Lopez and her boyfriend to erupt in disbelieving laughter. “Crazy. The shit we have to go through in 2020,” Lopez remarks on the video. The Howells then briefly return to their truck, where Gregory retrieves a shovel. He turns back to the other vehicle and slams the shovel into the driver’s side as Lopez’s boyfriend backs up and drives away ― carefully avoiding Rachel, who Lopez said kept moving to block their path. Lopez, 25, told KTLA that she and her boyfriend were on their way home from her birthday dinner when the other truck appeared to follow them, tailing them for several miles. “It really threw me off,” she told the local station. “Never in my life did I think I was gonna experience this,” she said. “It’s actually really scary. They don’t even know you and they’re willing to hurt you. It’s sad.” A second video shared by Lopez shows the couple identifying the Howells’ license plate, which they then provided to police.

0,"For Ben & Jerry's, It's Never Been Just About The Ice Cream",social-justice," On Assignment For HuffPost On June 2, while many other brands in the United States were posting a black square to their social media accounts and making carefully worded statements about racism in the wake of George Floyd’s death, Ben & Jerry’s had a much more direct message. The ice cream company tweeted an image that in bold letters read: “WE MUST DISMANTLE WHITE SUPREMACY.” Among the flood of bland and empty corporate platitudes, the post stood out. It was no viral fluke, but the product of decades of brand development around social activism. “We use all the tools we have to sell ice cream and put them in service of grassroots activists,” said Chris Miller, the corporate activism manager for Ben & Jerry’s ― a rare position in corporate America. Too often, corporate efforts to speak out about racism are vague or clumsy, dismissed by many as “woke-washing” ― that is, speaking out for fear of losing customers and profits rather than from a genuine desire to push social change. In some cases, people in outright anger have pointed to the huge disconnect between these newly proclaimed commitments to anti-racist policies and companies’ histories of low wages, discrimination and dangerous work conditions. But Ben & Jerry’s didn’t mince words. The murder of George Floyd was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy. https://t.co/YppGJKHkyN pic.twitter.com/YABzgQMf69 “The murder of George Floyd was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy,” reads a longer statement on its website. “What happened to George Floyd was not the result of a bad apple; it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated Black bodies as the enemy from the beginning.” From same-sex marriage to criminal justice reform to campaign finance, Ben & Jerry’s has taken a stance on nearly every major social issue of the last three decades. It’s also tried to reflect those values internally — to varying degrees of success — by sourcing ethical products throughout its supply chain and paying Vermont employees a liveable hourly wage. By its own admission, the ice cream brand has more work to do to live up to its promises. But it bucks the corporate trend with a business model that treats its product as a way to create progressive change, not just generate profit. “I think Ben & Jerry’s is probably the most prominent ... for-profit corporation that has such an active and strong stance on racial justice,” said Stephanie Creary, an assistant professor of management specializing in identity and diversity at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “They set the bar really high, that’s the reality.” As other companies struggle to convince consumers of their commitment to progressive issues, Ben & Jerry’s track record means that when it says it wants to upend white supremacy, customers generally believe it. When co-founders and childhood friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield started Ben & Jerry’s out of a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, they just wanted to make good ice cream. But over the next decade, they began to feel that the company should try to have a positive impact beyond its product. In 1988, they wrote their first mission statement. “It said that the social mission was about using the power of business to address social and environmental issues. Or something like that!” Greenfield told HuffPost. But they quickly realized that what they’d come up with was too vague to be effective. “There needed to be more specificity,” said Greenfield. They regrouped and landed on a new focus: They would prioritize progressive values, especially equality and sustainability. The company took up its first political issue not long after: protesting the billions of dollars the Reagan administration was spending on nuclear weapons while 1 in 5 children in America was living in poverty. “It’s a matter of getting up and being who you are every day, and when you live by your values, that’s just what you do.” At the time, Cohen and Greenfield had been developing a chocolate-covered ice cream bar. Cohen proposed using its wrapper to lay out demands that the federal government shift 1% of its defense budget toward peace-promoting projects. And so, in 1988 the “Peace Pop” was born ― the first time Ben & Jerry’s had linked its product with activism. The move was controversial. Some staff worried that consumers would see the brand as “unpatriotic” for condemning government policy and boycott the ice cream. “Ben pretty much put his foot down and said, ‘This is what the company is about,’” Greenfield recalled. “We came out with the product, and none of those bad things happened.” The idea that a business would take a public stance on social issues was unusual in the late ’80s and early ’90s. Companies were beginning to speak out about climate change, reassuring customers — sometimes deceptively — that their products and services were environmentally friendly. But business owners did not tend to be vocal about issues that were not seen as directly related to their operations. When Cohen and Greenfield sat on panels and visited business schools to talk about their company, some of their counterparts advised them against supporting “controversial” issues, telling them it would hurt their bottom line. But 30 years on from the Peace Pop, Ben & Jerry’s is still doing just fine, mixing its ongoing activism with a thriving business. Politically and provocatively named products like “Justice ReMix’d,” a flavor the company developed to promote criminal justice reform, and “Pecan Resist,” a flavor supporting anti-Trump activism, have become the company’s signature, something its customers have come to expect. “To me, Ben & Jerry’s are basically activists who happen to sell ice cream,” said Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of Business. “When people say, ‘I’m a Ben & Jerry’s customer,’ they’re not just saying, ‘I like the ice cream’ ― they’re saying, ‘I believe in those values.’” The ice cream brand made $681.5 million in revenue last year, from hundreds of storefronts across the country and supermarket sales of pints and bars. Cohen and Greenfield are no longer involved in managing the business. Cohen, the company’s first CEO (and the only one of the two founders to hold that position), stepped down in 1994. In 2000, the duo sold their company to Unilever ― a move approved by Ben & Jerry’s board despite Cohen admitting at the time that he would have preferred the company to stay independent. The sale sparked accusations that they had sold out. But despite being acquired by a multinational multibillion-dollar conglomerate, Ben & Jerry’s fought to maintain its progressive reputation. The company’s acquisition agreement even included a requirement that Ben & Jerry’s spend at least $1.1 million a year on its activism. Since then, a department has been created within the company dedicated to advancing social justice causes. The team is helmed by Miller, whose background, like that of many of the employees he supervises, is heavy on policy and advocacy. Before joining Ben & Jerry’s over six years ago, he worked for then-Vermont Rep. Bernie Sanders and Greenpeace USA. Rather than just hand out one-time large-dollar donations, as corporations often do in their efforts to demonstrate a commitment to social justice, Miller’s team also develops long-term partnerships with grassroots organizations, using the company’s corporate muscle to amplify their activism. “We do make donations to support our groups,” Miller said, “but we’re also experts at framing, communication, buying media, using digital, and running social channels.” The company’s focus on racial inequality and criminal justice reform is partly a reaction to its own lack of diversity — like Vermont, its corporate office is roughly 95% white, though its scoop shops are more diverse — as well as an acknowledgment of the different experiences that white and Black Americans have, said Miller. Last year, the Advancement Project National Office ― a civil rights group that matches national partners with small grassroots organizations ― paired Ben & Jerry’s with Close the Workhouse, a campaign against a St. Louis jail known as the Workhouse, where 90% of the population is Black and the vast majority are unable to leave pending trial simply because they cannot afford to post bail. Inez Bordeaux, an activist and member of the organizing team for Close the Workhouse, said they decided to work with the company because of its “activist footprint.” She was surprised at Ben & Jerry’s earnest and humble approach. “[Ben & Jerry’s] never came in and tried to say, ‘We think you should do it this way.’ They came in and said, ‘What are you working on? How can we support you?’” she said. “You don’t run into many people like that — you don’t run into many major ... corporations like that.” When the campaign was organizing around a direct action — like urging St. Louis residents to call their representatives in advance of a budget hearing — a team of about a dozen Ben & Jerry’s employees would help spread the word on social media channels. In June 2019, Cohen visited St. Louis to give a press conference at City Hall, urging the mayor to close the jail. The publicity helped, according to Bordeaux: On July 17 of this year, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen unanimously passed a bill to close down the Workhouse by the end of 2020. The success belonged to the activists whose “pressure was already pretty high,” Bordeaux said. “But to then have Ben & Jerry’s come to your city and call out the mayor ... it really helped give the campaign more leverage.” Ben & Jerry’s has tried to ensure that the values it promotes publicly extend to its own workforce. The company starts its entry-level Vermont employees at $18.13 an hour ― $7.17 above the state’s minimum wage ― and allows workers to take home three pints of ice cream at the end of every workday. The company also stopped including criminal background checks in the first stage of its application process in 2015, in solidarity with a national campaign to remove the check box that typically appears on job applications asking about applicants’ criminal history. “As far as capitalism goes, they’re doing a pretty good job.” Ben & Jerry’s also formalized the idea of putting social and environmental impact on a par with profit-making when it became a B Corporation in 2012: a nonprofit certification that requires a company to show that it creates value for all those it deals with, not just its investors. “Ben & Jerry’s first stood out as one of the pioneers of embedding social purpose in their business,” said Veena Harbaugh, the director of marketing for B Lab U.S. & Canada. “Now within a community of thousands of B Corps, they stand out for the breadth and depth of their positive impact ... leading collective action groups, and helping businesses wake up to their responsibility in creating racial justice.” Part of being a B Corp means verifying that the companies Ben & Jerry’s works with have similar standards. Greyston Bakery, the business that makes the brownies that go into its ice cream, also forgoes background checks as well as interviews, résumés and applications in order to create more hiring opportunities for people who experience barriers to employment. Anyone interested in a job at Greyston must visit the bakery in person to get their name put on a hiring list; when there’s an opening, Greyston calls the person whose name is next on the list and offers them the position “no questions asked.” After learning that most Americans don’t have enough savings to cover a $500 emergency, Rhino Foods — Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough supplier — created an income advance program, effectively an internal loan system, for its employees. The ice cream brand calls this way of doing business “linked prosperity” — the idea that there should be a positive impact on everyone in its supply chain, from employees to suppliers to customers and anyone else affected by its production process. “Ben & Jerry’s is a pretty equitable enactment of capitalism,” said Emily Barman, a professor of sociology specializing in philanthropy at Boston University, and the author of “Caring Capitalism.” “They have a reputation for treating their employees and consumers well. As far as capitalism goes, they’re doing a pretty good job.” Despite these raves, Ben & Jerry’s hasn’t completely escaped controversy. The company’s Black Lives Matter statement last month reignited old criticisms about its operations in Israel, where Ben & Jerry’s has a factory and two scoop shops. A pro-Palestine group in Vermont called the ice cream brand hypocritical for making money from ice cream sold in disputed Israeli settlements. “We are keenly aware of how complex the local market can be,” a Ben & Jerry’s spokesperson told HuffPost, clarifying that the manufacturing facility and two scoop shops are located outside the occupied territories. Ben & Jerry’s has also seen criticism about the practices of some of its suppliers. In 2015, migrant workers from Vermont dairy farms protested outside Ben & Jerry’s flagship Burlington store as part of a state-wide campaign to raise dairy industry standards. They asked that the company require its own milk suppliers to provide workers with vacation time, expanded time off and other benefits, which would hopefully persuade other companies to do the same. Ben & Jerry’s didn’t agree to the workers’ demands until 2017. “It took years of convincing,” Marita Canedo, a grassroots organizer for the Milk With Dignity initiative, told Vermont Public Radio last month. Ben & Jerry’s said work was going on behind closed doors during that time. “In the end, we became the first — and, we believe, still the only — dairy buyer to commit to Milk With Dignity. We’ve worked hard to make it a success and we are proud of the real changes it has led to,” a Ben & Jerry’s spokesperson told HuffPost. Other critics have noted an exception to Ben & Jerry’s livable wage program: It does not apply to employees at the company’s many scoop shop franchises, where hourly wages and benefits are subject to state laws and the decisions of individual owners. Commenting on this, a Ben & Jerry’s spokesperson said: “The vast majority of our franchisees are incredibly caring for their staff as they know the staff members are the front line and create the customer experience. The scoopers often work a shorter workday for only one or two days per week in comparison to our manufacturing team.” The journey hasn’t always been smooth, Greenfield admits. Ambitious policies adopted by Ben & Jerry’s were sometimes later abandoned ― such as when it had to scrap its salary compression policy (requiring that executive pay never be more than five times that of the lowest-paid worker) in order to find a CEO with more experience in running a business after Cohen stepped down. And despite the positive clauses in the Unilever contract, the company went through some growing pains after the acquisition, including layoffs and some initial resistance to the company’s brand of activism. Through it all, Ben & Jerry’s leadership never expected the ice cream company to be the vanguard of social change. But thinking back to 1978, when he and Cohen started the business, Greenfield sees a company with a social justice mission that was ahead of its time. And 40 years on, many other companies are still trying to catch up — including Unilever, which began to take its own social responsibility more seriously after buying Ben & Jerry’s. “If companies are trying to understand how not to be lambasted for just creating a statement and not following up, if they’re really trying to look for how far they could actually go ... I think [Ben & Jerry’s] is a good place to look,” said Creary. Reed agreed: “They are kind of the gold standard in this area.” He added, “It’s a matter of getting up and being who you are every day, and when you live by your values, that’s just what you do.” When Greenfield saw Ben & Jerry’s Black Lives Matter statement during the wave of protests that followed Floyd’s death, he felt that the essential spirit of the company was still alive. “Ben set the company on a path that allowed it to ... feel comfortable speaking out about controversial issues,” Greenfield said. “We supported Black Lives Matter four years ago when no businesses would go near it.” “There have been times in Ben & Jerry’s history, after Unilever purchased the company, when it wasn’t working, and I’m happy to say things are working well [now],” Greenfield said. “When I see the company come out with a statement on dismantling white supremacy, I’m just so proud.” HuffPost’s “Work In Progress” series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by Porticus.

1,Tucker Carlson Accuses 'Greasy Politician' Obama Of 'Desecrating A Funeral',social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Thursday attacked former President Barack Obama for his eulogy to civil rights icon John Lewis, the longtime Georgia congressman who died earlier this month at the age of 80. Carlson began by attacking the Black Lives Matter movement and telling viewers that the “professional left” is “not like you at all.” “Their first instinct is to manipulate rather than persuade. They hide their real beliefs,” he said. “They say precisely the opposite of what they mean every time. They accuse you of the crimes they themselves are committing.” He said they “don’t believe in the existence of truth,” and he used Obama’s speech at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta as “evidence.” Obama, in his eulogy to his friend and idol, said the best way to honor Lewis would be action on voting rights, one of the Democratic congressman’s core issues and a cause he risked his life to advance. “If you want to honor John, let’s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for,” Obama said. He also called for an end to gerrymandering, often done to disenfranchise Black voters, as well as the filibuster, which he called a Jim Crow-era relic. But Carlson called Obama’s eulogy “a divisive and deeply dishonest campaign speech.” “It’s hard to believe that clip is real, but it is, down to the cloying fake accent, Mr. Hawaii Guy,” Carlson said, adding: “Imagine if some greasy politician showed up at your loved one’s funeral and started throwing around stupid partisan talking points about Senate procedure. Can you imagine that? You would be shocked if that happened. You’d probably walk out. Desecrating a funeral with campaign slogans? What kind of person would do that?” See more of his comments below: Overnight Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,My Immigrant Parents Came To The U.S. For A Better Life. Here's Why I May Want To Leave.,social-justice," Guest writer More than 40 years ago, my father’s family fled the Vietnam War and came to America. He left behind his younger brother and my grandparents (they would take a separate journey), and settled in a refugee camp in the Midwest. He tells me that he would eat fish from the backwater creeks behind the camps ― fish that Americans would never touch, and though he got sick he continued to eat because food was food. Eventually the family moved to California and reunited under one roof. In those days, my father, his brothers and his grandmother slept together on one mattress ― they had fitful dreams, I’m sure. My father made his way to UCSD, and there, he met my mother who left Indonesia to attend college in America. A decade later they married. In the ’90s, on a winning combination of hard work and improbable good fortune, they rode the Silicon Valley wave to success. They bought a house, they bought a car, they became citizens, and were primed to pass on their victories to another generation. By all accounts, they fulfilled that great prophecy, the American Dream. I have to wonder if my parents, in today’s world, would have decided to come to America at all. Every hour Americans receive increasingly deranged news about a pandemic which has brought this country to its knees. Yet I see proof from other countries that it is possible to provide everyone proper PPE, monthly additional income for the duration of COVID-19, and free and accessible health care, and flatten the curve. It feels like a blunt metaphor that most of America’s wounds from the pandemic are self-inflicted. While we’re seeing record-breaking death counts well into July, abroad, they’re opening up restaurants, bookstores and movie theaters. A dark movie theater, a cold drink, the faint crunch of popcorn... such innocuous pleasures feel a world away. “Here, or so the dominant narrative goes, anyone can have it all. That’s the beautiful thing about this country. Most people would never dream that leaving America could be a good thing.” I consider myself extraordinarily privileged that I can even think of watching movies. I still have a place to live, I’m not in debt, and I have enough to pay for essentials. I have benefitted and continue to benefit in a million spoken and unspoken ways from my privilege. I am an American citizen, cisgender, a “model minority,” I and graduated from an expensive private university without student loans. I’m 23, healthy and live in New York which grants me access to incredible opportunities (if rent extortion). Yet with all my advantages, even before the pandemic, I found that I faced existential questions due to the poor policy priorities of this and past administrations. I’m privileged enough that I’m able to consider moving to another country as a viable option, and I’m able to write this very essay. My parents came from countries that don’t afford the same civic and human rights, social norms, job opportunities, or amenities we consider day-to-day essentials. When I tell my father that I’m thinking of moving to a different country, I’m met with shock and confusion. What was all that struggle for—all the years he was separated from his parents, the financial instability, the racism at school, and later, at work—if not to bring me up in the land of opportunity? I don’t know what it’s like to go hungry for days, or to not be able to (constantly) speak my mind. Here, or so the dominant narrative goes, anyone can have it all. That’s the beautiful thing about this country. Most people would never dream that leaving America could be a good thing. My mother, always four steps ahead, thinks it’s not such a bad idea. When I tell her I’d like to move to Montreal, she texts me: “Yeah with global warming, Canada is not such a bad place??” “The repetition of increasingly insurmountable and uniquely American failures makes me wonder the forbidden thing: if this country is beyond saving.” My parents have lived their whole lives as survivalists. Perhaps in one sense, they’ve passed that trait along to me; I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But it’s entirely possible that with all my privilege I’m blind to all that I have. Part of me wonders why I shouldn’t just stay here and keep fighting to make this country a better place. I could attend more protests. I could volunteer at asylum clinics. I could continue to vote, I could donate more to mutual-aid organizations, bail funds. I’ve done these things already, although not nearly enough. On the one hand, donating and helping in whatever small ways I can makes me feel better, more hopeful. On the other hand, the repetition of increasingly insurmountable and uniquely American failures makes me wonder the forbidden thing: if this country is beyond saving. Yes, other countries have similar legacies of racism, colonialism, inequality and violence. But it’s telling that the world is shocked by the way our police murder innocent Black people in cold blood. Our elected leaders are blatant in their preference to protect men’s right to guns over children’s lives. It’s absolutely insane that America, the richest country in the history of the world, has 4% of the world’s population, yet 25% of COVID-19 cases. Moreover, that infamous hustle, that “American spirit,” has translated into a grotesque capitalization on suffering. Right now, Wall Street vultures consider the uptick in evictions a “bonanza,” a “once-in-a-lifetime real estate opportunity.” Once in whose lifetime? “I don’t want to be here anymore. I realize I say this as a very lucky person. Yet with all my luck and privilege I don’t currently have health care.” I don’t want to be here anymore. I realize I say this as a very lucky person. Yet with all my luck and privilege I don’t currently have health care. My parents’ expectations are that as a grown adult I should be able to provide for myself, but with cheapest options available at $500 per month it feels like there’s no choice at all. I’m afraid that if I break an ankle or catch COVID-19 and discover underlying complications, I’ll have to drain my savings to save myself. I rent an apartment but I have no fantasies of owning property. I’ve invested in a 401k, but I have doubts it will be there or be enough by the time I need to use it. If I lose the gig that’s keeping me afloat, I’ll have to rely on unemployment. For now, that looks like an extra $600 per week on top of existing benefits, which is more than someone would make at a job that pays $15 per hour. I should note that as of today, that extra $600 is slated to end in two weeks, and Congress still has not made up its mind whether they’ll continue the program. I’m constantly subject to the arbitrary whims of a government that prioritizes Twitter tantrums over human lives. Being lucky in America means that there’s no safety net between me and the ground, even while sex traffickers, warmongers, pillagers, and rapists are shielded from impunity. Make it make sense. My family never fails to remind me that they came to America to make a better life for me. My story is not mine alone ― it’s the cornerstone of millions of first-generation Americans’ stories. My generation, however, is perhaps the first to see America in decline, crumbling right before our very eyes. More than a third of young adults in America believe there are better countries than the U.S. I’m one of them. “My family never fails to remind me that they came to America to make a better life for me. My story is not mine alone ― it’s the cornerstone of millions of first-generation Americans’ stories.” Yes, you can still find spectacular success in America, but living here is a gamble for which the price of losing is one’s life. For all of Trump’s efforts in trying to keep people out ― and let’s be honest, Trump is a symptom of the rot, not the rot itself ― there is little thought put into keeping people in. The deep irony of all of this is that most international borders are now closed to Americans. When they open back up, I think I’ll have my eyes set on somewhere else. I want to go somewhere where health care is considered a right, not a privilege, and where a gun isn’t considered more valuable than a human life. Somewhere where my freedom isn’t predicated on how much money I can funnel into the economy. Where true justice doesn’t feel improbable, even impossible. By leaving America, I’ll hope I’ll be able to continue that quintessential American pastime, which feels so impossible right now: to dream, and dream, and dream.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what?

6,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,ACLU Sues After ICE Contractors Attack Lawyer Seeking To Aid Migrant Kids Locked In Hotel,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A disturbing video released by the Texas Civil Rights Project shows an ugly confrontation between private contractors for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a lawyer trying to help asylum-seeking migrant children locked up in a McAllen, Texas, hotel. The chilling scene at the Hampton Inn & Suites, which can be seen below, helped trigger a lawsuit late Friday by the Texas group and the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportation of the children being detained by the Trump administration in hotels. The suit is also demanding an opportunity for the children to talk to a lawyer. BREAKING: Our attorney was aggressively rejected from trying to offer help to immigrant children illegally detained at a Hampton Inn in McAllen, TX. He and another of our staffer were violently shoved into the hotel elevator and were told they could not offer help. #FreeThemALL! https://t.co/xSOxHOViKp pic.twitter.com/MEp7UmK6Gv “The Trump administration is holding children in secret in hotels, refusing to give lawyers access to them so it can expel them back to danger without even a chance for the children to show they warrant asylum,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told CBS News. “Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a series of steps taken by the Trump administration to abuse and terrorize children.” The suit was filed in U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., on behalf of an unknown number of children in U.S. custody who were at the hotel — but have since vanished. Immigration officials have refused to say how many children were being held at the hotel as of Thursday, provide their names, or reveal where they are now, according to the lawsuit. The Hampton Inn hotel in McAllen is one of three where children as young as a year old have been held, according to records obtained by The Associated Press. The hotels — the others are in El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix — have been used nearly 200 times as more than 10,000 beds for children remain empty at official government detention centers, the AP reported Wednesday. The migrant children are reportedly being grabbed at the border and held at the hotels for weeks with little to no apparent government supervision or access to legal representation, and deported. On Thursday, contract guards blocked a lawyer for the Texas Civil Rights Project attempting to walk down a corridor to reach detainees in the McAllen hotel. The lawyer demanded: “Who are you? Are you police?” They shoved him roughly against the wall and responded: “Don’t worry about who we are. Get out if you’re smart.” The lawyer shouted to those detained to yell out their names. ICE told the AP that the private contractors are “transportation specialists” who are trained to work with children. Federal anti-trafficking laws and a long-term court settlement that governs the treatment of migrant children require that most kids be sent to supervised government shelters for a limited time before placement with family sponsors. The Trump administration is using the COVID-19 pandemic to skirt those requirements. At least 2,000 unaccompanied children have been expelled since March. “They’ve created a shadow system in which there’s no accountability for expelling very young children,” Leecia Welch, an attorney at the nonprofit National Center for Youth Law, told the AP. Late Friday, Hilton confirmed in a statement that its Hampton Inn & Suites in McAllen had “accepted reservations from a private contractor working on behalf of U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement ... to house migrants, including minors.” It said the hotel was no longer providing rooms for any migrants in U.S. custody. The company is also instructing all franchises and management companies not to rent rooms to detain children. “Our policy has always been that hotels should not be used as detention centers or for detaining individuals. We expect all Hilton properties to reject business that would use a hotel in this way,” the company said. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Lewis will first be honored at an invitation-only ceremony Monday, the lawmakers said. The public will be allowed to pay their respects “in a socially-distant manner” later that day and on Tuesday. Pelosi and McConnell said mourners would be required to wear masks. The late John Lewis to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda.

Former Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who died last year, was the first. Only about three dozen people, including 12 presidents and four Unknown Soldiers, have been honored in this way. Lewis, who helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and was dubbed the “conscience of Congress,” died last week at the age of 80 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. “I have been in some kind of fight ― for freedom, equality, basic human rights ― for nearly my entire life,” Lewis said in a December 2019 statement about his diagnosis. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Esteemed Civil Rights Organizer C.T. Vivian Laid To Rest In Atlanta,social-justice," ATLANTA (AP) — The nation paid its final respects Thursday to the Rev. C.T. Vivian, a pioneer of the Civil Rights Movement who helped end segregation across the South and left an abiding imprint on U.S. history. Vivian, a close ally of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was mourned by civil rights icons along with TV personality and author Oprah Winfrey, baseball legend Hank Aaron and others during a funeral at Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta. Vivian died July 17 at age 95. “C.T. was truly a remarkable man, a man whose physical courage was exceeded only by his moral courage, whose capacity for love overwhelmed incredible hatreds, whose faith and the power of nonviolence helped forever change our nation,” former Vice President Joe Biden said in a video tribute aired during the service. “In Illinois, and in Tennessee and Florida, and Mississippi — in the north and in the south — CT was there fighting to turn us back toward justice,” Biden added. Vivian’s death came the same day as the passing of another civil rights icon, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, 80. In 1965, Alabama state troopers beat Lewis in Selma, Alabama, helping to galvanize national opposition to racial segregation. Details of Lewis’ funeral have yet to be announced. At Vivian’s funeral in Atlanta on Thursday, many of those who eulogized Vivian described him as a courageous soldier for God and civil rights who always remained humble. “He didn’t want attention, he didn’t want money, he only wanted to do God’s will and bring out the best in these United States of America and its people regardless of their race, creed, color or national origin,” Ambassador Andrew Young said in his videotaped remarks. Vivian’s preaching was described as “an echo from heaven” by civil rights activist Bernard Lafayette. But it was his work during the Civil Rights Movement and the decades that followed that left an impression on Winfrey. She worked with Vivian on a series of racial seminars that aired on her TV show in the 1990s, she recalled in her video tribute during the funeral. “In his presence we were always learning more about our country, about ourselves, about what it means to stand for what is right,” Winfrey said. “He was a giant for justice.” More than a decade before lunch-counter protests made headlines during the Civil Rights Movement, Vivian began organizing sit-ins against segregation in Peoria, Illinois, in the 1940s. He later joined forces with King and organized the Freedom Rides across the South to halt segregation. Vivian was passionate about voting rights. In 1965, he led dozens of marchers to a courthouse in Selma, Alabama, and confronted the local sheriff on the courthouse steps, telling him the marchers should be allowed to register to vote. The sheriff responded by punching Vivian in the head. Vivian later discussed the experience in a video that includes film footage of the confrontation and attack. “The number of times he faced down being drowned, being beaten, being reviled only to stand up straight as a ramrod, bloodied but unbent, and declare the truth he saw so clearly: you can not turn your back on the idea of justice,” Biden said. Vivian was honored by former President Barack Obama with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. On Wednesday, the eve of his funeral, a horse-drawn carriage took his casket from the Georgia Capitol, where a memorial service was held, to King’s tomb in Atlanta. At Thursday’s funeral, Aaron said, “I got to love him really, not know him.” “I loved him for what he stood for and what he did, the things that he did,” Aaron said in videotaped remarks shown during the service. Several friends said Vivian’s legacy will live on in the nation’s continuing struggle for civil rights for all. “For me, C.T. was a dream keeper, always holding fast for dreams of a better world,” said Vivian’s longtime friend David McCord."
13,'There Will Always Be Struggle': Generations Of Black Americans Have Fought For Justice,social-justice," Politics fellow Several days after police killed George Floyd this spring, civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) lamented that too little had changed since a white mob lynched 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955. “Despite real progress, I can’t help but think of young Emmett today as I watch video after video after video of unarmed Black Americans being killed, and falsely accused,” Lewis said in a May 30 statement. “My heart breaks for these men and women, their families, and the country that let them down — again.” Lewis, who died last Friday at age 80, had fought for the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. He’d led the “Bloody Sunday” march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, when the brutal response of law enforcement gained national attention. And this year, he again called on people of “all faiths and no faiths, and all backgrounds, creeds, and colors” to take up the fight for racial justice. In the 58 days since police killed Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement has won some victories. Cities across the nation have begun to rethink policing, officers involved in Floyd’s death have been arrested and charged, and long-standing racist monuments have been taken down. But there’s much left to do, and historians note that if the past is a guide, the movement is still gaining momentum. “We are still in the middle of this moment,” said Charles McKinney, a professor of African American history at Rhodes College. Just like in the past, photos and video footage have shown what the Black Lives Matter movement is saying ― from the May 5 cellphone video of armed white men in a suburban neighborhood in Georgia chasing and gunning down Ahmaud Arbery to the footage of the last breathless minutes of Floyd’s life. Though Americans have long known about systemic racism and have seen instances of police brutality before ― “250 million white people didn’t wake up three months ago and say, ‘Oh my god, police brutality is a thing?’” McKinney said ― these latest images have forced a mainstream conversation. But as McKinney noted, “Images don’t necessarily translate into automatic slam-dunk wins and victories.” “These moments where we have video footage of people ― Black people in particular ― being murdered, those images can be widely disseminated. There can be lots and lots of conversations about what we have seen. People can be mad, sad, outraged, angered, disappointed,” he said. “We go through all those cycles, and at the end of the day, it is still an open question of whether or not the murderers will be brought to justice and if systems can be altered and shifted and improved for the better.” Aaron Bryant, social justice curator for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, said that while Black Americans may not be optimistic that change will occur quickly, they are hopeful it will come someday. “People haven’t given up hope on the American promise or their rights to full citizenship as Americans, and I think that is really important,” Bryant said. Both hope and stamina are crucial, he said, because “this whole idea of freedom and progress is really through struggle. And there will always be struggle.” It has been 65 years since Till was murdered, and the fight for civil rights and social justice has continued. Here are some of the key moments: Emmett Till was beaten and killed in Mississippi after a white woman falsely accused him of sexual harassment. He was 14. His murderers were acquitted. The brutality of his death and the publicity that followed sparked outrage and forced America to look at the enduring violence against Black Americans. Rosa Parks, a Black woman in Montgomery, Alabama, refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white person, a requirement under city segregation laws. This led to her arrest. The NAACP organized a one-day boycott of the bus system, which ultimately continued for 382 days. Later, when reflecting on her actions, Parks said, “I thought of Emmett Till, and when the bus driver ordered me to move to the back, I just couldn’t move.” The Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. It ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system in December, ending the boycott. Black college students Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil organized a sit-in at the Woolworth’s lunch counter in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. Staffers refused them service, but the students refused to give up their seats. The Greensboro Four, as they were later known, were spurred to action by Till’s murder. Sit-ins spread throughout the nation and participants faced fines, arrests and, in many cases, violence. In the summer of 1960, after tens of thousands of students had joined the sit-ins, many dining facilities were integrated, and at the end of July, the lunch counter at Woolworth’s was finally open to Black patrons as well as white ones. The Freedom Riders sought to test the Supreme Court’s 1960 decision in Boynton v. Virginia, which held that segregation of interstate transportation facilities, including bus terminals, violated federal law. Civil rights activists rode interstate buses throughout the American South, using those facilities the court had ordered to be integrated to challenge the non-enforcement of the court’s decision. The protesters were met by arrests, violent attacks and angry white mobs. The Interstate Commerce Commission issued regulations banning the segregation of all interstate buses, trains and air terminals, causing signs indicating “colored” and “white” sections to come down all through the South. Black men, women and youth took to the streets in Birmingham, Alabama, for peaceful protests. They were met with violent attacks ― including high-pressure fire hoses and police dogs ― which produced some of the most memorable and troubling images of the civil rights movement. The protesters were calling for desegregation in the city. A month later, the city desegregated lunch counters, removed “White Only” and “Black Only” signs from restrooms and drinking fountains, and released a Negro Job Improvement Plan, which focused on employing Black workers. Three times that month, protesters set off on a 54-mile walk from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery, as part of an effort to register Black voters in the South. They were repeatedly met with violence, most infamously on “Bloody Sunday,” when officers tackled the marchers to the ground, chased them down with horses, beat them with whips and batons, and used tear gas. But after Bloody Sunday, the marchers picked themselves up and tried again and again. The third march reached Montgomery. Following years of struggle to secure Black Americans’ right to vote, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed by President Lyndon Johnson. Los Angeles erupted into protests over the acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King ― video of that assault on a Black man became a media sensation ― as well as the probation order for a store owner who had shot and killed a 15-year-old Black girl, Latasha Harlins. Once the protests turned violent, looting and burning followed. After six days of unrest and efforts to quell that unrest, 63 people were dead and over 2,000 injured. The Rodney King beating set off a yearslong effort to reform the Los Angeles Police Department. The Christopher Commission was established even before the 1992 unrest to conduct a full examination of LAPD operations. Its July 1991 report laid out the widespread use of excessive force throughout the department. Five years later, the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating the department. In May 2000, it said it had found “a pattern or practice of excessive force, false arrests, and unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Justice Department made reform recommendations, and in November 2000, it reached a consent decree with the city allowing for five years of independent monitoring. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager who was on his way home from the convenience store. Even after the 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman not to pursue the “suspicious person” he reported, Zimmerman trailed and shot Martin. The 17-year-old was carrying an iced tea and candy. Protests followed as the nation once again grappled with racism and injustice. But Zimmerman was acquitted in court. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was first shared on Twitter. It ultimately became the name of an activist organization and the shorthand for a movement. After an officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a Black teenager, protests flared up across Ferguson, Missouri, and were met with a violent police crackdown watched across America. The unrest in Ferguson and elsewhere became a turning point in the conversation about race. One of its major outcomes was dubbed the “Ferguson Effect” ― the theory that the exposure of police brutality cultivated by media coverage of the protests led to increased levels of distrust in the police among Americans. In the midst of an arrest, a New York police officer used a chokehold on Eric Garner, a Black man, even though that tactic had been banned by the police department. The officer continued to hold Garner on the ground even as he desperately cried “I can’t breathe” over and over. Bystanders caught it all on video. Protests erupted across New York after a grand jury declined to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who killed Garner. Five years after Garner died, the NYPD finally fired Officer Pantaleo. After a Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck and killed him, the nation responded in widespread protests. People in all 50 states joined in Black Lives Matter demonstrations, even in small rural communities where such protests seemed inconceivable just one year before. The recent deaths of Arbery in Georgia at the hands of armed civilians and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky by police executing a no-knock search warrant also fueled the protests. Americans who had lived the Black Lives Matter movement were joined by others who were finally seeing the truth. Politics fellow Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,"Migrant Kids Held In U.S. Hotels, Then Expelled",social-justice," HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels, sometimes for weeks, before deporting them to their home countries under policies that have effectively shut down the nation’s asylum system during the coronavirus pandemic, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. A private contractor for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is taking children to three Hampton Inn & Suites hotels in Arizona and at the Texas-Mexico border, where they are typically detained for several days, the records show. The hotels have been used nearly 200 times, while more than 10,000 beds for children sit empty at government shelters. Federal anti-trafficking laws and a two-decade-old court settlement that governs the treatment of migrant children require that most kids be sent to the shelters for eventual placement with family sponsors. But President Donald Trump’s administration is now immediately expelling people seeking asylum in the U.S., relying on a public health declaration to set aside those rules. Lawyers and advocates say housing unaccompanied migrant children in hotels exposes them to the risk of trauma as they’re detained in places not designed to hold them and cared for by contractors with unclear credentials. They are challenging the use of hotels as detention spaces under the Flores court settlement. “They’ve created a shadow system in which there’s no accountability for expelling very young children,” said Leecia Welch, an attorney at the nonprofit National Center for Youth Law. “There really aren’t enough words to describe what a disgraceful example of sacrificing children this is to advance heartless immigration policies.” ICE largely declined to answer questions but referred to the contractors as “transportation specialists” who are “non-law enforcement staff members trained to work with minors and to ensure that all aspects of the transport or stay are compliant” with the court settlement. It wouldn’t say whether they’re licensed child care professionals or have received FBI background checks. In McAllen, Texas, people in scrubs went room to room on the fourth and fifth floors of the Hampton Inn caring for children, according to Roberto Lopez of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project. He walked through the hotel Friday, spotting a small child holding on to a gate in a doorway as an adult on the other side played with him. Lopez said he could hear the cries of at least one child in the hallway. Parked outside were unmarked white vans with the silhouettes of adults and children visible through the windows, Lopez said. He didn’t see logos or insignia for any government agencies on the vans or in the hotel. The records obtained by AP show the Hampton Inn in McAllen was used most often to detain children — 123 times over two months. The other hotels are in Phoenix and El Paso. Hilton, which owns the Hampton Inn brand, said in a statement Tuesday that all three hotels were franchises and it believed rooms were booked directly with those owners. Hilton wouldn’t say how many rooms had been used to detain children or how much the rooms cost. “We understand these properties have been used for their intended purpose — temporary accommodation for guests traveling between locations,” the statement said. Castle Hospitality, which operates the McAllen hotel, said it didn’t know its rooms would be used to detain children until they arrived. “We are not making any political statements one way or the other by taking in this group and we feel that anyone, especially children in such difficult circumstances, is entitled to safe and clean accommodations and that’s what we aim to provide,” a company statement said. “In our conversations with the group contact, we have been assured that all state and federal regulations are being followed.” At least 2,000 children have been expelled since March, when the Trump administration announced it would broadly refuse entry to people seeking protection in the U.S. The administration has cited the threat of the coronavirus in saying it doesn’t have the resources to allow migrants to stay. The U.S. has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world, and the virus is ravaging much of the West and South, including Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, where McAllen is located. Before March, Central American children who crossed into the U.S. alone were generally sent to facilities overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS facilities have bedrooms and schooling, and children are given access to lawyers and generally placed with family sponsors. The facilities also are licensed by the states where they’re located. Federal anti-trafficking law requires the government to promptly refer most children to HHS. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it made 1,564 apprehensions of unaccompanied children at the southern border in June, HHS says it received just 61. CBP wouldn’t say how many children are expelled right away, how many are sent to hotels or how border agents decide between those options or referral to HHS. The agency referred questions about hotels to ICE. ICE said it uses contractor MVM Inc. “to transport single minors to hotels and to ensure each minor remains safe and secure while in this temporary housing.” MVM had a contract with ICE for “transportation services” extended for $49 million on March 31, according to federal contracting data. The company declined to answer questions. According to MVM’s hiring website, it’s looking for “bilingual travel youth care workers” based in Phoenix and McAllen to provide “humble care and service to unaccompanied children and teens.” The posting doesn’t require a child care background but says selected applicants will be given a “government background investigation.” The border agencies and MVM have been criticized for their treatment of immigrant children during the Trump administration, including wide-scale family separations in 2018 and the detention of children in squalid border stations in Texas last year. The government provided records on the detention of children and teenagers expelled in April and June to a team of lawyers representing the interests of immigrant children under the Flores agreement, reached in 1997. Records for May weren’t available. The Hampton Inns in McAllen, El Paso and Phoenix were used 186 times. No other hotels appear in the records, which indicate that 169 children were detained at the hotels, some with multiple stays. At least two 1-year-olds were held for three days. But some young children, including 3- to 5-year-olds, were detained for two weeks or longer. One 5-year-old was detained for 19 days in the McAllen hotel. The records indicate the children were not accompanied by a parent but don’t say more about the circumstances of their crossing the border. In the past, some very young children have been brought by older siblings or other relatives. Others have been sent by parents waiting for their court dates in refugee camps on the U.S.-Mexico border with hopes they will be placed with relatives. Karla Vargas, a Texas Civil Rights Project lawyer, represented a 13-year-old girl who was detained in a hotel and later expelled to El Salvador. Vargas said border agents didn’t tell the girl’s mother in the U.S. that they had detained her daughter. A person who crossed the border with the girl called her mother. “The children with whom we’ve spoken say there are other children in the hotels,” Vargas said. “We know that there are masses of children.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,NFL To Allow Players To Put Social Justice Decals On Helmets,social-justice," The NFL is planning to allow players to have decals on the back of their helmets bearing names or initials of victims of systemic racism and police violence. The league has been in talks with individual players and their union since June about somehow honoring such victims. The initiative will be done leaguewide, with each team deciding who it will honor and how to display the names or initials. Unlike the NBA, which is allowing players to wear slogans on their jerseys, the NFL will stick to names and initials once a final agreement has been reached with the players’ association. The program will continue for the entire season. This initiative is something of a breakthrough because the league has not allowed such messaging, except for during its October NFL Crucial Catch program in conjunction with the fight against breast cancer, and in its November salutes to the military. Players also have been allowed to represent a cause on their cleats one weekend per season. But a 17-week campaign such as the one being planned is something new for the NFL. A list of names and initials for use on the helmet decals is being put together by the league and the NFLPA. Players have been encouraged to provide those names and initials. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"

0,How The Black Lives Matter Generation Remembers John Lewis,social-justice," Of all the ways that John Lewis influenced American life and politics, his indelible impact on young people may be among the most enduring. From student activist to elder statesman, Lewis continually encouraged the nation’s youth to start “good trouble” — and modeled just how to do that. He was arrested alongside millennial activists pushing for comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws in 2013. He led a sit-in in the House of Representatives over gun control following a mass shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando in 2016. And when he was not protesting, he was helping young people understand history, as when he cosplayed as his younger self at San Diego’s Comic-Con to celebrate the release of his Selma, Alabama-themed graphic novel series in 2015. Lewis, the Black civil rights icon who some called the “conscience of Congress,” died Friday. In one of his last public appearances, he posed for a picture in June, standing on the Black Lives Matter Plaza mural painted just outside of the White House amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd. For the Black Lives Matter generation, the connection to Lewis is deeper than many may realize. As a young man, through clouds of teargas and a hail of billy clubs, Lewis nearly lost his life marching against segregation and for voting rights. As a Georgia congressman, Lewis was generous with his time, taking meetings and sharing stages with activists who, from Sanford, Florida, to Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore to Minneapolis, also withstood teargas — as well as rubber bullets, pepper spray and arrests — in their own protests against racism. “He didn’t have to stand with us, he chose to,” Malkia Devich Cyril, the founder and senior fellow of MediaJustice, which advocates for open and democratic media and technology platforms, told The Associated Press. “That’s real leadership.” In exclusive interviews with the AP, prominent organizers from the Black Lives Matter movement reflected on Lewis’ example and his kinship with their generation: BRITTANY PACKNETT CUNNINGHAM, Ferguson activist and educator: “I remember sitting on the other side of President Obama from (Lewis) at this pretty historic, multigenerational civil rights meeting, and understanding the optical placement of the generations in that moment. And I just kept thinking to myself, do not let John Lewis down. … I was finally able to thank him, face to face, eye to eye, for treading the path my generation was now walking. … With kindness in his eyes and determination in his voice, he reminded me that the road to freedom is never easy — and that’s precisely why we have to keep taking it. ‘You’ll have setbacks,’ he told me. ‘Keep going. Be consistent. You will get there.’” PHILLIP AGNEW, co-founder of the Dream Defenders, a police and prison abolition group, and organizer in the Movement for Black Lives: “I think the first time I ever met him was at (Congressional Black Caucus Foundation), the legislative forum that they have every year. This is kind of after Dream Defenders had taken over the Capitol of Florida, and there was a big buzz about our little fledgling group at that time. I didn’t think that he would know who I was — I absolutely knew who he was. … And I remember him coming and speaking to me and saying how proud he was, looking at the things that we had done in Florida.” PATRISSE CULLORS, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and its global network of chapters: “The first time I was introduced to Congressman Lewis was through (the 1990 PBS docuseries) ‘Eyes on the Prize.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, that’s me.’ He was a young, radical Black man who was challenging not just the status quo in government, but also the older leadership in the movement. And I felt really moved by him. … What I witnessed significantly in ‘Eyes on the Prize’ was police terror and police brutality, and the way that it was used against the (Edmund) Pettus Bridge protesters … who were brutalized fighting for a more equitable America, for Black people in particular. And so, we fast forward to 2020, when we have been in the streets, and the same tactics of the police being used against us as a way to deter us from fighting for Black freedom. And yet, that never deterred Congressman Lewis. ... That is a deeply moving commitment to Black people.” ALENCIA JOHNSON, political strategist and movement organizer: “I had the opportunity to staff (former Democratic presidential candidate) Sen. Elizabeth Warren, when we did the Edmund Pettus Bridge crossing, the Sunday before Super Tuesday, when I was working on her campaign. And (Lewis) came. It was like he was literally passing the torch to everyone who was there. ... That symbol of him coming from his sick bed, all the way to Selma was just so, wow, I’m actually getting emotional thinking about that. … He was so intentional and persistent about ensuring that people who are fighting know that they have his support and his admiration. He talked about how he admires how young people are showing up now.” ASH-LEE WOODARD HENDERSON, co-executive director of the Highlander Center for Research and Education, a social justice leadership training school: “I’ve been thinking about how important John Lewis’ life has been and will continue to be for weeks. And this moment still feels so freaking unfair. ... I remember the stories and encouragement. The never-wavering mandate. … I will remember a man who reminded us all that our optimism isn’t futile. That building a global neighborhood and a building beloved community are similar but not the same. … That’s the legacy. That’s the work. I’m so grateful, in this sea of grief, for such a divine human who loved us so deeply.” CHARLENE CARRUTHERS, founding national director of BYP100, a Black youth organizing group, and Movement for Black Lives organizer: “Looking at his work and his story, if I can even do half of that with my life then I’d consider it a worthy contribution. And it’s not about being perfect. But it is about saying, ‘I’m going to be in this for my entire life.’ I’m in this thing. Not for fame, not for glory. He could have done something else. His legacy is one of making a lifetime commitment to Black people.” CHELSEA FULLER, spokesperson for the Movement for Black Lives and deputy communications director for Blackbird, which supports grassroots movements: “In 2000, I was 12 years old and, like most children that age, struggling to comprehend the possibilities of who I could become. … He asked me if I liked school and what I wanted to do when I was all grown up. I told him I didn’t know, but that I liked to write and that I liked Black history, but didn’t think there was much I could do outside of being a professor. He took my hand and looked me square in the eye and said that loving my people and being a storyteller were not small things; but that they were powerful. … Congressman John Lewis encouraged me to see the power in stories about our people and our fight for freedom.” ___ Morrison is a member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

1,"14 Hours Later, Trump Says He Is 'Saddened' By Lewis' Death",social-justice," WASHINGTON (AP) — In the hours after the death of American civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to retweet old missives about Democratic rival Joe Biden and lash out at his former national security adviser and his niece for writing tell-all books about him. Trump then headed to his golf course in northern Virginia with a political confidant, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, for a nearly four-hour outing. Shortly after 2 p.m., as Trump was returning from his golf outing — and more than 14 hours after Lewis’ death was announced — he offered his and the first lady’s condolences in a two-sentence Twitter message. “Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,” Trump wrote. By that point all four living former U.S. presidents, Vice President Mike Pence and scores of lawmakers had publicly remarked on the passing of the lawmaker whose brutal beating on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, 50 years earlier marked a turning point in the civil rights movement. Trump had battled publicly with Lewis, 80, the youngest and last living member of the Big Six civil rights activists who organized the 1963 March on Washington. Lewis, D-Ga., memorably tangled with Trump days before the president’s inauguration in 2017. The congressman said he did not see Trump as a “legitimate president,” prompting Trump to blast Lewis as “all talk” and denigrate his majority Black district as “crime infested” and “falling apart.” For the second time during his long service in Congress, Lewis in 2017 skipped the swearing-in ceremony. He also skipped George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001 after his contentious victory over Al Gore. In December of that year, Lewis refused to speak at the opening of Mississippi civil rights and history museums because Trump would be there. He said the president’s “hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum.” Then, as this year’s election battle heated up in the spring, Lewis threw his weight behind Biden and urged young Black voters to help make sure the former vice president wins in November. He didn’t mention Trump by name during his April endorsement, but made clear that he saw Biden’s mission as a chance to “redeem the soul of America.” Rep. Karen Bass, the Democratic chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote on Twitter that she hoped that Trump would stay silent about Lewis’ death. At that point, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany had noted that Lewis “was an icon of the civil rights movement,” and Pence had issued a statement praising Lewis for his place in American history and noting that as colleagues in the House that “even when we differed, John was always unfailingly kind.” Bass wrote: “@realDonaldTrump while the nation mourns the passing of a national hero, please say nothing. Please don’t comment on the life of Congressman Lewis. Your press secretary released a statement, leave it at that.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Bass’ statement. The White House also issued a proclamation from the president ordering the lowering of U.S. flags at federal buildings for Lewis’ death. By law the flag is lowered the day after a sitting member of Congress passes. In some ways, Trump’s perfunctory offering of condolences showed a measure of restraint compared with some past episodes involving political opponents. The president was not invited to attend Sen. John McCain’s funeral in 2018. Trump had said earlier that he didn’t think McCain was a hero because the senator was captured in Vietnam. McCain was tortured and held prisoner for more than five years. Trump seemed unable to forget one of McCain’s Senate votes in particular, the thumbs-down that sank the Republican effort in 2017 to repeal the Obama health care law. Trump was furious, and it showed even after McCain’s death. The administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff, but then raised it again two days later. The flags were lowered again after a public outcry. And Trump’s anti-McCain Twitter tirades continued long after his death from brain cancer. The president also complained that he was never properly thanked for McCain’s funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. Trump drew criticism late last year for suggesting the late Rep. John Dingell, a Democrat, might be “looking up” from hell during a rally in Dingell’s home state of Michigan. The dig at Dingell, whose wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell, succeeded him in the House, came during Trump’s impeachment. Days earlier, Trump expressed anger that the congresswoman had supported his impeachment. “The last time I spoke to Debbie Dingell was her call thanking me for granting top memorial and funeral service honors for her then just departed husband, long time Congressman John Dingell,” Trump tweeted. “Now I watch her ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax.

2,Barack Obama: John Lewis 'Risked His Life' So This Nation Could 'Live Up To Its Promise',social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rep. John Lewis battled tirelessly for civil rights inspired by a faith that humanity yearns to do what’s right, former President Barack Obama wrote in a moving tribute to his friend on Friday. “He loved this country so much that he risked his life and his blood so that it might live up to its promise,” Obama wrote after Lewis’ death from pancreatic cancer. “And through the decades, he not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example.” He “embraced the principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience as the means to bring about real change — understanding that such tactics had the power not only to change laws, but to change hearts and minds as well,” added Obama, who in 2011 awarded the congressman the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And though he was exceptional, Lewis always believed that everyone could do exactly what he did, Obama recalled. “He believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, a longing to do what’s right, a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect,” Obama wrote. “And it’s because he saw the best in all of us that he will continue, even in his passing, to serve as a beacon in that long journey towards a more perfect union.” Obama said that after he became an Illinois senator, he told Lewis he was standing “on his shoulders” because of the congressman’s struggles for civil rights. “When I was elected President of the United States, I hugged him on the inauguration stand before I was sworn in and told him I was only there because of the sacrifices he made,” Obama noted. Lewis and Obama last shared a public forum with activists helping to organize Black Lives Matter marches in the wake of the brutal police killing of George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. “He could not have been prouder of their efforts — of a new generation standing up for freedom and equality, a new generation intent on voting and protecting the right to vote, a new generation running for political office,” Obama wrote. “I told him that all those young people — of every race, from every background and gender and sexual orientation — they were his children.” “Thanks to him, we now all have our marching orders,” the former president wrote.

3,"Rep. John Lewis, Civil Rights Icon, Dies At Age 80",social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Rep. John Lewis, the legendary civil rights leader who helped organize the March on Washington and was later known as the “conscience of Congress,” died Friday at age 80. The Georgia Democrat announced in December 2019 that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. “I have been in some kind of fight ― for freedom, equality, basic human rights ― for nearly my entire life,” Lewis said in a statement at the time. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.” Lewis has been on the front lines of the fight for democracy for most of his life. Born on Feb. 21, 1940, to sharecroppers outside of Troy, Alabama, Lewis grew up attending segregated public schools. After watching the activism that sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and hearing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s words on the radio, Lewis was inspired to join the civil rights movement and fought for voting rights ever since. As a college student attending Fisk University, Lewis helped organize peaceful sit-in protests at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee. At age 21, he volunteered to be a Freedom Rider — one of the activists who risked their lives challenging segregation throughout the South by sitting in seats reserved for white people. (The protest was inspired by Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her bus seat for a white man in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.) Lewis helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and became its chairman during the peak of the civil rights movement from 1963 to 1966. Lewis organized student activism in the movement through SNCC and was eventually considered one of the “Big Six” leaders of the civil rights movement, alongside King. At 23, Lewis was one of the organizers of and the youngest keynote speaker at the March on Washington in August 1963. He helped launch voter registration drives during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, yet another example of his determination to bring voting rights to Black people. Lewis often faced violent consequences for his civil rights leadership. He was repeatedly arrested and beaten by police and angry mobs for challenging Jim Crow segregation in the South and fighting for voting rights. Alabama state troopers fractured Lewis’ skull in March 1965 while he led more than 600 peaceful demonstrators in a voting rights protest across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, during what became known as Bloody Sunday. Media coverage of the cruelty during Bloody Sunday ― and the subsequent successful Selma march in which Lewis walked alongside King ― helped usher in the passage of the Voting Rights Act that year. Lewis was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981 and to Congress in 1986. He served as House Democrats’ senior chief deputy whip and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Throughout his congressional career, Lewis fought to enact laws that furthered the civil rights and moral principles that he had championed since he was a young man. He helped campaign for Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who lost the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia and has since dedicated her career to fighting for voting rights amid allegations of Black voter suppression in the state. “I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, 53 years ago,” Lewis told a crowd at a rally for Abrams just days before the election. “I’m not asking any of you to give any blood. I’m just asking you to go and vote like you never voted before. We have to vote.” Lewis was also unfiltered in his criticism of President Donald Trump and refused to attend the 2018 State of the Union address after Trump characterized Haiti and African nations as “shitholes.” The congressman said in May 2019 that if King were alive today, Lewis would tell him that Trump is “a racist” who “doesn’t understand the meaning of your life and the significance of the civil rights movement.” Lewis was a strong supporter of impeaching Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, warning that the country he once considered a “beacon of hope” may be “descending into darkness.” Before voting to formally impeach the president in December 2019, Lewis delivered an emotional, fiery speech that alluded to his experiences in Washington that helped define the civil rights movement. “When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, do something,” the civil rights icon said. “Our children and their children will ask us: ‘What did you do? What did you say?’” Lewis held hope for the future of America even through the pandemic and widespread anger over civil rights. As protests erupted nationwide over the police slaying of a Black Minnesota man, George Floyd, Lewis remarked on the sheer scope of the movement. “I’ve come in contact with people who feel inspired. They’re moved. They’ve just never been along in a protest — they’ve never been in a march before — they decided to march with their children and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren and to walk with them,” he said in June. “They’re helping to educate and inspire another generation of activists. It’s seeing an effect. There can be no turning back; there can be no giving up.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,social-justice," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,social-justice," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Civil Rights Leader Rev. C.T. Vivian Dies At 95,social-justice," ATLANTA (AP) — The Rev. C.T. Vivian, a civil rights veteran who worked alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, has died. Vivian died at home in Atlanta of natural causes Friday morning, his friend and business partner Don Rivers confirmed to The Associated Press. Vivian was 95. His civil rights work stretched back more than six decades, to his first sit-in demonstrations in the 1940s in Peoria, Ill. He met King soon after the budding civil rights leader’s victory in the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. Vivian helped organize the Freedom Rides to integrate buses across the South and trained waves of activists in non-violent protest. It was Vivian’s bold challenge of a segregationist sheriff while trying to register Black voters in Selma, Alabama, that sparked hundreds, then thousands, to march across the Edmund Pettus bridge. “He has always been one of the people who had the most insight, wisdom, integrity and dedication,” said Andrew Young, who also worked alongside King. President Barack Obama honored Vivian the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. The reverend had continued to advocate for justice and equality in recent years. Speaking with students in Tennessee 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, he explained that the civil rights movement was effective because activists used strategies to make sure that their messages were amplified. “This is what made the movement; our voice was really heard. But it didn’t happen by accident; we made certain it was heard,” Vivian said. Cordy Tindell Vivian was born July 28, 1924, in Howard County, Mo., but moved to Macomb, Ill., with his mother when he was still a young boy. As a young theology student at the American Baptist College in Nashville, Tenn., Vivian helped organize that city’s first sit-ins. Under King’s leadership at SCLC, Vivian was national director of affiliates, traveling around the South to register voters. In 1965 in Selma, he was met on the Dallas County courthouse by Sheriff Jim Clark, who listened as Vivian argued for voting rights, and then punched him in the mouth. Vivian stood back up and kept talking as the cameras rolled before he was stitched up and jailed. His mistreatment, seen on national television, eventually drew thousands of protesters, whose determination to march from Selma to Montgomery pressured Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act later that year. Vivian continued to serve in the SCLC after King’s assassination in 1968, and became its interim president in 2012, lending renewed credibility and a tangible link to the civil rights era after the SCLC stagnated for years due to financial mismanagement and infighting. “There must always be the understanding of what Martin had in mind for this organization,” Vivian said in a 2012 interview. “Nonviolent, direct action makes us successful. We learned how to solve social problems without violence. We cannot allow the nation or the world to ever forget that.” Vivian had a stroke about two months ago but seemed to recover, Rivers said. Then, “he just stopped eating,” he said. Rivers, 67, said he was 21 when he met Vivian at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Back then, he worked as an audio director when Vivian was the dean of the university’s divinity school. The two remained close over the years and Rivers said he handled the business side of Vivian’s work. “He’s such a nice, gentle, courageous man,” Rivers said, adding that the reverend wasn’t in it for the money but, “he was always giving, giving, giving.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,ViacomCBS Cuts Ties With Nick Cannon Over Anti-Semitic Podcast Rant,social-justice," Senior Editor, HuffPost ViacomCBS is cutting its relationship with TV host Nick Cannon over his rant based on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that aired on his podcast “Cannon’s Class,” which was posted to YouTube in June. A spokesperson for the media giant said in a statement to HuffPost that Cannon “promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories” during that episode. “ViacomCBS condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism,” the spokesperson said. “We are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him,” the spokesperson said, also noting that they spoke to Cannon about the podcast episode. The host of Fox’s “Masked Singer’ was interviewing former Public Enemy group member Richard “Professor Griff” Griffin during the podcast. Griffin was kicked out of the rap group for making similar anti-Semitic comments in the late 1980s. During the episode, Cannon claimed that Black people were the “true Hebrews” and referenced unfounded conspiracy theories about Jewish people, making reference to “the Rothschilds, centralized banking, the 13 families, the bloodlines that control everything even outside of America.” Throughout the interview, Cannon said multiple times that the discussion was not about hate, though he continued making disparaging claims about non-Black Jewish people. “The people that don’t have [melanin] are a little less,” Cannon said. He claimed that they were sent to the Caucasus, where “the sun then started to deteriorate them, so then they’re acting out of fear, they’re acting out of low self-esteem, they’re acting out of a deficiency.” “They had to be savages,” Cannon later said. During the episode, Griffin and Cannon praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who also had expressed anti-Semitic views. HuffPost has reached out to Fox Broadcasting Co. for comment on Cannon’s remarks and statement. After the resurfaced episode caused outrage over the weekend, Cannon addressed the controversy with a statement on his Facebook page. “Anyone who knows me knows that I have no hate in my heart nor malice intentions,” Cannon wrote, adding that he didn’t condone “hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric.” “We are living in a time when it is more important than ever to promote unity and understanding,” the TV host said. Cannon wrote: The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles.When you look at The Media, and other sectors in our nation’s history, African Americans and The people of the Jewish community have partnered to create some of the best, most revolutionary work we know today. I am an advocate for people’s voices to be heard openly, fairly and candidly. In today’s conversation about anti-racism and social justice, I think we all - including myself - must continue educating one another and embrace uncomfortable conversations - it’s the only way we ALL get better. Cannon told FastCompany on Monday that a few rabbis have reached out to him since the backlash began, and he said he wanted to have them on his podcast to continue the conversation. “My podcast is specifically an academic podcast to have tough and difficult conversations based off of text. And if we read something and something’s not accurate, let’s do away with it,” Cannon told FastCompany. “I can’t wait to sit down with some people that can help educate me and help further this conversation. I want to be corrected.” The host also addressed criticism that his statement issued Monday didn’t contain a formal apology. “What we need is healing,” he told the media site. “What we need is discussion. Correct me. I don’t tell my children to say, ‘I’m sorry.’ I want them to understand where they need to be corrected. And then that’s how we grow.” Read Cannon’s full statement: Senior Editor, HuffPost"

13,Facebook Boycott Organizers Call Mark Zuckerberg Meeting A 'Disappointment',social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Civil rights organizers calling for an advertising boycott of Facebook said their meeting on Tuesday with company CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg was ultimately a “disappointment.” In a scathing statement on the Stop Hate for Profit website, which urges brands to pull Facebook advertising for the month of July, organizers said it “was abundantly clear in our meeting today that Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook team is not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform.” “Zuckerberg offered the same old defense of white supremacist, antisemitic, Islamophobic and other hateful groups on Facebook that the Stop Hate for Profit Coalitions, advertisers and society at large have heard too many times before,” the statement reads. The group continued: “Zuckerberg offered no automatic recourse for advertisers whose content runs alongside hateful posts. He had no answer for why Facebook recommends hateful groups to users. He refused to agree to provide an option for victims of hate and harassment to connect with a live Facebook representative ... And he did not offer any tangible plans on how Facebook will address the rampant disinformation and violent conspiracies on its platform.” Stop Hate for Profit’s website lists 10 major demands, including that Facebook submit to regular independent audits and delete public and private groups focused on disinformation, conspiracy theories and white supremacy. According to the group’s statement, Facebook made no attempt to address the majority of these demands during the meeting, aside from the request to hire a civil rights consultant — though neither Zuckerberg nor Sandberg would commit to that role being at the C-suite level, Stop Hate for Profit said. “None of this is hard,” the statement said of the demands, “especially for one of the world’s most innovative companies whose founder coined the term move fast and break things. Mark Zuckerberg, you aren’t breaking things, you are breaking people.” Members of the Stop Hate for Profit collective, including Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, who had previously accused Zuckerberg of an “arrogant” unwillingness to police hate speech, reiterated their disappointment on social media. Met with Mark Zuckerberg and @Facebook leadership today. It was a disappointment. They have had our demands for years and yet it is abundantly clear that they are not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform. .@JGo4Justice: ""Instead of committing to a timeline to root out hate and disinformation on Facebook, the company’s leaders delivered the same old talking points to try to placate us without meeting our demands.""2/ #StopHateForProfit #ChangeTheTerms It cannot be understated that with a stroke of a pen, Facebook could be made safer and better for its users, advertisers and society on a whole. Yet, today they showed they don’t have interest in doing that. In a Facebook post prior to the meeting, Sandberg acknowledged that the company “has to get better at finding and removing hateful content” but was adamant that it had made progress and would release a two-year independent civil rights audit on Thursday. The NAACP, one of the advocacy groups comprising Stop Hate for Profit, said in a statement to HuffPost it “await[ed] the release of tomorrow’s civil rights audit report” and would continue to “hold Facebook accountable and work for real change.” Companies currently participating in Stop Hate for Profit’s initiative to remove Facebook ads for July include Adidas, Ben & Jerry’s, The North Face, Unilever and Verizon (which owns Verizon Media, HuffPost’s parent company).

14,Artists Enlist Skywriting Planes To Expose The ICE Detention Crisis In Our Backyards,social-justice," Fashion & Lifestyle Editor, HuffPost The Trump administration was dealt a blow last month when the Supreme Court ruled to leave the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which can protect individuals brought to the U.S. as children, in place for now. But thousands of other people who came to this country in hopes of immigrating are being held in detention centers around the country and are subject to abuse and deplorable conditions. This weekend, a collective of artists, led by Cassils and Rafa Esparza, are taking their work to the skies to call out that abuse and to make people aware of where it’s happening ― often right in their own backyards ― in hopes of inspiring them to do something about it. “In Plain Sight” is a group of more than 80 activist artists whose aerial actions will take place Friday through Sunday. They have enlisted “every type-writing plane in the United States” to create messages made of water vapor, which will be visible in the sky over more than 80 Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, immigration courts, borders, sites of former internment camps and other significant landmarks. Each message was picked by a specific artist, many of whom are personally connected to or have experienced either immigration detention or systemic violence in some way, whether based on sexuality, race, gender or immigration status. In that regard, the messages are also meant to express solidarity with people housed in the detention centers, which are often overcrowded, unhealthy and unsanitary. “This work is very much about artists who may come from divergent and different perspectives focusing on this issue of migrant detention and making visible the invisible violence taking place in our country right now ― not just at the border but in every single state,” Cassils told HuffPost by phone last week. “If you try to calculate how much money these camps are making, it would break your calculator.” Working with national and local nonprofits and organizations, the activist artwork aims to both raise awareness and send out a call to action for its viewers. Each sky-written message will end with the hashtag #XMAP, which, when typed into a browser on a phone, brings up a website with more information and resources on how people can provide support. “Using your phone signal, the hashtag will geolocate you and let you know exactly where the center is in your proximity,” Cassils said. “There are thousands of them, often interwoven in disturbing ways in our urban landscape, like next to an IKEA in Red Hook, Brooklyn. We want to make this visible but also educate ― once you know something you can’t un-know it, and now you have this ethical and moral quandary: Will I ignore this? Or will I do something about it?” Make the Road, a nonprofit based in New Jersey, will fly the message “Free them all” over the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark. Director Sara Cullinane explained why it wanted to participate in the project. “The day before Americans watch fireworks light up the sky in celebration of freedom and liberty, we will look to the skies across New Jersey to be reminded that liberty and justice are not available to everyone here,” she told HuffPost in an email. “In New Jersey, every year thousands of individuals are taken from their families and detained in four ICE detention centers, some housed in county jails that bring lucrative contracts to our counties. Detention is cruel and inhumane ― even before COVID, dozens of detainees died in ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] custody. Now is the moment for our government to release all detainees.” Cassils and Esparza say it is their duty as artists to speak truth to power and envision what a better, more just world would look like. “I am first-generation Mexican American,” Esparza told HuffPost. “My folks came to the States in the ’70s by whatever means they had to do so and make it here alive. There’s always this conversation and critique around whether or not you came here in the ‘right way,’ and I think experiencing my folks’ struggle to build a new life here while also seeing their practice of generosity, opening up their home to other immigrants, friends and family, while being resourceful to survive has informed so much of how I take on collaborations and make my art impactful.” Cassils, who moved to the United States from Canada, also has a personal connection to immigration. “The fact that it’s so financially motivated, the fact that I couldn’t afford a lawyer [to immigrate], I was trans, I was queer,” they said. “I’m not equating it with what most folks in this position go through, I was in a much more privileged position ― but it still took years and years to manage the system. I can’t even imagine how impossible the system that is so stacked against you is.” It’s that notion that inspired Esparza and Cassils to launch this project over the Fourth of July weekend. “I hope there is a broader sense of what it means for folks to really question what it means to be a patriot,” Esparza said. “Using our freedom of speech, engaging our rights as folks who live in the United States ― I hope it’s something that helps people bring into question their own engagements politically and civilly in this country.” Cassils also pointed to the misleading message on the Statue of Liberty and how difficult trying to make a new life in the United States can be for many who travel here. “It says come, you can make your living here, but it’s actually a mired system steeped in financial gain and exploitation that is so deeply problematic,” they said. “As a new citizen and learning about the extent that these camps exist, the thousands of people in cages, the children, the trans and queer people who came because if they stayed where they were they would die ― as an artist and a citizen, we need to do something about this. This is everyone’s issue.” Tania Bernal, of the California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance, explained to HuffPost in an email that the high stakes made the organization want to be involved in the action. “As undocumented youth who are abolitionists, CIYJA youth believe above all else that we have to get rid of the disease to end the symptoms of racist law enforcement and brutality,” Bernal said. “That disease is the carceral state, which includes prisons and detention facilities. Until they are abolished, we will continue to see the system dehumanize and target marginalized communities. That is why we have been so intentional about fighting for the most criminalized folks at Mesa Verde Detention Facility, to prove that even those most deemed disposable by the state are worthy of their humanity, of compassion, and of transformational growth.” When asked about what message they hope this sends to the U.S. government, Esparza said it is more for the people to take action ― but he did not mince words when it came to what that action looks like. “We can’t and won’t be silenced,” he said. “It’s been really important for us to be able to think about the urgency of this project as we move through 2020 and experience COVID and how it’s exacerbated the dire situation people in detention face. It’s important for us to continue speaking to power, to use our voices to elevate the voices of those who have been invisible, neglected and erased. I hope this is a project where people can see and feel that.” To learn more, head to the In Plain Sight website. Fashion & Lifestyle Editor, HuffPost"
15,Facebook Cracked Down On Extremism. It Only Took A Major Boycott And Multiple Killings.,social-justice," Senior World News Reporter, HuffPost Facebook announced on Tuesday that it had banned hundreds of accounts and dozens of groups dedicated to the far-right “boogaloo” movement, which has been linked to multiple extremist plots and killings in recent months. Facebook touted its action as “the latest step in our commitment to ban people who proclaim a violent mission from using our platform.” Other social media companies took similar actions against hate speech and extremism this week. Reddit announced that it banned about 2,000 of its online communities for violating its content policies, including the subreddit The_Donald, which had about 800,000 members who supported President Donald Trump. YouTube de-platformed several far-right extremists from its service, and the streaming service Twitch temporarily suspended Trump’s account for “hateful conduct.” But this isn’t a sea change in how these platforms address hateful content. Many experts instead see a slow, piecemeal approach by companies who have let extremism and political disinformation become pervasive ― and who are now facing strong backlash from advertisers and public criticism ahead of the 2020 election. At least 300 advertisers pulled their ads from Facebook’s properties for July as part of a boycott demanding the company adjust its practices. While headlines heralded a wave of tech platforms cracking down on hate speech, the recent actions were less drastic than they may seem. YouTube’s ban targeted outright white supremacists, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Trump is a minor figure on Twitch, and the number of his followers pales in comparison to those of the platform’s professional gamer stars. Meanwhile, although Reddit claimed its bans were part of a larger policy on hate, most of the subreddits it removed were inactive. The_Donald had been effectively abandoned for months after its users migrated to another platform. “I just don’t see a whole lot different here,” said Megan Squire, a professor of computer science at Elon University who tracks online extremist groups. “Right now, I don’t think that there’s been much big structural change.” Facebook, for example, has repeatedly made subtle attempts to address individual problems while hand-wringing over large-scale policy decisions. When faced with a growing extremism problem from the anti-government boogaloo movement, the platform initially tried to make the groups harder to find or to restrict certain terms ― a change that many groups quickly found ways of working around. It was only after actions on Facebook were directly linked to real-world violence did the platform announce on Tuesday that it would ban certain boogaloo accounts and label it a dangerous organization. Federal prosecutors in California last month charged two members of the movement in the shooting of two officers working for a contractor of the Federal Protective Service, one of whom died. The criminal complaint said that the two members met on Facebook and posted references to carrying out an attack. One of the two boogaloo supporters was also charged with the killing of a sheriff’s deputy in Santa Cruz, California, and engaging in a shootout with police days later. “We know that hate speech leads to violence, but [platforms] don’t take action until it gets to that point,” Squire said. A closer look at Facebook’s ban on boogaloo groups also reveals that it only targets a specific network that the platform alleges is engaged in violent activity while leaving the wider movement largely untouched. The policy has already led to vague and unclear enforcement, such as removing one major public boogaloo group while leaving its private offshoot untouched. For its part, Facebook said that it has a lengthy and rigorous process to designate groups as dangerous organizations and that it will continue to take action against those who violate its policies. “We are committed to reviewing accounts, groups and pages, including ones currently on Facebook, against our Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy,” a Facebook spokesperson told HuffPost. Platforms have become increasingly sensitive to criticism and bad press over allowing hate speech on their sites in recent years, and most have updated their policies while making efforts to prevent the spread of extremist content. “We have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube, and terminate any channel that repeatedly or egregiously violates those policies,” a YouTube spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. YouTube said it has removed more than 25,000 channels for violating hate speech since implementing a new policy in June 2019. But there have been ongoing enforcement issues when it comes to how platforms police themselves. YouTube, for instance, has continually struggled with preventing child sexual exploitation on its platform. And despite YouTube’s latest ban, several other prominent white nationalists continue to have channels on the platform. Removing and assessing extremism and hate speech can ultimately end up looking like a game of whack-a-mole. “There is always going to be somebody that they’re banning because there’s terrible people out there using these platforms and they don’t get them all at once,” Squire said. “It’s just this constant battle.” Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have also dragged their feet for years over how to address misinformation and racist rhetoric put out by Trump and his campaign, generally carving out broad exceptions for him and other politicians. But Facebook was forced to reevaluate its arrangement last month after Trump posted a threat of violence against anti-racism protesters: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump’s post resulted in an internal uproar and a private phone call between Zuckerberg and the president, The Washington Post reported. The platform ultimately changed its policy to label hate speech from political leaders, although what that policy looks like in practice remains to be seen. Facebook said that Trump’s post would not have qualified for action under the new policy. “They’re kind of on this long, slow slog of defining what they want on the platform,” Squire said. “They’re taking these tiny steps, and we keep running story after story about each of the steps.” The most notable change for the platform in the last few weeks is not the content of Trump’s messaging or the levels of extremism on the platform but the reaction from both employees and advertisers. More than 5,000 employees demanded that Facebook change its policies around political speech after Trump’s threat to protesters, and some staged a virtual walkout. The advertiser boycott, “Stop Hate for Profit,” enlisted major corporations such as Unilever and Verizon. (Verizon owns Verizon Media Group, HuffPost’s parent company.) The boycott caused Facebook to lose $56 billion in market value last week as its stock plunged on Friday, although it has recovered somewhat since then. Even companies that have been more proactive about content moderation than Facebook have ultimately taken uneven actions when it comes to addressing Trump and other far-right misinformation. Twitter has begun putting warning labels on some tweets containing misinformation, including several of Trump’s, although the tweets are still viewable, and it’s unclear what effect such labels have on Trump’s overall messaging. This relatively lax attempt at moderation — essentially flagging outright falsehoods and removing easily definable forms of threats or hate speech — has also generated intense conservative backlash. Many Republicans and right-wing pundits continue to allege that there is anti-conservative bias on platforms, despite ample evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has reportedly been seeking alternatives to major platforms as a means of getting around any moderation at all. It urges followers to download its campaign app and created an unofficial network of sympathetic media to pump out its message. A number of high-profile Republicans and Trump allies also announced in recent weeks that they were joining Parler, an alternative to Twitter that describes itself as “unbiased” and pro-free speech ― despite banning several forms of speech, making users potentially liable for legal fees and retaining the power to ban users whenever it chooses. On Monday, Parler’s CEO, John Matze, responded to people complaining about being banned from the free speech platform with a list of some rules. “You cannot threaten to kill anyone in the comment section,” he wrote.
