1,Opinion: The Violence Of Pride,opinion,"  Shortly before the beginning of Pride month, the mayor of San Francisco ― a city whose metropolitan area has the country’s highest percentage of adults who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender ― announced that she would not march in the city’s annual Pride Parade due to organizers banning uniformed police officers from marching. “One of the central planks of the movement for better policing is a demand that the people who serve in uniform better represent the communities they are policing,” Mayor London Breed said. “We can’t say, ‘We want more Black officers,’ or ‘We want more LGBTQ officers,’ and then treat those officers with disrespect when they actually step up and serve.” Breed isn’t alone here. Any number of Democratic politicians have employed this disingenuous argument when trying to justify a feckless fealty to law enforcement for their own political expediency. For starters, who is “we”? As mayor of a city like San Francisco, I doubt Breed is unaware of the fraught relationship the LGBTQ community has always had with law enforcement. The country’s first Pride marches were organized to commemorate the one-year anniversary of a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a New York City gay bar ― an event remembered today as the 1969 Stonewall Uprising. Pride may garner headlines now from companies like Postmates creating bottom-friendly menus, but it can never be divorced from its origin story of trans women fighting back against police harassment. The group that hosts the city’s march, San Francisco Pride, initially imposed restrictions on uniformed police officers in 2020, following the nationwide protests in response to the murder of George Floyd. A nation saw a Black man tortured and killed, and millions took to the streets to demand our leaders do something about racist law enforcement practices and the broken criminal justice system. Two years later, all that’s been done is an executive order signed after congressional failure to answer a social justice movement. Nothing has fundamentally changed, which is why Pride organizers reinstated the ban, given the safety concerns of marginalized groups within the LGBTQ community. You know ― the Black people who make up a significant portion of the population, no matter what mass media tries to tell the public. It’s not like cops were outright forbidden from Pride events. Officers were encouraged to participate, but urged to wear department T-shirts instead of uniforms. Organizers in Toronto, Vancouver, New York City and Denver also tried to establish boundaries regarding police participation. Breed, like many Democratic politicians who foolishly abandon nuance whenever criticism of the police comes up, is taking a stand for one of the most powerful political forces in America by publicly dissing their most vulnerable counterparts. Worse, she makes the cops and herself sound like the victims. She is playing in people’s faces with this type of argument in this climate. Breed is hardly the first ambitious politician to do this, but it feels all the more insulting coming from a Black person. “LGBTQ people are nearly four times as likely to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault.” LGBTQ people are nearly four times as likely to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault, according to research. LGBTQ people are more likely to be violently victimized both by strangers and by people well known to them. As recently evidenced by the arrest of 31 men tied to a white supremacist group in Idaho that allegedly sought to stage a riot at a local Pride event, the anti-LGBTQ violence that flourished during the Trump administration continues to soar. Much of that has to do with Republicans attacking the LGBTQ community with vilifying rhetoric and targeted legislation. As recently as 2003, LGBTQ people in the U.S. could be jailed simply for acting on their identities, due to sodomy laws and laws regulating gender presentation. These are the kind of laws Republicans want to bring back. I imagine the same goes for the past police practice of infiltrating and attacking LGBTQ community spaces and businesses. Unfortunately, the community can’t always count on the police to protect us. If anything, we can count on them to engage in their own violent actions, rooted in bias, under the pretense of enforcing the law. In spite of advancements in LGBTQ rights, police discrimination against the community has continued through the years, according to the American Bar Association. Per the Innocence Project, this discrimination has led to arrests “based on biased beliefs, influenced investigations, and contributed to the harassment and sexual assault of LGBTQ people by law enforcement officers.” During the demonstrations against police brutality in 2020, activists saw evidence of targeted police violence against queer spaces in states like North Carolina and New York. Transgender people are especially at risk of being killed by police and correctional staff. According to the Anti-Violence Project, trans people are almost four times more likely to experience police violence than cisgender people. Unsurprisingly, the burden is even heavier for Black LGBTQ people. In a Center for American Progress survey conducted in 2020, 33% of Black LGBTQ individuals said they’d experienced discrimination within the past year, and that it had a significant effect on their lives and everyday experiences. Many said they’d changed their behavior to avoid potential harm ― including refraining from travel and keeping away from public spaces such as restaurants and stores. Yes, some law enforcement departments now require LGBTQ training. But last I checked, they’re still killing Black folks after receiving training about that. A cop in uniform is a justifiably terrifying sight for many, regardless of whether the cop is Black, LGBTQ or both. The presence of police can be perceived as menacing because they have functioned, and still function, as a menacing force against the community. Heaven forbid organizers ask them to toss on a T-shirt and let the rainbow clique enjoy their Pride parade free from fear of pepper spray, rubber bullets, tackling, or public execution. London Breed should get over herself and attend the event ― even if she finds herself booed like Mr. NYPD himself, New York Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently jeered at a Brooklyn Pride parade, presumably over his appointments of ministers with histories of homophobic remarks. Adams’ choices, much like Breed’s or those of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (who recently trampled on the notion of presumption of innocence), illustrate the limits of representation when the different faces of power perpetuate the status quo. If Breed is truly an ally to the LGBTQ community, she will change her mind and attend the parade set to take place on June 26. Should she stick to her position, may she never be let off the hook for being so petty about an event where a targeted community asked a collectively unfriendly group to adhere to a less terrifying dress code. "
2,Opinion: The Profit Of Violence,opinion,"  Days after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, a friend sent me a link to a bulletproof backpack insert and a three-page document from the manufacturer. The document offers information about “Training Our Kids for the Next School Shooter.” It shows an image of a school-aged girl in four different poses, demonstrating the many ways a child could use the ballistic insert to shield themselves from the wrath of a crazed gunman. The document lists some do’s and don’ts in the event of an active shooter. Do: find cover, conceal yourself, present a small target, and call or text for help. Do not: carry anything while running, hide in the shooter’s line of sight, or plead for your life. With bulletproof backpack sales skyrocketing after the Uvalde shooting, it is evident that the monetization of fear and grief is nearly as American as school shootings themselves. Still, as a fearful parent and former educator grieving the Uvalde tragedy, I found it hard to consider the $129 bulletproof shield ― which comes in camo, patriotic and school themes ― as anything other than a bargain. Prompted by the link to the ballistic backpack insert, I asked my son to describe a lockdown drill. His teacher turns off the lights, obstructs the doorway and grabs her baseball bat. The children sit against the wall. My son emphasized the importance of everyone being quiet. This checklist, of course, has been seared into the minds of American educators. Having taught elementary special education, I’m not an exception. I tried imagining my son’s teacher, a small woman nearing retirement age, wielding a bat at an unhinged gunman. Just like when I’d imagined myself in that same scenario when I was teaching, the scene did not end well. It never ends well. I was given a hammer in case there was ever an active shooter. My school administrators sent out an email survey at the beginning of the school year asking teachers if they wanted one. As a teacher, I learned not to turn down free things. I checked the “yes” box, but I can remember scoffing at the idea. I have no combat skills and no interest in acquiring any. I am fairly confident I would not be able to overpower an adult storming my classroom on a murder mission. With Republican legislators now wanting teachers to reallocate time from lesson planning to target practice, hammers and bats seem to be giving way to firearms. I left teaching last November after the mounting responsibilities and insatiable demands became too much. I was inspired by all the clichés to teach. I wanted to teach. I loved teaching. But in practice, I was inundated with every possible task and role one could think of that was not teaching. I became an expert at navigating the seething, unwarranted anger from parents who’d bought into the right-wing narrative that teachers were good for nothing, that we lounged around eating bonbons during COVID shutdowns, collecting paychecks funded by the parents’ hard-earned tax dollars. I would get up early to reply to emails sent the night before by flustered parents fearing the “critical race theory” indoctrination of their children. I worked well into the evenings preparing IEPs and lesson plans. To my students, I was never just their teacher. I was counselor, role model, mediator and cheerleader. And then, with a hammer, I was melee combatant. The hammer was problematic, but it wasn’t the problem. Teachers like me are walking away from education in droves. We are not weak or dispassionate. We’re simply coming to realize that we’re being asked to do the impossible at the expense of our mental health, our emotional well-being and, now, our actual, literal lives. In a nation with the highest rate of gun ownership, directly correlating with mass shootings, Republicans have somehow concluded that we should add more guns, and assign teachers the role and responsibility of campus security guards. With the national discourse around arming teachers, I can feel the visceral frustration from when I was teaching bubbling to the surface. Stop asking teachers to do more. Stop asking teachers to subsidize lawmakers’ negligence. Teachers are overburdened, on the brink of irrevocable burnout. Teachers do not want to be school marshals. Teachers do not want bats, hammers or guns. Teachers want solutions. Teachers want to teach. But if the Ohio legislature is any indication, Republicans don’t care about what teachers want. Ohio lawmakers hastily passed House Bill 99 after the Uvalde shooting, granting school boards the ability to permit school staff to conceal carry with a maximum of 24 hours of firearm training. (Police must complete at least 60 hours.) At the mercy of parents and online donations, teachers beg each year for school supplies, wanting to adequately stock their classrooms for young minds eager to learn, but instead of crayons and spiral notebooks, the GOP wants to give them Glocks. With Ohio teachers, parents and others pleading to keep guns out of our classrooms, the passing of House Bill 99, and its signing into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, was an act of hostility. Other Republican-controlled legislatures will almost certainly follow suit. In support of children and education, teachers have made certain humble requests: social-emotional learning, uncensored history and access to books ― all things Republicans have made concerted efforts to oppose. With a growing teacher shortage, Republicans are successfully dismantling the institution of education, one teacher at a time. Of course, the GOP has made no secret of its disdain for teachers and public schools. For years, Republicans have tried to abolish public education under the pretext of “school choice.” Asking teachers to be armed security guards will only exacerbate the teacher shortage. At the Uvalde massacre ― one of the few cases where a militarized police response might have been justified ― the good guys with guns instead tackled, handcuffed and pepper-sprayed parents in distress while a gunman unloaded an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle, killing teachers and children. I’ve seen the video of a panicked Uvalde father being restrained on the ground outside Robb Elementary; I’ve read about a mother who snuck into the school to rescue her two children after she says she was detained by police. I am now certain that teachers are far better at handling crises than law enforcement. That much is evident when hearing Arnulfo Reyes, a fourth grade teacher in Uvalde, share his story about huddling his students under a table, doing his absolute best, and putting faith in the police officers who retreated to safety before the child who called out to them in desperation was executed. Teachers handle crises every day without the false courage of guns or tactical gear, or the power trip of a badge. Still, the question shouldn’t be whether we ought to arm our teachers, but why we haven’t kept guns out of the hands of people capable of committing the most heinous acts of violence. Claiming that any attempt to rein in dangerous disinformation campaigns is in fact a harbinger of an Orwellian dystopia, Republicans are now envisioning a police state for our children, eager to militarize our schools and teachers. The data is concrete, though: More guns translate to more gun deaths, school resource officers are largely ineffective at preventing shootings, and exposing children to firearms increases the risk of gun-related accidents and fatalities. The broad consensus among experts? We should keep guns out of our schools. But how do you reason with people who deliberately misconstrue expertise as elitism and hard science as a leftist scheme for the new world order? The spirit of democracy does not have to accept that all opinions are equal. Some opinions are well supported by facts. Others are well funded by NRA blood money. Uvalde news is beginning to fade into the background of the overwhelming chatter that is American media. Other headlines clutter our news feeds ― Depp Wins Libel Suit; Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration; Sandberg Steps Down From Facebook Parent Company ― as if they shared the same significance as 19 children and two adults slaughtered. Do not be distracted. Let the reactionary lawmakers frantically pushing harmful legislation serve as motivation: This will happen, again. None of us are exempt from America’s gun violence, and arming teachers is not the solution. I haven’t bought the bulletproof backpack insert yet. And I don’t want to. I am, perhaps naively, hoping Republican lawmakers will do the right thing, instead of making parents resort to bulletproofing their children and adding “campus security guard” to the list of roles we expect teachers to play. "
3,Opinion: The Silent Violence Of The South,opinion," A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt. My grandfather was almost killed in a sundown town. I never met him, but I remember my grandmother telling stories of how he would sometimes take cross-country trips. On many of these trips, he might find himself in a town he didn’t know, and he’d have to find lodging before dark, because ― well, he might be in a sundown town. In sundown towns, Black folks were relatively free to roam during the day. But once the sun went down, they were liable to be arrested, beaten and sometimes killed, simply because of the color of their skin. The Oklahoma town where I now live used to be one such place. Sometimes, the founders and leaders of sundown towns would try to rationalize their treatment of people by talking about the menace of crime that followed Black folks. But really, it was just a way to keep people who looked like me in their place. Story has it that one night my grandfather found himself in one of these towns. He had to keep driving for hours until he found a place that would let him stay overnight. He never ran into a police officer, thankfully. If he had, he could have been arrested or killed. That’s the kind of danger that Black people in the American South have historically had to contend with ― and this treatment did not stop with the passing of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s. There were the overt acts of violence, the lynchings and race massacres, that America is only now coming to terms with. But for American people whose skin was kissed by the sun, there have always been other forms of violence as well. There was the sexual violence visited upon Black women that happened so much more often than it was reported. There was the economic violence that pushed Black kids into underfunded and understaffed schools ― and then people wondered why the educational outcomes for those kids were so poor, when in reality, those in power had set the conditions that made it inevitable. But the most pervasive form of violence in the South was what I like to call silent viciousness. Let me explain. My mother was born into a segregated community in southeast Oklahoma. When I was in my middle school years, my mother was in graduate school, and every summer, she sent me to stay with my grandmother, who still lived in that community, so she could study. My cousins and I would run wild in the country those summers, but every time a white person would visit my grandmother’s house, we would have to be quiet and, as my grandmother would say, “act like we had some sense.” If ever we were in a store and came across white people, even ones we did not know, we had to call them “Mr.” or “Miss.” Noticing that we didn’t extend the same courtesy to Black folks, I once asked my grandmother why we had to do that. “Well, baby,” she sighed, leaning back. “That’s just the way things are down here. You’re from the city, so you don’t have to do that up in town. But down here, you’d get slapped, or worse, if you talked to them folks any different.” I didn’t understand what she was trying to tell me then, but I do now. See, somewhere around 1865, after the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, white folks ― sensing they no longer wielded quite as much power as they used to ― created Black codes. “Black people know that if things are upset too much, if they speak out too loudly, physical violence is not far behind.” “All across the South,” notes a report from the Vera Institute of Justice, “Black Codes were passed that outlawed behaviors common to black people, such as ‘walking without a purpose’ or ‘walking at night,’ hunting on Sundays, or settling on public or private land.” These arbitrary laws set the stage for the rampant rate of incarceration for Black men in the South. And even after the end of Jim Crow, there continued to be an order to things. Black folks were in a subservient position, and white people continued their reign of terror. This still shows up in countless forms today. The South has been slow to evolve. The racism of the South follows with it. The violence is embedded in the South; so is the history of loss. There are many ways the American South communicates to Black folks that we are only tolerated, not welcomed. The Confederate monuments, for example: You cannot go to a single Southern state without finding either a monument to a Confederate soldier or a street or building named after a Confederate leader. It might feel, to some, like the Black Lives Matter movement destroyed all traces of America’s Confederate legacy, but that just isn’t true. While the Black uprising helped to bring down or rename some 73 Confederate monuments, more than 700 others remain. Nor does it end there. According to a study from the Southern Poverty Law Center, “there are more roadways (741) honoring Confederates than there are monuments.” And as the report notes, “together with schools (201), counties and municipalities (104), parks (38), buildings (51), holidays (22), military bases (10), commemorative license plates (7), bodies of water (6), and bridges (6), these places do important cultural work to reinforce white supremacy.” The majority of these statues, these reminders of America’s brutality, are in the South, although they can be found elsewhere. Racism is a nationwide problem, but it’s the South that never lets America forget how savage we once were. Many white Southerners continue to vote against their own interests for no other reason than to hurt people of color. The Republicans’ “Southern strategy,” as famously articulated by Lee Atwater in 1981, has worked out well. Republicans knew that if they could get racists to vote for the GOP, they would capture the South for a generation or more. So Atwater, who would later chair the Republican National Committee, laid it plain when he said: You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger” ― that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites ... “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.” Despite all this, Black people in the South were still expected to treat white people with deference, and most Black folks quietly went along. Those who rebelled against this order often became frustrated and left the South, or were labeled as troublemakers. This state of affairs continues to this day in certain small Southern towns. And while this culture of intimidation is not violent on its face, it is supported by the threat of violence indirectly. Black people know that if things are upset too much, if they speak out too loudly, physical violence is not far behind. And that fear of physical violence becomes, itself, another, more insidious form of violence. It leads to altered behavior and second-guessing, a constant sour taste in the back of one’s throat. Knowing that at any moment someone can weaponize their whiteness and self-deputize in order to police Black behavior ― that is violence. In the 1980s, a Black man (whose name I won’t use here, so as not to endanger him anew) became frustrated with the silent viciousness that clouded his life. In Harris, Oklahoma, he refused to call white folks “sir” and “ma’am.” He refused to give white folks the right of way on the road. He refused to water down his words with self-deprecation when addressing them. He was a local basketball star, but he still was beaten to a pulp one summer night because white folks found him too uppity. This silent viciousness is real, and there are ramifications if one steps out of line too far. We have focused so much on police killings, and other forms of overt violence that permeate Black American city life, that we have lost sight of the silent viciousness that colors every waking moment of Black life in the rural South. Sundown towns, Black codes and the silent violence of the South still exist. They thrive in the shadows of night, lurking like a watcher ― waiting for you to step out of line so they can show you how real they still are. A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt."
4,Opinion: American As Violence,opinion," For a second, forget the blood. Forget the decomposed corpses of the Indigenous natives that still fertilize Turtle Island’s amber waves of grain. Unremember the stacks of African bodies that suffocated in feces before the transport vehicles vomited them into the sea. Do not think of the bloodiest war in the history of the North American continent fought to preserve constitutional, color-based human trafficking. The racial terrorism of Reconstruction, the Yellow Peril, the Red Summer, the Black Panthers, Greenwood, Orangeburg, the Ghost Dancers, MOVE headquarters, Standing Rock, Sitting Bull, the Freedom Riders, four little girls in Birmingham, the Jena Six, or the Charleston Nine ― they are all immaterial to this particular conversation. If we are going to talk about America’s rich tradition of violence, we should start at the beginning. We shall start with Jane. Contrary to popular belief, the English expansion into the so-called “New World” was not an experiment in democracy, liberty or religious freedom. The first settlers who landed in what we now call Jamestown were part of the Virginia Company of London. Though their aim was ostensibly to bring “the infidels and savages, living in those parts, to human civility, and to a settled and quiet government,” the wealthy investors’ only real goal was to make a profit off their newly stolen land. There was just one problem: They didn’t know things. They didn’t know how to grow their own food, survive in a foreign land or even avoid fecally contaminated drinking water. The first settlers were so inept, they were flabbergasted when they didn’t find jewels growing on trees and gold washing up on the shore (yes, they actually believed that). Hungry and incompetent, the colonizers depended on the charity of the Indigenous people of the Wahunsenacawh nation for food and provisions. When the natives finally grew tired of the Jamestonians begging for government handouts, the British invaders simply murdered the Wahunsenacawh. Of course, this genocide didn’t help the settlers’ food situation, so while waiting for the pre-colonial version of DoorDash, the British survived the “starving time” by eating horses, dogs and rats, and drinking blood. Eventually, like many churchgoers, they turned to their neighbors. According to researchers, the residents of the first English settlement in the New World resorted to cannibalism. Using a cleaver, they sliced open the head of a 14-year-old Jamestonian ― whom researchers would later call “Jane” ― and ate her brains. America is savage. The Oxford English Dictionary, the most authoritative source on the English language, defines violence as “the exercise of physical force so as to inflict injury on, or cause damage to, persons or property.” It also defines violence as conduct “tending to cause bodily injury or forcibly interfering with personal freedom.” But in America, violence is relative. Most people would consider a government that spends more money on its military than on its health care and education as lacking in “human civility.” But in a nation where there are more guns than gun owners, inflicting harm on others a birthright. In America, health care is not considered part of the “national defense.” In America, “welfare” is a bad word. In this land, violence is entrenched in our national ethos, enshrined in the history, the laws and the very Constitution of this country. That’s not to say the word has no meaning in these disunited states. While condemning Black neighborhoods to underfunded schools, toxic drinking water and overpolicing does not conform to the Americanized definition of violence, we’ve learned that anyone who believes that Black Lives Matter is automatically considered a “savage.” Robbing a bank is violent; the racism embedded in the entirety of the financial industry is not “savage.” Black drug dealers are “violent offenders”; the creators of the war on drugs are not. Capital punishment sentences are overwhelmingly reserved for Black and poor criminals. The wealthiest nation in the world sentencing millions of its citizens to a life of poverty is “capitalism,” not violence. Over the next few weeks, HuffPost will examine the past, present and future of America’s tradition of violence. Lawrence Ware will write about the silent violence of the South and the psycho-emotional damages that still linger today. Former teacher Morgan Stewart will explore the absurdity of normalizing school shootings as if they’re natural disasters. Treva Lindsey will look at the unlivable living violence that Black girls and women face beyond the spectacular. Michael Arceneaux will explain how the overpolicing of the LGBTQ community continues to cause harm. The point of this series is not to redefine words. Instead, we will focus on the actual facts, and the damages caused by this “settled and quiet government” ― because if we, the people of the United States of America, are truly intent on becoming a more perfect union, there are some things we should all believe. Regardless of race, religion or social status, it should be self-evident to each of us that all people are created equal. We should believe that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, we should believe we have the right to alter or abolish it and replace it with the ideas most likely to effect our safety and happiness. We must not let our country cannibalize its citizens, nor can we ever become complacent about the variety of violences inflicted upon our fellow Americans. Do not, for a second, forget the blood. "
5,Black And Brown Stripes On The Pride Flag Aren’t Enough,opinion," Nine months after my breakup, I met up with a mutual friend to observe the occasion of a lunar eclipse by drinking cheap red wine on her deck. She brought out an old box of Christmas lights to wrap around the railing. She looked at me with beaming eyes as she plugged them in, and told me my previous partner had spoken highly about me just a couple weeks earlier. “She said that she never felt as loved and well taken care of as she did when she was with a Black woman.” I glanced up from where I was sitting and debated whether I was going to end the night in a slew of tipsy text-message exchanges reminding all my past lovers and friends that I’m nonbinary. Instead, I poured myself more wine and drank as if it weren’t a weekday. The sentiment seemed harmless, but being Black, queer and femme means you battle the “angry Black woman” trope by day and the “mammy” caricature by night, with little or no space to exist outside of these roles. I wasn’t necessarily offended that people have perceived me as someone who can take care of others and take care of them well. I was more so drained from the broken record that plays in both my relationships and my community organizing work: that I was created to do everything for everyone at all times. While being loved and cared for is important, it’s also important to understand that centering someone’s identity around what they do for others can be complicated. The feelings I have about this aren’t new. Throughout history, Black and brown queer femmes have been the backbone of LGBTQ+ equality movements. But they haven’t been publicly recognized as such in mainstream queer media, and they certainly haven’t been supported or uplifted like they deserve. Marsha Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy were all prominent activists whose protests, riots and advocacy work, during and after the Stonewall Riots, led to the creation of many LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and organizations that still exist today. Over time, organizers and community members have found ways to uplift the femmes from the past who played important roles in equality movements. It’s clear there should be a change in the way we acknowledge queer femmes in this space, but acknowledgement without action and accountability is a dead-end street. In 2020, there was a widespread circulation of images of the Progress Pride flag that artist Daniel Quasar developed in 2018. The flag’s intention was not just to recognize the diversity in our community, but also to pay homage to those Black and Brown femmes who led resistance movements. Reinventing the flag felt necessary, and it especially pulled on our heartstrings that year, as we were knee-deep in the pandemic and news outlets were offering little or no coverage of the alarmingly high rate of trans and gender-nonconforming people who were murdered in 2020. While recognition is an important step, Black and Brown queer femmes in your community today should be appreciated, valued, uplifted and supported in spaces as well. There have been very few times when I was able to navigate spaces without engaging in any community work. Sometimes, it’s because I am open and willing to engage. Other times, people look to me and other femmes to teach them how to be inclusive, how to be an ally or how to understand queer terms and phrases. I often find myself frustrated because I am not allowed to have an “off” button. When I assert my boundaries as an organizer, it confuses people, because we have been told by society that we must always be self-sacrificing. When I first entered the advocacy space at 19, I joked that I was married to the cause. Five years later, it seems like the same cause that I fought so hard for served me divorce papers every year, and their rationale for calling it quits was always that I’ve changed. And that’s not completely untrue. I have changed. Back then, I thought I would come out of the closet, become an activist and change the world. These days, sometimes all I can do is change my sheets. At times, I feel moved by people thanking me for the work I do. But never have I seen society radically engage in protecting Black and brown queer women and femmes. It’s always just us, protecting ourselves. “It’s extremely exhausting,” said Maite Nazario, a nonbinary Guatemalan and Puerto Rican artist and activist based in Atlanta. “I have to be my own voyeur to make sure my words are clear and concise and not read as overly emotional, or even aggressive.” “It takes up so much of my mental space, when in reality the only thing I would like to be focusing my energy on is the rights of my people,” Nazario said. Black and Brown queer femmes are exhausted. They deserve not only recognition for their contributions, but also radical community support ― which can look different for different people. It’s important to ask your organizers what they need. Often, we become so caught up in community that we forget we are community as well, and that we deserve to have some things taken off our shoulders. You should also hold yourself accountable. Do not solely rely on your local queer femme organizers to provide you with research, language and resources. While they can point you in the right direction, it’s important that they take breaks. I find myself constantly playing the role of a spokesperson, and I become severely burned out when people expect me to answer questions around my identity every day. Lastly, prioritize the work that they do, and pay them. I often have flashbacks of my graduate school class last semester, when one of my classmates claimed that “people who do community work probably don’t care about getting money from it.” While organizing in your community may not be a paid position, the fact remains that organizers work tirelessly and should be compensated for the work they do. “Straight up just pay Black and Brown femmes,” says Bri Joy, a performance artist and activist based in New York. “If you have extra funds after paying your bills and rent, you should always, always be setting aside a certain portion of that for Black femmes.” A majority of us will probably spend the rest of our lives devoted to this work, because the work never really stops. I’d like to think that the Marshas and Stormés of today are not dressed in Pride apparel in corporate ads in June, pushing out rainbow capitalism products. Instead, I’d like to think they’re somewhere in the mix of mutual aid initiatives, giving out free condoms and pads and telling folks where they can get affordable gender-affirming care and housing. As your city hosts Pride parades this year, take some time to remember the organizers from the past while actively uplifting and supporting the ones around you. It’s not enough to wait. They deserve their flowers while they are here. We are tired. But we show up. Every. Damn. Time. "
6,"Corporations Say Happy Pride, But For How Much Longer?",opinion," By now, most have noticed it’s that special time of the year when corporations profess solidarity to the LGBTQ+ community by wrapping themselves in a rainbow flag and wishing us “Happy Pride” in an effort to make more money. Based on the wide array of memes going across the internet, it’s nice to know that in the midst of a never-ending plague, others still find humor in the way major companies carry on in June as I do. Not that they don’t make it easy. Like in the case of Burger King Austria, which recently unveiled a “Pride Whopper” under the goal “for equal love and equal rights,” per a translation found on BK’s website. It’s technically the same old whopper ― a flame-grilled beef patty (or the plant-based patty as a substitute), lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo and ketchup ― but the messaging is apparently what makes it infinitely more powerful. “We are setting an example for individuality and freedom and stand for a respectful interaction with each other,” the description on the site continues. “Equal rights. Empathy. Understanding. No matter where you come from, no matter who you love, no matter what you look like or what you believe in: Time to be proud.” What do you get if you add bacon and cheese? I suppose this is at least a more thoughtful corporate caption than the “Homo Estas? Very well, thank you. #LoveWins” tweet we got from Chipotle some years ago. (To be fair, that kind of fits the Chipotle vibe.) And it’s definitely warmer than the “Happy Pride! Here’s 20% off” emails I get from various entities trying to get me to buy things I probably don’t need. The same applies to all of the companies that ask gay creatives like myself to effectively give them free advertising in exchange for nothing (the answer is no, give me money). That’s why fake deep meaning attached to the Whopper aside, to the credit of Burger King, they also donated some money to the cause ― pledging to donate 40 cents from the purchase of every Ch’King sold this month (up to a maximum donation of $250,000) to the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group. Not to count Burger King’s money, but it seems like they could up that figure in addition to giving their employees, many of whom are likely LGBTQ, a boost in pay. Still, I worry that under the wave of rising anti-LGBTQ laws from elected Republicans nationwide, will we end in a situation where corporations won’t even bother to acknowledge us at all, and their collective flops at celebrating the real tenets of Pride Month will fade from public memory. After convincing enough white people that the academic and legal framework known as critical race theory was somehow escaping law schools across America and threatening to pummel white guilt into the precious minds of white kids aged K-eternity to try and win elections in 2021, Republicans have moved on to new targets: every letter in the LGBTQ+ community. The result has been more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills being introduced across the country, including multiple states seeking to ban transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender, and in select states, the outright banning of gender-affirming care for transgender youth where in some cases it would be a felony for doctors to provide such care to minors. There is also the passage of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which limits the restrictions on teaching LGBTQ topics in schools. In the lead up to its passage and signing it into law, Ron DeSantis accused his critics of supporting “sexualizing kids in kindergarten.” (Similarly, the man he models himself on politically, former President Donald Trump, jumped on the rhetoric and likened teaching kids about gender and pronouns to “child abuse.”) More recently, Republican Texas State Representative Bryan Slaton announced he will file legislation to ban drag shows in the presence of minors. As utterly stupid as such legislation sounds, the homophobic and transphobic sentiments behind such proposals can’t be understated. And as much as queer and trans people and their supporters are being labeled as predators, it’s only Republicans proposing to inspect the genitals of female high school and college athletes. The rhetoric has not necessarily shifted public opinion yet, as evidenced by a poll released in April by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, that found, overall, Americans lean slightly toward expanding discussions of sexuality in K-12 classrooms. But I take issue with political observers, who argue that it’s only a matter of time before today’s anti-LGBTQ rhetoric stops working in Republicans’ favor. They don’t appear to know how their country works. Not all of us can afford to exist in such a bubble. We’re presently living in a political climate where the nation is awaiting a Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority to strip abortion rights for millions of women. During the confirmation hearing of Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators like John Coryn of Texas questioned her about marriage equality ― suggesting that is the next target should Roe be overturned. Even before all of this started happening, anti-LGBTQ violence rose dramatically under the Trump administration. I understand that ever since Trump found his way into the White House, there has been too much chaos to keep up with in the news cycle on a given day, but it’s hard to ignore the pattern of white Christian nationalism informing much of the GOP’s talking points then, or now. The same applies to their rising authoritative impulse, or in the case of Ron DeSantis, who is using his power as Florida’s governor to punish people for the sake of launching a presidential bid, fascist kink. Disney did the right thing by listening to its employees and issuing a statement against DeSantis’ cruel “Don’t Say Gay” bill, but his response was to revoke the company’s special tax status. He has since repeated that method of retaliation on the Tampa Bay Rays for their support of gun safety reform. Far be it from me to not have a lot of faith in the name of businesses that typically place profit above all, but should DeSantis find his way into the White House, it is likely he will continue this practice and use the powers of the federal government to bring corporations to heel. I don’t think most would put up that kind of fight under such pressures. Already, some are caving under the pressure of Republicans making the LGBTQ community its favorite new punching bag. State Farm, for example, dropped its support for a program providing LGBTQ-theme children’s books to teachers and libraries after complaints from conservatives. “This program that included books about gender identity was intended to promote inclusivity,” Victor Terry, State Farm’s chief diversity officer, reportedly wrote in an email to staff. “We will no longer support that program,” he said, adding that “conversations about gender and identity should happen at home with parents.” The program, which would see agents and staffers distribute books to community centers, libraries and teachers, aimed to “increase representation of LGBTQ+ books and support our communities in having challenging, important and empowering conversations with children age 5+.” Programs that benefit people like me, a gay author. It is offensive for anyone to buy into the notion that any mere mention of us points to some kind of perversion. And it really sucks for people who now need to consider getting a less intolerant car insurance company. There are other comments from American CEOs that give other causes for concern, but ultimately, the issue is a major political party that has made a target out of one community, and not only are major media outlets ignoring it or dismissing it as a “culture war,” the other major political party seems ill-prepared to lead any type of proper push back. Meanwhile, Marjorie Taylor Greene means it when she says she wants Pride month to end to save straight people. I don’t place my value or sense of pride in whether or not a major corporation validates me by way of a cheesy nod and other lackluster offerings, but without real pushback from the public, corporations ― who the Supreme Court told us are people ― may end up no longer feeling safe to even try. "
7,Opinion: Paul Ryan Is The Wrong Person To Make A Good Point,opinion," I never believed Paul Ryan to be as remarkable as he was once touted in select circles before his political career was tossed in the trash during the Trump era, but even failed leaders can make somewhat of a decent point about our political climate. Recently, the Republican former speaker of the House complained about “entertainer politicians” during an appearance on CNBC’s ”Squawk Box.” “In the ‘old days,’ like 10 years ago, if you wanted to do really well in Congress, if you wanted to succeed, you climbed a meritocracy,” Ryan explained. “The measurement of success was policy and persuasion.” Meritocracy is a figment of majorly white male imagination, but his underlying point about how many nationally known politicians operate in our current era in order to gain prominence should not be completely discounted. “You persuade your colleagues, your country, your constituents: ‘This is the right way to go. Here’s the solution,’” Ryan explained to host Rebecca Quick. “That’s not necessarily what motivates people anymore. There’s a lot of entertainers in Congress on both parties.” Now, he complained, you can “just leapfrog that whole process, be a really good entertainer, have an incredible presence, digital, and forget about policymaking and curate a brand for yourself.” I imagine Ryan is referring to more contemporary Republican figures in the House such as Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), her partner in idiocy, Matt Gaetz (Fla.), and the no-less-awful Paul Gosar (Ariz.). Greene, the most famous, was initially known as the “QAnon candidate” and has since gained a national following for essentially howling at the moon about how horrible other people are. A recent example of this is Greene’s assertion that Pride Month must be abolished because, if we allow the rainbow flags to keep flying, eventually straight people will become extinct. “Probably in about four or five generations, no one will be straight anymore,” Greene tweeted. “Everyone will be either gay or trans or nonconforming or whatever the list of 50 or 60 different options there are.” Greene based this on the false claim that the gunman who fatally shot 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, last month was a “cross-dressing loner.” She also, presumably, pulled from her long-standing ignorance and bigotry. After that ridiculous claim, she earned more headlines for making the argument that Canada’s proposed gun control legislation would invite a Russian invasion, calling out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Trudeau foolishly completely ignores how taking guns away from his people makes his country weak and vulnerable to being invaded and easily taken over by another stronger country,” she alleged on Twitter. “Like, perhaps Russia, who is very angry at America right now.” No matter how asinine Greene sounds on a given day, as a creature of social media — or more pointedly, an online cult — Greene has been rewarded for not knowing anything for many of the reasons outlined by Ryan: lots of money, more headlines, and plenty of exposure across social media. Yes, despite claims like these — along with other controversial incidents such as being accused of making thinly veiled threats toward trans people and Democrats — to Ryan’s point, Greene has been rewarded. In fact, should Republicans take control of the House in November’s midterm elections, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who desperately wants Ryan’s old job, will probably hand Greene a committee to run. As has been reported, it appears McCarthy understands there’s no stopping members such as Greene and Gosar — including that time the two were spotted at a gathering of white nationalists hosted by the outspoken Holocaust denier, antisemitic, homophobic and racist activist Nick Fuentes — so you might as well give them what they want in exchange for power. Never mind how vile and stupid they show themselves to be. Paul Ryan grasps that this new political culture is a problem, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. “If you are going to entertain, if you are going to try to show that you’re better than everyone else within your own ecosystem” it makes it more difficult to compromise and forge policy, he noted. It “divides us,” Ryan explained. I’m all for complaining about entertainer politicians, but not in the context of it being a problem for bipartisanship. Given what Paul Ryan professes about the virtues of meritocracy, I’m not surprised he blabbed a bunch of nothing about how important bipartisanship is. However, unless you took ”The West Wing” too seriously, bipartisanship doesn’t matter as much as the fact that selfish people who just want clout and campaign contributions have an entire ecosystem to benefit from sabotaging the country. Meanwhile, to say that it’s “both parties” is disingenuous, which is probably why Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ignored the advice Ryan gave her in 2019: “Take it easy, just watch things for a while, don’t ruffle any — see how it works first.” Ocasio-Cortez has gained a national following because she passionately speaks about issues that matter to the Democratic base. Additionally, she has shown herself to be a sharp questioner during hearings and someone that will also call out members of her own party when need be. Complaints of her celebrity are unwarranted given that she is someone at least trying to be good at her job. Republicans tend to stand in the way of progress generally, but thanks to the political ascension of Donald Trump, catapulted by his ability to use his skills as an entertainer to feed the Republican base the racism, sexism and xenophobia that’s long been part of the GOP’s id, the problem has gotten much worse. There is now a template to duplicate on a smaller level. Ryan ignores his own role in helping make this mess, which makes his criticisms register as incomplete (if not phony). Ryan used to be applauded by members of a press corps dominated by people that look like him because he read Ayn Rand and worked out. Ryan often coasted on the reputation of being a policy wonk yet often simply trafficked in the same racist talking points most American politicians of stature employ to get ahead. Ryan may have delivered his ugliness in sharper sentences than the dense politicians he refuses to call out by name, but that is not unlike the people he now complains about. In assessing Ryan when he was House speaker, The New York Times’ editorial board wrote: “If he is the policy wonk of the Republican Party, then the Republican Party has no policy.” The most he ever did in Congress was pass a tax cut for the rich, and after doing so under Trump, whose racism and idiocy he defended when it proved politically beneficial, Ryan left to become a board member for Fox News’ parent company. Now Ryan is criticizing other Republicans for behaving as cowardly and feckless as he used to, claiming House Republicans would have voted to impeach Trump if they’d had the “guts.” It did not take long for the reportedly “bored” Trump to respond: “Did anyone notice that Fox News went lame (bad!) when weak RINO Paul Ryan, who is despised in the Great State of Wisconsin for being ‘a pathetic loser,’ went on the Fox Board.” The offensive use of quotations notwithstanding, I can at least acknowledge that there is something lame and pathetic about a person who spent most of his career cowering to whatever interests would help him net power then decided to sit on high and whine about other people doing the same thing. While I’m glad someone of stature is speaking about the celebrity problem, when you sit on the board of the company responsible for giving do-nothing politicians a place to perform, the least you could do is note past mistakes in these diatribes. But if you choose to say nothing about it, you can’t be taken that seriously. Perhaps the real problem is that Paul Ryan is upset that, after spending 20 years in Congress, he finds himself out of power and relevancy because the game he’s used to has changed. This doesn’t make Ryan wrong to at least speak up, but he remains the wrong person to make the right argument. Here’s hoping someone not as flawed will follow in his footsteps because, if nothing else, I am tired of our politicians clowning and trolling their way to more power. "
8,Opinion: Herschel Walker Doesn’t Know Anything,opinion," I’m not sure if Herschel Walker can form a single coherent sentence about any policy, but some of us are more generous than others when it comes to accessing the skillsets and capabilities of the Georgia Republican senatorial candidate. Speaking to Politico, Brian Robinson, a Republican consultant in Georgia, said of Walker: “He doesn’t speak in beautiful syntax, by any means, but, you know, I think his voters will say what they said about Trump quite often, ‘Well, I know what he was trying to say.’” Is this why political consultants get paid so much? Robinson’s generosity is almost adorably hilarious. Much as it pains me to write this, ineloquent and generally stupid as Donald Trump is, he is at least an entertainer that can parrot the talking points he consumes hour after hour on conservative TV stations. Being a racist celebrity that heavily trafficked in the habits of white supremacy did wonders for Trump politically. However, Walker’s performance is far less convincing based on the way the former NFL running back has offered nonsensical answers on a variety of policy issues over the last few months. Take his recent appearance on “Fox & Friends,” where he stumbled on how to curb mass shootings in the wake of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left at least 19 children and two adults dead. “We need to get into what happened to him, why, by putting money in mental health. Have people thought about that?” Walker said, referring to the 18-year-old Uvalde gunman. “We’ve gotta get back into prayer. People thinking now praying is bad. No, it’s not bad. We need to pray for things like that. We need to continue to go out and fight, continue to take your constitutional rights away, and I think we can’t do that.” I imagine plenty of folks do think the chorus of MC Hammer’s “Pray” is the only viable option, but what would Jesus do? Presumably be in favor of passing gun safety legislation. However, when co-host Brian Kilmeade asked Walker where he stands on gun control measures such as universal background checks or raising the age to buy assault weapons from 18 to 21, more verbal stumbling came. “Well, you know, it’s always been an issue, because as I said earlier on, they wanna score political points ... People see that it’s a person wielding that weapon, you know, Cain killed Abel,” Walker explained. “And that’s the problem that we have. And I said, what we need to do is look into how we can stop those things.” He continued: “You talk about doing a disinformation, what about getting a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women, that’s looking at their social media? What about doing that, looking into things like that, and we can stop that that way?” I won’t even pretend to know what this man is referring to, but note that Walker then suggested “putting money into other departments rather than the department that’s wanting to take away your right” only to not specify any agency. I suppose it was better than the previous answer Walker gave to CNN: “What I like to do is see it and everything and stuff.” And to be fair, this is technically no less asinine than Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy telling Vice News that we can’t ban assault weapons because people need to kill feral hogs. “If you talk to the people that own it, killing feral pigs in the, whatever, the middle of Louisiana. They’ll wonder: ‘Why would you take it away from me?’” Cassidy explained. Still, in addition to that rambling answer about gun safety, Walker has struggled to answer reporter questions about the bipartisan infrastructure bill and evolution. On the latter issue, Walker spoke of the Bible, and claimed, “If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it.” I’ve thought about it, and this is a testament to the legacy of Trump: Dumb men who don’t know anything managing to potentially exploit their celebrity and various strains of prejudice to net positions of power. Walker did not participate in any GOP primary debates and was criticized about it by many of his opponents. “Herschel Walker is afraid to debate, he has skipped five debates. There’s been an empty podium at every one of them,” GOP U.S. Senate candidate Latham Saddler said during the campaign. When asked why, Walker told WJCL 22 News: “One of the things we’ve got to do is get out and meet the people. In a debate, what do you ask, three to four questions? One of the things I have been doing is going around the state of Georgia talking to people, that’s the reason I think I am up in the polls.” Walker won because he’s famous and a famous bigot boosted his campaign. As nice as that must be for him, it’s embarrassing that Senator Raphael Warnock — to me, one of the most impressive senators to surface in a very long time — is going to face such a difficult reelection bid against someone so uninformed and deceitful and allegedly abusive. Walker’s ex-wife sought a protective order against him in 2005, claiming he was violent and controlling. At least Warnock now has an opportunity to further highlight Walker’s lack of knowledge about the job he is seeking after challenging Walker to three debates this fall. “Herschel very much looks forward to debating Raphael Warnock and his lock-step support for Joe Biden’s disastrous policies this fall,” said Walker’s campaign spokesperson, Mallory Blount. The Walker campaign has not confirmed the number of debates that he will attend, but apparently he is getting help from the likes of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who recently visited him at his campaign HQ. Gingrich says the two talked about “everything from being a candidate to being a senator to thinking about debating Warnock and how to handle debates.” Walker’s habit of turning to wretched bigots for political guidance makes it difficult to see him as anything besides a GOP prop. Walker would tell you differently, though, professing to be “mad” at Trump for claiming credit for pushing him towards a Senate bid. “One thing that people don’t know is President Trump never asked me,” Walker said in an interview with Killer Mike on Revolt TV. “I need to tell him that he never asked. I heard it all on television that ‘he’s going to ask Herschel,’ saying Hershel is going to run. President Trump never came out and said, ‘Herschel, will you run for that Senate seat?’” “So, I’m mad at him, because he never asked, but he’s taking credit that he asked,” Walker added. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Walker boasted of a 37-year “deep personal friendship” with Trump, defended him against claims of racism and said it “hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald.” Around this same time and in the months after, Trump continuously teased Walker running for Senate in Georgia. Trump doesn’t have to ask for something he publicly pushes; the message is clear. Walker can now potentially coast his way to the Senate, but if he’s yearning to prove he knows what a U.S. senator actually does and why he wants to be one now, it’s time for him to figure out how to string words and statements together by fall. Warnock is the first Black man elected as senator of Georgia and should not be replaced by a fool intending to waste space. "
9,OPINION: What President Biden And The Dems Could Learn From Beto O’Rourke,opinion," Given that their ideology is largely rooted in maximum profit and the oppression of others, I don’t think Republicans are actually capable of shame. But that doesn’t mean Democrats shouldn’t at least try to make them feel bad for the way they are — least of all when it involves policy positions that help facilitate the mass murdering of elementary school children. Those that stand in the way of less pain and suffering don’t deserve civility; they deserve to be confronted with the anger their callousness calls for. Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke recently offered a glimpse into how motivating righteous indignation can be while confronting Gov. Greg Abbott at a press conference related to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. “This is on you,” O’Rourke reportedly yelled after moving to the third row of Uvalde High School’s auditorium about 15 minutes after the governor began speaking to the media alongside other state and local leaders onstage. After Abbott concluded his comments, O’Rourke continued. “You are doing nothing,” O’Rourke added. “You are offering up nothing. You said this was not predictable. This was totally predictable when you choose not to do anything.” After O’Rourke was eventually escorted out of the room, he turned back to address Abbott again. “This is on you until you choose to do something different,” O’Rourke explained. “This will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.” This earned O’Rourke criticism from the likes of Sen. Ted Cruz, who described O’Rourke’s passionate remarks as a “stunt,” and Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, who said, “I can’t believe that you’re a sick son of a bitch that would come to a deal like this to make a political issue.” Cruz is a pathetic man willing to debase himself in pursuit of his unattainable goal of the presidency. As for McLaughlin, he sounds rather dense complaining about politics being invoked to discuss a societal ill rooted in bad political policy. And he is presently defending a police department and police chief that, with each passing news cycle, look to be involved in some kind of cover-up over their failures. That’s more than enough reason to set his opinions on fire in your mind. Look at the people of Uvalde themselves, who appear to be just as angry as Beto. On Sunday, Abbott was booed during a Sunday visit to the Uvalde memorial. Of course he was. This is the man responsible for an 18-year-old being able to legally purchase an AR-15 to begin with. Moreover, this is not his first mass shooting as governor. Instead of passing meaningful gun safety laws after the El Paso massacre, Abbott opted instead to form a “domestic terror” task force. How many mass shootings will it take for elected officials to stop pretending the cops will stop this problem? “If given the chance, Abbott and Republicans in Congress will simply delay action until we collectively switch to some other national issue. They have to be confronted.” Even now, Abbott won’t call for a special legislative session in light of the shooting. On Wednesday, he urged the Texas Legislature to form special committees to make legislative recommendations in response to the Uvalde school shooting. Abbott told his fellow Republicans that the state “must reassess the twin issues of school safety and mass violence.” They already know what to do. They just don’t want to do it. This is why Beto O’Rourke confronted Abbott the way we did. If given the chance, Abbott and Republicans in Congress will simply delay action until we collectively switch to some other national issue. They have to be confronted. It’s why I appreciate O’Rourke and others like Texas Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde and told CNN this week: “If I do nothing for the rest of my career but yell at Greg Abbott and others that are not willing to listen, then that’s what I’m going to do. We must have change.” Now, juxtapose their comments with those of President Joe Biden on Monday when speaking about gun control negotiations. “McConnell is a rational Republican,” Biden claimed. “Cornyn is as well.” I understand that Biden is of a particular era in which politicians got along so well that he could even compliment a segregationist senator, but it is one that is bygone. It is beyond time for Biden to adjust. Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn and the rest of those Republicans in the Senate don’t give a damn about how many people die from gun violence. If they truly did, laws would have changed by now. Any rational person would recognize this and convey to voters their willingness to sacrifice lies in the pursuit of power accordingly. I wish Biden had mirrored Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s anger, which she expressed in a new interview with The Cut. “It’s also been 10 years since the tragedy in Sandy Hook, when politicians committed to passing sensible gun legislation,” Warren said. “And guns are now the leading cause of death for young people. How do our elected officials not have a plan? This mirrors the anger Warren expressed after the Supreme Court leak that previewed a looming decision to overturn Roe v. Wade — taking to the streets with protesters. “I am angry,” Warren shouted over a megaphone. “We are not going back!” Warren has a right to be angry. As do the millions of women and men that will be impacted once abortion rights are restricted by the court. Yet Biden himself only released a statement that day. True enough, while at the Uvalde memorial, Biden said “we will” in response to a crowd screaming “do something.” But listen to the urgency in the voices of the victims of bad policy and compare it to the lack of urgency you hear from most of the politicians responsible for changing it. I’m not sure if the Uvalde school shooting will change the gubernatorial race in Texas, but if nothing else, at least O’Rourke can say that his campaign genuinely fought for the change needed in the state. That actually motivates people to care. Complimenting the people who are helping more Americans die in order to get more money from the gun lobby does not. According to NBC News, Biden is “rattled by his sinking approval ratings and is looking to regain voters’ confidence that he can provide the sure-handed leadership he promised during the campaign.” If the president wants to regain voters’ confidence and keep control of Congress, he needs to not solely rely on being the mourner-in-chief or the great statesman. You can’t go anywhere in America and not fear being shot to death. As president, you need to do something about it, or at the bare minimum, at least sound like you’re really trying. "
10,Opinion: Why I Don’t Care About The Uvalde Shooter’s Life And You Shouldn’t Either,opinion," Opinion Editor Twelve hours after a gunman walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 students and two adults, I learned that he was “lonely” and “bullied” for a stutter and a lisp. I learned that the 18-year-old mass murderer used to play video games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. I learned that the monster at one point used a knife to cut his own face. I learned that on his 18th birthday he purchased two assault rifles that he took photos of and posted online with the caption “my guns.” And I don’t care. I don’t care that he had a tough upbringing. I don’t care that middle school was difficult for him. I don’t care that he struggled to make friends. This is not because I lack sympathy. It’s because all my sympathy is used up on the carnage he left behind. I care that Jacklyn Jaylen Cazares, 10, had the whole world in front of her and that she would help anyone who needed it. I care about her cousin Annabelle Rodriguez, also 10, who was killed in the massacre with her. And he, whose name I will not mention in this piece because he will not gain infamy from my story in death, doesn’t get to do this. Just because you’ve had it tough, you don’t get to inflict pain and misery onto the rest of the world. “He was the nicest kid, the most shyest kid. He just needed to break out of his shell,” his friend told The Washington Post. Fuck that guy. You know who else was a nice kid? Eight-year-old Uziyah Garcia, whose grandfather described him as “the sweetest little boy that I’ve ever known.” And fourth grader Xavier Lopez, 10, who was the life of the party at all his family’s barbecues and had received his honor roll certificate just hours before he was killed. I care about Eva Mireles, the teacher who died a hero protecting her students. For 17 years, Mireles taught the fourth grade out of pure love for her students. And I know this because my mother taught for 50 years and still has trouble paying her mortgage. There’s no money in teaching. Teachers are paid in smiles, hugs and mugs with silly sayings. It’s a barter system most of us will never understand and a love that many of us will never experience. And I don’t need to know if she shielded a child on the day she died: She was a hero 17 years ago when she walked to the front of her classroom, grossly underpaid, and gathered those tiny faces’ attention. I don’t care about monsters. Monsters destroy. Monsters leave wreckage in their wake. Monsters gorge until there is nothing left but sadness and pain. The media needs to stop trying to make men out of monsters. Not everyone is redeemable. Sometimes what it looks like is exactly what it is. Sometimes evil wins. I don’t ever need to know that the Buffalo mass shooter had a toothache. I don’t ever need to see the Sandy Hook shooter’s drawings or notebooks, or go back to the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter’s home so that his father can say, “I don’t know what happened, I just know that the boy wasn’t raised that way.” He was. He wasn’t. I don’t care. Once a life intrudes on another in the most violent way, finding out what that life was before that moment doesn’t matter. I don’t believe that monsters are afforded the rights of people. They don’t get to be redeemed. There is no need for reflection on the life they lived up until that point. They are monsters. But for some reason, America wants to study them; it wants to know who they were before that day. Why? What difference does it make? Has it gotten us closer to understanding what makes them hate-filled and callous? Has it worked to curb the violence? If the goal isn’t to paint the monster in a more humanistic light, then why bother learning who they were before they attacked and unloaded their pain onto others? In October 2017, columnists for Slate argued against my beliefs. In a piece titled “We Need to Humanize Shooters,” Elizabeth Adetiba and Jake Bittle argued that by not giving air to their stories we aren’t learning what makes them who they are and thus are stopped from preventing acts like this in the future. They write: But responding to these harmful characterizations by saying that we must label mass shooters like [Las Vegas shooter Stephen] Paddock as “evil” and shun all information about their motives or struggles is course-correcting in the wrong direction. The truth, difficult as it may be to accept, is that societal influences play as much of a role in perpetuating mass shootings as they do in local, small-scale shootings. The magnitude of mass shootings makes the intentions behind them more difficult to comprehend, but these shooters are also products of a society that is notoriously apathetic toward more quotidian acts of violence. While I agree that societal influences definitely play a part in the dejection and isolation that seems to be consistent in the mass-shooter profile, I don’t know what knowing that after the shooter has murdered innocent victims helps us to understand. Everyone is dejected and isolated at some point in life, but that doesn’t mean that any of us are going to commit mass murder. We would have to have precognition levels of insight to determine who has the propensity for this level of violence. But we can stop lionizing shooters and rehashing their past with a sympathetic bent. If we must look at shooters past then it’s best we take our cue from this 2019 Los Angeles Times op-ed and use researchers’ exhaustive look at every mass shooting since 1966 as the template. The authors found four common themes. The first was that the majority of shooters have experienced childhood trauma, and as a result have mental health issues. The second is that in the weeks or months leading up to the shooting, almost all of them had experienced some kind of crisis that led to their breaking point. The third is the most intrusive and telling: that almost all of them studied other shooters, and in the information age, many were radicalized online. Finally, all of the shooters found ways to carry out their plans, from finding the location to securing a weapon. These findings tell us much more than knowing that the Uvalde shooter missed large portions of school and wasn’t on track to graduate. Other than learning whether or not the shooter has died after the shooting or has lived and will face justice, I don’t need to know anything else about them, nor do I care. The best thing to come out of the Uvalde shooting was learning that the monster was dead. The family of those who lost loved ones that day will not have to be further terrorized like those in the Buffalo supermarket shooting who will have the see the monster’s face every time he goes to court. You don’t get to take away 19 of the most vulnerable among us and two adults who loved them like family and tell us after the tragedy, after the remains, after the devastation, how tough you’ve had it. Because at that point I don’t care. And the media needs to stop caring too. Opinion Editor"
11,OPINION: Weapons Like The Ones I Saw In Iraq Were Used In The Uvalde Mass Shooting,opinion," I served two combat tours in Iraq. I never thought I would see weapons in my community reminiscent of the type that my Marines and I used on the battlefield. Yet here we are, again. Nineteen children and three adults dead in another senseless act of gun violence in my home state of Texas. I am heartbroken. I am frustrated. I am seething. This tragedy comes only 10 days after a racially motivated mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, that killed 10 people. Nearly a decade after 20 first-graders and six adults were murdered in Newtown, Connecticut. I mourn with the victims’ families and stand in solidarity with Uvalde, a small, predominantly Hispanic town 85 miles west of San Antonio. As a gun owner and a veteran, I understand the many reasons to possess a firearm. I do not comprehend our leaders’ inability to enact bipartisan gun safety reform. Especially with the breakneck rate at which these horrific events continue to rip our neighborhoods, families and country apart. FBI data reveals an upward trend in the frequency of mass shootings and killing sprees that span multiple locations. The FBI designated 61 active shooter events in 2021, a 50% increase from the previous year. When will it end? When will Congress act? The shooting in Uvalde is the most recent reminder that our society values gun ownership more than education. More than mental health services. More than innocent human lives. I support two pieces of legislation that Tony Gonzales, the incumbent representing Uvalde in Congress, voted against: the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the Violence Against Women Act, which contain common-sense solutions to prevent guns from falling into the hands of those who aim to commit violence. Without measures to prevent gun violence or prohibit the mentally unstable from accessing a firearm, it is only a matter of time before another community is thrust into the national spotlight. We need to reconfigure our priorities. We need to limit access to combat weapons, and we need to hold our leaders in office accountable for their failure to ensure that our communities are safe places to live, work, shop, pray and study. “The shooting in Uvalde is the most recent reminder that our society values gun ownership more than education. More than mental health services. More than innocent human lives.” The FBI defines a mass shooting as an event with three or more casualties. There have been eight mass shootings in Texas since 2009. Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz are scheduled to speak on Friday at the National Rifle Association’s 2022 annual meeting. Will they acknowledge that the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history at a Sutherland Springs church happened on their watch? Or that the El Paso shopping center shooting in which 23 people were killed took place almost two years later, also during their tenure? If Texas had adopted extreme risk laws, the massacre in Uvalde might have been thwarted. Under this policy, if someone displays signs that they may intend to harm themselves or others, their weapons can be temporarily seized. Nineteen states have enacted this proven, evidence-based, life-saving measure. Why not Texas? The gunman posted multiple photos of his weapons days before his rampage. I recognize the pain the people of Uvalde are feeling. As a father, I cannot imagine sending my daughter to school in the morning and never seeing her again. Uvalde is a tight-knit, minority-majority community of modest means. I come from a working-class Latino family. When a family loses a loved one, it is devastating for everyone. Twenty-three families are reeling from unimaginable grief. Today we mourn. Tomorrow we fight for gun safety reform so that no more families suffer the same fate. "
12,Opinion: Karine Jean-Pierre Can Do America A Favor And Stop Calling On Fox News,opinion," Karine Jean-Pierre, the new White House press secretary, knows the difference between herself and every single one of her predecessors. “I am obviously acutely aware that my presence at this podium represents a few firsts. I am a Black, gay, immigrant woman — the first of all three of those to hold this position,” she told reporters at the start of her first official briefing earlier this month. “If it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me, I would not be here.” Jean-Pierre went on to say that “representation matters” and celebrated President Joe Biden for having “the most diverse administration in history.” Indeed, he does, but visibility only goes so far. While it is true that Biden can tout a number of historic shifts in terms of personnel, his administration has also worked feverishly to restore a number of political norms — including engaging with those openly hostile to many of the communities Jean-Pierre belongs to. Discussing her old boss and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s departure to MSNBC, Jean-Pierre told the Los Angeles Times, “We’re going to miss her so much.” I won’t. I recognize that many people enjoyed Psaki’s exchanges with Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy, but I always found them irritating. Doocy often poses leading and asinine questions when presented with the opportunity to speak, and for the life of me, I have never understood why this administration bothered to reward his idiocy with airtime — especially when you consider his place of employment. Sure, some people loved their lil’ tit-for-tat outbursts across social media and select cable news channels because of Psaki’s snarky retorts — which fans called “Psaki bombs” — but they just gave further legitimacy to the racist propaganda vehicle poorly masquerading as a news outlet. Even more grating is that, for all the coverage of their “tense exchanges,” Psaki and Doccy seemed to think quite well of each other in the end, as evidenced by them playing nice at the end of Psaki’s tenure. It’s not as if I am advocating for Pskai to have stood at the podium and cursed Doocy out every single day, but he works for a place that vilifies Black people, the LGBTQ community and immigrants. Considering that Jean-Pierre was Psaki’s No. 2 and that Black people collectively had a lot to do with Biden’s election victory in 2020, how could anyone justify the spectacle that ultimately gave cover to a network that has helped ruin the country? Psaki and the whitewashed mainstream media outlets championing this schtick could treat it like a game — because what Fox News does one way or another doesn’t impact them the way it can impact folks like me and Jean-Pierre. “While it is true that Biden can tout a number of historic shifts in terms of personnel, his administration has also worked feverishly to restore a number of political norms — including engaging with those openly hostile to many of the communities Jean-Pierre belongs to.” As for those “Psaki bombs,” for whatever grief people thought Psaki gave Doocy — when I think of times she actually tried to bring reporters to heel, I recall the condescending way she fielded questions from PBS’s Yamiche Alcindor about the White House’s views on Haitian immigrants and the resignation of U.S. diplomat to Haiti Daniel Foote during a press briefing last September. A more recent example is when a reporter asked about Israeli police beating mourners with batons at the funeral procession for Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian American journalist and veteran correspondent at Al Jazeera shot dead by Israeli forces while she was reporting on a military raid in the West Bank. Psaki said it’s not the role of the U.S. to “assess or analyze the politics on the ground in Israel.” I can guess at least one reason Psaki answered the last question the way she did, but generally, the frustrations many marginalized communities have about the Biden administration paying lip service to their concerns were exemplified by the tone of the White House spokeswoman. Psaki is an effective communicator, but what she often communicated may not have necessarily aided the Biden administration, according to its poll numbers and its loss of support from its most vital constituencies. Jean-Pierre has an opportunity to help provide the shift the administration needs as we move toward the midterm elections and Biden’s looming reelection bid. Jean-Pierre should start by ignoring Fox employees altogether. She did not do that on her first day — opting to engage with Doocy, as Psaki did. It went about as well as expected. Doocy asked the disingenuous question, “How does raising taxes on corporations lower the cost of gas, the cost of a used car, the cost of food, for everyday Americans?” Some pundits have already criticized Jean-Pierre’s response for inefficiency, but no answer would have been sufficient for Doocy or the network he works for. By engaging him, Jean-Pierre fell into the trap of taking an unserious network seriously and garnering negative headlines for herself and the administration. That is and always will be a lose-lose situation for Jean-Pierre, but it’s not too late to change course. Fox’s biggest star, Tucker Carlson, has already given her plenty of reasons to go to her bosses with such a request. Upon the announcement of Jean-Pierre’s new role, Carlson declared that the administration had found someone as “shallow, nasty and partisan” as Psaki. Unsurprisingly, he then questioned Jean-Pierre’s job qualifications. “Karine Jean-Pierre is our first out LGBTQ+ White House press secretary and that’s all you need to know,” Carlson said. “It’s a good thing, shut up and celebrate. That’s why she got the job. She’s in the right group, and to the Biden administration, which thinks exclusively in terms of groups and never in terms of individuals, because individuals are messy and inconvenient, the group is all that matters.” “Show us your picture and we’ll tell you if you’re qualified for the job,” Carlson added. That’s rich, coming from someone born into wealth and privilege who failed on multiple cable news networks until he tapped more deeply into his racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia — but it is a perfect example of why Jean-Pierre should ignore all requests from Fox for airtime. Carlson will only get worse. So will Laura Ingraham. So will the sycophants that host ”Fox & Friends.” As will all of the other goofy, nonsensical, batshit-crazy people hired over there. They’re going to call her racist and brand her unqualified no matter how she responds to them, so why even bother? That time can be spent on a Spanish-language network, a Black media outlet or an LGBTQ outlet. It should not be lost on anyone that after Jean-Pierre talked about her historic appointment and its significance, she proceeded to field questions from reporters about the teenage white supremacist who staged a mass shooting at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store that left 10 people dead and three others wounded. In the days after, many of those reporters and the media outlets they work for have already moved on from the story — a testament to how much attention a predominately white political press cares about Black people being hunted in America. It is a climate that Fox helped create and further perpetuates. So, as much as a barrier-breaking choice for White House press secretary matters, what she does with her platform matters as much, if not more. There is no need to continue to help those who stoke animus for profit and sport, in tandem with a bigoted political party, gain further legitimacy. They want to live in their world devoid of facts. Karine Jean-Pierre and the administration she now speaks for ought to let them. "
13,Opinion: I’ve Reached The Fifth Stage Of Grief After America’s Latest Mass Shooting,opinion," Opinion Editor On Friday, July 20, 2012, James E. Holmes walked into an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater and purchased a ticket. He then walked to an emergency exit, propped the door open, walked outside, grabbed weapons from his car, walked back into the movie theater and began shooting. I couldn’t believe it. Having once dreamed of writing movies, I often went to the movies alone. Not because I was a loner but because I wanted to study films in silence. I didn’t want to be bothered with questions or snacks. Hearing that a gunman had burst into a movie theater and began shooting at anyone who was in the theater wasn’t just insane to me, it was difficult to digest. I had to identify out; this was in Colorado, a bazillion miles away from Greenbelt, Maryland, where I often went to see movies. This was some crazy white guy, doing crazy white guy stuff. It would never happen here. 12 dead; 70 injured. Then Aaron Alexis happened. Alexis was a former Navy aviation electrician’s mate who had been honorably discharged after several run-ins with the law. In one of those instances, Alexis “blacked out” during an argument, pulled out a gun and shot the man’s tires out. On Monday, Sept. 16, 2013, Alexis drove his rented Toyota Prius down to the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., wearing a shoulder bag that contained a disassembled shotgun. He walked into Building 4 and then up to the fourth floor, where he’d been working as a contractor, and slipped into a bathroom where he assembled the shotgun, and then slipped back onto the floor and opened fire. Whatever I’d forced myself to believe about mass shootings had been shattered. This happened in my backyard. No longer could I hold on to the myth I’d created about this being a fringe white man crime as Alexis was Black. I know it sounds stupid even as I write it, but it’s true. I’d comforted myself creating mass shootings as a disgruntled, embattled white male aggression that would only happen should I wander down to Capitol Hill. I never wandered down to Capitol Hill. 13 dead; 8 injured. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen walked into a back entrance to Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on “Latin Night” around last call and began opening fire. Within five minutes, he let off some 200 rounds. There was a standoff between the police and Mateen. Mateen claimed that the attack was a response to the killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq a month before. After three hours of negotiations, Mateen was shot and killed by Orlando Police. Consider this: Pulse had to exist because the community that the club serves is so marginalized that they have to create a safe meeting place for those in it. Now consider that, inside that club, there is another group so marginalized that they have to have their own night. That was who was killed during this shooting; people who were already bargaining for their existence to matter. People who were so marginalized that they were just happy to have a Sunday to themselves, together. People who left their homes thinking, like all of us, that this night had the potential to be the best night of their lives. Instead, it became the second deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history since 9/11. 49 dead; 53 injured. That was until Oct. 1, 2017, when Stephen Paddock, a man from Mesquite, Nevada, went to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas and from his 32nd-floor window in the Mandalay Bay Hotel opened fire. Depression is an easy state to manifest but a hard state to leave. It doesn’t happen overnight, but over time. Once you realize that the weight has become heavy, it’s usually too hard to lift on your own. It wears you down until sleep becomes refuge, air becomes inconsequential, food becomes optional. 60 dead; 411 injured. My father used to tell me this story. I don’t know if it’s his or not, but it goes like this: If you want to break an elephant, you have to get them when they are babies, and you tie a heavy weight to their legs; say around 200 pounds. No matter how hard they pull they won’t be able to move that weight. You leave that weight on them long enough and over time they’ll just give up. So it won’t matter when the elephant grows to weigh several tons — all you have to do is break out that weight and tie it back to their legs. The elephant will believe that they are stuck. They won’t even try to escape. “It’s exhausting to know that all of the above shootings happened in only a five-year span. They were all national news. All taxing. All came with politician promises and thoughts and prayers.” That’s where I am now. Much like depression, I didn’t just get here. It takes time to become disconnected from hope. You don’t just decide that the fight is pointless; you have to get beaten up for 10 rounds until you can’t see straight and then you give up the fight. On Saturday, May 14, a gunman wearing a helmet camera and body armor pulled up outside a Tops Friendly Market and opened fire. He walked the aisles of the supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, looking for Black people to kill. At one point in the livestream he broadcast to streaming site Twitch, the gunman sees a white person hiding near the checkout and aims the gun at him before realizing that the man is white. The gunman can be heard saying, “Sorry!” before stalking away looking for more Black bodies. It’s exhausting to know that all of the above shootings happened in only a five-year span. They were all national news. All taxing. All came with politician promises and thoughts and prayers. Then, nothing happened. Nothing changed. No legislative fixes, no national ban on automatic weapons or body armor. Nothing. America is more committed to guns than they are to people. That is a fact. That’s not arguable. That’s not debatable. That’s what it is and it’s time we all accept it. In order to understand America’s history with gun violence, we have to understand America’s history with guns and the law. It was a few years before the start of prohibition, back when America was still trying to act like it didn’t have a drinking problem, that the Tommy gun was invented. In 1918, John Thompson created the first lightweight submachine gun that could fire multiple rounds without having to stop and reload. This first-of-its-kind, fully automatic gun was initially marketed to police, but as with most things, it didn’t take long for the gun to find its way into the hands of gangsters. On Feb. 14, 1929, America experienced what was up until then one of its deadliest shootings. Four men, all dressed as police officers, walked into a notorious Chicago street gang’s garage and opened fire. When the dust settled, seven members of George “Bugs” Moran’s crew had been killed. In 1934, some five years after the Valentine’s Day Massacre, Congress had Karl Frederick, the then-president of the National Rifle Association, come testify as to whether a federal gun control law would violate the Second Amendment. Frederick’s answer was bullshit, but Congress did decide to pass the first federal gun control law in American history: The National Firearms Act of 1934, which was basically a $200 tax (which was a large amount of money for the time) to prevent the transfer of said weapons. That went about as well as expected. Technology would improve upon the original design. Guns would get better, faster and could hold more ammunition. People kept dying. And here we are, some 90 years later, and America is still pandering to the NRA. The only Constitutional amendment that seems to be irrefutably and unabashedly upheld is the Second Amendment; and mass shootings are just about as American as NASA and Nike sneakers. I have accepted that America is perfectly fine with mass shootings, as difficult as that is for me to write. It doesn’t mean that I’m not sympathetic to those families suffering right now. I am. I feel for them. I can’t imagine what they must be going through. But I would be lying if I didn’t point out that we’ve seen this all before. We’ve seen Democrats arguing for stricter gun laws and Republicans claiming that the onus is on mental health. We’ve seen the newscasters swarming on the devastated areas. We’ve seen all of the compassion and empty promises of change — and then nothing. Not one legislative change. Not one fundamental push for common-sense gun laws. I remember after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida — you know, the shooting that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene believes was staged — that there was a push for teachers to be armed and demand for bulletproof book bags soared. America doesn’t want to end mass shootings because ending mass shootings would require doing something beyond lip service. As we’ve made it clear over and over again, we’re not going to do anything about gun violence because our politicians have decided that the right to own and operate a gun is more sacred than the right of others to live free of bullet holes. We could hold shooters, gun makers, killers responsible. We could hold ourselves accountable, but we don’t want to because it might upset someone who owns a gun, and we all know that all gun owners clearly matter. All lives? No. Black lives? Definitely not. But the gun. Won’t someone think of the gun, a weapon created to kill? That may sound deranged, but that is what we have decided as a body politic. Why else would this keep happening? 10 dead; 3 injured. Opinion Editor"
14,Opinion: The Buffalo Shooter Is A Product Of The Republican Party,opinion," A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt. Over the weekend, a young white man drove several hours from where he lived, put on army fatigues and a helmet, and walked into a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, where he livestreamed himself shooting 13 people, killing 10 of them. So often when these things happen, we jump to analysis and lose sight of the people whose lives were taken. I will not do that. We must not lose sight of the men and women who were killed. I will name each one of them below — and I urge those who see these words to read each name: Not long after the massacre, authorities discovered an anti-Black manifesto posted by the shooter, identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron, filled with racist ideas known colloquially as the “great replacement” theory — an idea developed by French philosopher Renaud Camus holding that white people are being systematically replaced by immigrants. However, the theory is a malleable one, and has been expanded by extremists to include anyone who is not white. It became clear from the gunman’s 180-page manifesto that his intent was to kill as many Black people as possible because he felt that Black people were replacing white folks in America. Once he was done with Black people, his plan was to move on to other races and ethnic demographics. This is the same theory that inspired Robert Bowers to kill 11 people in Pittsburgh in 2018; Brenton Tarrant to kill 51 people in New Zealand in 2019, and Patrick Crusius to kill 23 people in El Paso, Texas, in 2019. They all cited some version of replacement theory as motivation behind their actions. It would be one thing if this idea was a fringe one, eschewed by politicians and media members alike, but it isn’t. In fact, many prominent Republicans, both in Congress and on Fox News, have openly embraced a version of the theory unapologetically. Just this week, Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), the third-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, said this in a tweet: Democrats desperately want wide open borders and mass amnesty for illegals allowing them to vote. Like the vast majority of Americans, Republicans want to secure our borders and protect election integrity. Now, I cannot say for certain if she knew that she was spouting replacement theory ideology or not, but not long after the tweet, she noted that she’s “never made a racist comment” and that she’s “known nationally as expanding the Republican Party by supporting Black candidates and Hispanic candidates” — seemingly trying to distance herself from the ideas that are in line with the Buffalo shooter. Tucker Carlson, the host of the most-watched cable news show among adults age 25-54, has long  been a proponent of the great replacement theory. In fact, when you put Carlson’s words side-by-side with the Buffalo shooter’s, it is uncanny how similar they are. Tucker, Tucker, Buffalo shooter pic.twitter.com/Z4jcOJSUmf Let’s cut to the chase. The Republican Party has embraced the same kind of nationalistic, racist and evil ideas that inspire killers around the world to target Black and brown people. There was once a time when Republican leaders could say with honesty that they were shocked and appalled when events like what happened on Saturday happened. Yet, their stance on gun control and their embrace of a neutered version of the “great replacement” theory make their calls for peace and prayer ring hollow. Just days after the shooting, Senate Republicans have already come out to claim that gun reform is not the answer. “It just doesn’t seem to be helpful to me to go after law-abiding citizens and our Second Amendment rights, so I’m going to continue to hold that position,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told The Hill Tuesday. “I think I heard a Black person from Buffalo on television say that guns don’t kill, people kill. So what are you going to accomplish by gun control?” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told the outlet. “Particularly, if it’s a violation of the Second Amendment?” It’s amazing the level of disdain that Republicans have for dead Americans. Making guns harder to get is a simple fix that Republicans won’t even consider because they’re complicit in these acts. While they may not argue for mass killings, they aren’t doing anything to stop them. The divisive rhetoric and lax gun laws embolden those who take their fears of a less white America literally. Already, media outlets have begun to spin the narrative around this shooting. They consistently call the shooter a teen — thereby painting the doer of these evil, hateful crimes as someone young and worthy of sympathy. We know what comes next. They will dig into his background, and learn that he was a loner who was probably bullied, making this monster out to be not evil, just misunderstood. This is what they will do for Gendron, the white man charged with murder. Something that was not done for Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin or Antwon Rose — all Black boys killed by police or vigilantes. In the wake of their deaths, all of them were discussed like they were adults. What will be afforded Payton in life was never given to Black children, even in death. I’ve grown weary of living in a country run by narcissistic racists who feel that they can say what they please as long as their poll and ratings numbers remain up. Buffalo shows us definitively that words and ideas have consequences, and if people like Tucker Carlson and Elise Stefanik continue to use their platforms to spew ideas rooted in hate, then I will have to look long and hard at the people who watch Carlson and remain a part of the party of Stefanik and count you not as a person who merely wants lower taxes, but, instead, as a person who is hostile to the presence of Black and brown people in this country. Time is up for quietly putting up with racist ideas. It cost 10 people their lives in Buffalo, 10 people whose names I will never forget. A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt."
15,Opinion: Forcing Pregnancy Is A Form Of Rape. It Will Be Our Reality If Roe v. Wade Is Gone.,opinion," My subconscious registered my first vaginal delivery as a rape. Unlike my abortion at 22, my pregnancy at 32 years old was planned. All of the paternalistic boxes were checked this time. I was married, healthy, low-risk, fully insured, and ecstatic. I looked forward to a labor and delivery that was blissful and worry-free, but as a survivor of sexual assault, my body associated the experience of spreading my legs unceremoniously while succumbing to momentum and pain beyond my control as a violent act that would culminate in anguish. Instead of pushing when my cervix was fully dilated, I froze. For the next three hours, my daughter was crowned. As the top of her infant-sized head protruded two inches from my torn vagina, I vaguely remember the obstetrician, who appeared to be standing at the far end of a dark and distant tunnel, showing me my daughter’s “beautiful curly hair” on a mirror she held between my splayed open knees. She must have done this a dozen times, and then — “Push, Drew, push,” the attending nurse pleaded. “Don’t you want to meet your daughter with that pretty curly hair?” she asked hopefully. But I was gone. In the childbirth classes I’d taken in the months leading up to my daughter’s due date, I was told to imagine I was on a beach when the labor pains became overwhelming. What my childbirth instructor didn’t know — and frankly, what I didn’t fully grasp at the time — is that as a survivor of sexual trauma, my capacity to dissociate or “check out” when under extreme stress could take me far beyond an imaginary beach. The violent throes of childbirth terrified me, so I left my body and became catatonic. I did not “imagine I was on a beach.” I dissociated and froze. For more than three hours, I was unable to move. It wasn’t until I heard my obstetrician say to someone in the increasingly tense delivery room, “We’re going to have to try a C-section, but because the baby is crowned, we might lose her,” that I snapped out of my trance. Something clicked. Although the jolting trauma of labor felt like life or death for me, I realized that this was a life-or-death moment for my child. In an instant, a different version of myself emerged; the fighter. Game on. Let’s do this. Within minutes, I pushed my daughter out of my body. Her beautiful tiny face was red and kind of smashed, but she was fine. We both survived. “I am not entirely surprised by this most recent deprivation of liberty or reckless endangerment of women’s lives.” Two years later, when it was time to deliver my son, I understood the assignment. This time I was mentally prepared for the commitment required of me as a person giving birth, which I describe to those who haven’t experienced it as taking a jump shot at the buzzer when you’re injured and exhausted from playing all 48 minutes of a basketball game, or like finding the back of the net in a penalty kick 90 minutes into a soccer match. Giving birth requires intention and focus. Every cell in your body must engage. So when it was time to deliver my son, I summoned the grit of the athlete I used to be in high school (basketball, power forward, fierce rebounder) and pushed him out in 19 minutes. It was almost all-net; my vagina only tore in one place this time. And again, we both survived, which was no foregone conclusion. As a Black woman, I faced a risk of death due to pregnancy that is three times higher than the risk of maternal mortality faced by my white counterparts. Can you imagine being forced to take such a profound risk? Can you imagine being compelled to engage in that kind of gutting labor against your will? If the leaked draft opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that would overturn Roe v. Wade becomes final, millions of people in a land that has the audacity to call itself free will be forced to do exactly that. The abolishment of abortion is a hijacking of the bodies of millions of women and girls. This development would be more shocking to me if I were not a descendant of enslaved people in America. I have never been deluded into believing I am safe in this country because I occupy a Black female body. The story of Black women and girls in America does not begin on a pedestal; it begins on a slave auction block. It wasn’t even necessary for a white man to be a sexual predator to rape my enslaved female ancestors for centuries in this country. He merely had to be an industrious entrepreneur — because for hundreds of years in America, impregnating Black women by rape was a matter of course; a good business decision. So I am not entirely surprised by this most recent deprivation of liberty or reckless endangerment of women’s lives. Sadly, it tracks in a country that was an apartheid state for hundreds of years before it became a democracy. And, even then, it was a democracy that only included land-owning white men for more than a century. Indeed, the callous disregard for the bodily autonomy of women, especially Black women and girls, is “deeply rooted” in the American history that Justice Alito nostalgically invokes in the leaked draft. To underscore his contempt for my gender, Alito resurrects the views of Sir Matthew Hale in his argument for overturning Roe v. Wade, which is a particularly alarming choice. An English jurist born in 1609 — 10 years before the first ships bearing human cargo in the transatlantic slave trade scraped onto America’s shores— Hale was an extreme misogynist even by 17th century standards. Hale once sentenced a 13-year-old girl to hang for witchcraft. And, as rape and incest exceptions for abortion restrictions hang in the balance, it is worth noting that Hale believed the “matrimonial contract” made it impossible for a husband to rape his wife. So, in its drafted decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court cited a man who sanctioned the plunder of all women, including white women, on their matrimonial pedestals. The message to all childbearing people in America is clear: None of us are safe. From rape to reproduction, toxic men seek unfettered dominion over the bodies and lives of women and girls. As a survivor, I’m repulsed by the prospect of forcing people to remain pregnant, which I regard as a form of sexual assault. As a citizen, I’m outraged by the notion of forced labor, which is, by definition, slavery. So I’m determined to resist this regressive lurch back in time so that my daughter and my son will grow up in a country where all of us are free. Need help?

16,"Don’t Be Stingy, President Biden. Forgive As Much Student Loan Debt As Possible.",opinion," After months of being pressured by members of his own party, President Joe Biden recently revealed that he is “taking a hard look” into forgiving some federal student loan debt ― only perhaps not nearly as much as some have called for. “I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction. But I’m in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness.” As for how long that “hard look” will take in terms of his decision making, Biden said he would have an answer on forgiving additional debt in the “next couple of weeks.” The remarks came days after separate reports surfaced that Biden expressed a similar sentiment during a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting, explained that Biden never mentioned a specific amount he was looking to cancel, but noted the president claimed, “You’re going to like what I do.” That remains to be seen, but as someone that has suffered greatly under the weight of federal and private student loan debt since graduating from college, I hope Biden not only uses this time to give it real consideration, but to not allow stinginess to be his guiding light should he proceed with cancellation plans. Of course, Biden never made student loan debt a central theme of his campaign the way Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) did in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, but their policy proposals to eliminate either all or significant portions of student loan debt prompted then-candidate Biden to pledge to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for every borrower. Thus far as president, Biden has implemented various rounds of targeted student loan forgiveness to a small group of borrowers that has eliminated about $16 billion in federal student loans. Yes, that’s more than any previous president, but when 45 million Americans carry a total of $1.7 trillion in student loan debt, forgiving less than 1% rightly feels like a paltry sum. After all, student loan debt is the second-largest debt held by Americans, behind mortgages. Biden has repeatedly extended a freeze on student loan payments and that has helped roughly 41 million borrowers save $5 billion in interest payments a month per the Education Department. That pandemic-era pause on federal student loan payments will last through August 31, but since 2021, the administration has said it was studying the legality of Biden’s ability to cancel debt through executive action, yet has repeatedly failed to release the long awaited memo. It’s one of many reasons why I, like others who care deeply about student loan debt and its impact on millions of Americans, have wondered if the Biden administration was planning to string borrowers along. It’s nice to know that Biden will finally be giving Americans an answer in due time, but it’s been frustrating watching this administration take such a blasé attitude towards the sort of issue that would rally the kind of voters Biden needs most to show up in both the midterms and his looming reelection bid. In a recent Harvard University poll, 85% of a total of 2,024 18-to-29-year-olds surveyed said they favor some form of government action on student loan debt. A separate national tracking poll from Morning Consult and Politico shows how approximately 64% of the 2,000 registered voters collectively support at least some amount of student loan forgiveness. An Economist and YouGov poll from January found that nearly half of all Americans and 70% of Democrats support forgiving student loan debt from public colleges and universities while another poll from Student Borrower Protection Center and Data for Progress found that 75% of Black likely voters and 80% of Latino likely voters support government canceling some-to-all student debt. It’s already a popular issue, so if President Biden offered a coherent message on the importance of debt forgiveness and sold it as a means to lift millions of Americans out of needless struggle, I believe he could only increase the popularity of debt cancellation and benefit politically. Besides, with respect to the Democratic base, Biden owes Black voters more than he’s offered thus far and this is one way to make a more meaningful impact in a tangible way. According to a 2020 NAACP report, among 2016 graduates, almost 40% of Black students left college with $30,000 or more in debt, compared with 29% of white students, 23% of Hispanic students and 18% of Asian students. And according to a 2016 Brookings report, the average Black graduate owes $52,726 four years after graduation compared with $28,006 for the average white graduate. A 2019 study found that $50,000 of federal student loan cancellation would eliminate all student debt for 93% of Black low-income households. Black women in particular are disproportionately impacted by student loan debt, and although the freeze in payments has helped ease some of that burden, cancellation would make an even greater impact. As Warren recently explained in a New York Times op-ed, debt cancellation “would help the millions of female borrowers who shoulder about two-thirds of all student loan debt, and for Black and Hispanic borrowers, a higher percentage of whom take on debt to attend college compared to white students, and have a harder time paying it off after school.” Not only would this be the right thing for Biden to do on principle, it could also help him begin to atone for his own role in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act ― a law that made it impossible to declare bankruptcy on certain types of credit card debt and all student loan debt. Biden defended his role in the bill during the primary debate, but I align with Sanders’ assessment of the bill that it “was a very, very bad bill.” And as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) previously said, “It’s outrageous that other people get to declare bankruptcy but students can’t.” Though not everyone may align with the viewpoints of these Democratic senators, their arguments against student loan debt still fail to impress. Sen. Mitt Romney has suggested “desperate polls call for desperate measures” as the reason for Biden wanting to forgive student loan debt and claimed the move would constitute a “bribe.” “Other bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages? And put a wealth tax on the super-rich to pay for it all,” he tweeted. Romney forgot to include medical debt, but this sort of argument is to be expected from someone born into privilege and earned from profit via work in private equity. The same can be said for Fox News’ Laura Ingraham who also argued in a tweet against student loan forgiveness because her mom had to work into her 70s to pay for her to attend college. “My mom worked as a waitress until she was 73 to help pay for our college, even helped with loan repayment. Loan forgiveness is just another insult to those who play by the rules.” Ingraham is a famous racist whose own brother has condemned her. The “rules” are made for despicable people like her to benefit. And unshocking as it is that she believes everyone should suffer like her mama allegedly did, no one should mirror that type of selfishness. Biden needs to ignore conservatives and rich people from his own party, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), on student loan debt cancellation and think of the people suffering. For many struggling with student loan debt, it not only impacts their ability to buy a home, start a business, move for a new job opportunity or start a family, it also contributes to their mental health and behavior. In a new study released in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers say student loan debt can impact heart health. I wrote an entire book on how my student loan debt impacted every facet of my life. How at my lowest points, suicide was never the option as some feared for me because I was too aware of the reality that my mom would still be on the hook for my private loan debt as a co-signer. I don’t share the selfish attitude that because I had to suffer, everyone else should. I have not benefited from the pause in federal student loan payments. I will not qualify for any of Biden’s potential cancellation options. I want student loan debt forgiveness all the same because I would never wish that misery on anyone else. In a new analysis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that canceling $50,0000 in student loan debt would forgive the full balance for almost 30 million federal student loan borrowers, with an average forgiveness of more than $23,800 per borrower ― at a cost of $904 billion. For comparison, U.S. military spending amounted to $801 billion in 2021. So as Biden weighs his options on debt cancellation, if all else fails, perhaps he can be convinced to look at student loan debt cancellation as a war he can win with a shift in priorities and the stroke of a pen.
