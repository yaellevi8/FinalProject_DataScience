1,Congress Has Just Days To Extend A Crucial School Summer Lunch Program,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost A federal program meant to ensure low-income kids are still fed in the summer when school lunches aren’t available is set to be hobbled after June 30. Now Congress is making a last-minute dash to keep that from happening. Lawmakers are yearning to get out of Washington for a two-week Fourth of July holiday break, a recess likely to give momentum to a bipartisan gun safety deal made in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, mass shootings last month. But that same last-week-of-school atmosphere may also help, or potentially kill, a deal to keep the summer meal program from serving fewer kids at least into the fall. “We have a bipartisan bill,” Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told reporters Wednesday. He said that it could come to the House floor as early as Thursday and that he hoped to bring it up under a process used for non-controversial bills but which requires a two-thirds majority for passage. Without action, many kids — a House panel estimated “millions” — would face reduced access to food if there are more restrictive conditions and eligibility requirements. Some meal sites would have to close, the ability to pick up meals to go would end and parents would be required to fill out eligibility paperwork that largely disappeared during the pandemic. The tightened conditions would return because waivers are set to expire June 30. The waivers had been extended in 2021 in a government funding bill but another extension, which could have been included in a funding bill in March, was left out amid concerns over the cost and extending again what opponents said were meant to be temporary pandemic measures. But late Tuesday, mindful of the looming deadline and the recess, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee said they’d reached agreement on another extension and found a way to pay for it, using unspent COVID money. “While the country is on the road to recovery, many schools are still struggling with supply chain shortages and other increased costs that will make it more difficult to serve meals next year. This bill provides additional assistance to ensure that students can get the nutrition they need to help them learn and grow,” said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), chair of the House Education and Labor Committee. “This budget-neutral legislation will also put our country’s school nutrition programs back on the right track and keep the permanent pandemic narrative from being used to expand school meal programs beyond their intended purpose,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.), the top-ranking Republican on the panel. It’s unclear exactly how many children would be affected by the expiration of the waivers, but House Democrats on the Education and Labor Committee put it in the millions. The deal could still be undone by intransigence in the Senate. With senators champing at the bit to leave town, any senator opposing the deal could force a drawn-out consideration of the extension bill, delaying a vote until late in the week when many lawmakers will want to be on their way home. And Politico reported at least one Republican, Sen. Roger Marshall (Kan.), was threatening to hold up the deal over guidance from the Agriculture Department, which administers the program, banning discrimination over LGBTQ status in food programs that get federal dollars, which includes most school lunch programs. Hoyer, though, was optimistic. “It has broad, broad agreement, this waiver between now and Sept. 30,” he said. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Arkansas’ Israel Boycott Pledge Law Upheld By Appeals Court,politics," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

3,The Child Care Crisis Needs A Lot More Attention Than It's Getting,politics," Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe. This past week has been full of news, including the Jan. 6 hearings and bipartisan agreement on a gun violence bill. The Supreme Court handed down a major decision on church and state, with landmark rulings on guns and abortion coming soon ― maybe even this week. HuffPost has been all over these stories if you need to catch up. I’d especially recommend last week’s series imagining a post-Roe America ― including Alanna Vagianos on how conservatives are trying to cut off access to abortion pills, Travis Waldron on the connections between anti-abortion and anti-democracy movements, and Nathalie Baptiste on the disproportionate impact abortion bans have on Black women. But for today’s newsletter, I’d like to write about something else that really should be getting more coverage: the crisis in American child care, which is causing tangible, serious hardship for millions of parents and their kids. About one in three families with young children encountered “serious problems” finding child care last year, according to a survey that came out in October. And there’s plenty of other data out there just like it. I’m familiar with child care because I’ve covered the issue for a decade, plus I’ve been the working parent of young children. But a story I saw on Tuesday got my attention in a way few have recently. It involved a scene from a chain café, a passage from Jane Addams’ memoir and a stateside episode from World War II. The story was in a Medium post by John Duong, who leads the venture capital arm of a higher education foundation. While working at a neighborhood café, he spotted a young girl asleep in a booth. She looked 2, maybe 3 years old, Duong wrote. He figured her mom or dad was in the restroom. Later he realized that her father worked there and had brought her to work, checking on her every now and then ― presumably, because he didn’t have or couldn’t afford child care. I say “presumably” because Duong didn’t get the backstory, so there’s no way to be sure. But the scene made me think immediately of two periods in U.S. history when this kind of thing was common. One was the early 20th century, when families in the big cities for factory work would leave their kids alone, frequently at home and unsupervised ― in other words, they didn’t even have a parent checking on them regularly the way the dad in the café was. Jane Addams, writing in her memoir “Twenty Years at Hull-House,” recounted what happened to three children she met in Chicago: “One had fallen out of a third-story window, another had been burned, and the third had a curved spine due to the fact that for three years he had been tied all day long to the leg of the kitchen table, only released at noon by his older brother who hastily ran in from a neighboring factory to share his lunch with him.” The other historical antecedent was during World War II, when women were working in factories while men were fighting overseas. “Stories of children locked in cars adjacent to factories, chained to temporary trailer homes, and left in movie theaters quickly filled newspapers and eventually became the subject of congressional hearings,” Chris Herbst, a professor of public affairs at Arizona State University, explained in a 2017 paper about the Lanham Act, which set up a network of government-run child care centers. The Lanham program might have become the basis for a permanent national system, if only the federal government had kept it going. But it didn’t. The next and really only serious attempt to create a national plan took place in 1971, when Congress passed a bipartisan bill that President Richard Nixon vetoed following opposition from conservatives. That has left U.S parents struggling, in a way that their counterparts in peer countries don’t. But politicians barely noticed ― until relatively recently. Child care got serious attention in the 2016 presidential campaign (from Hillary Clinton) and again in 2020 (from all the top Democratic presidential candidates). It also was the focus of a sweeping proposal that Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Md.) developed and then promoted with the help of outside advocacy groups. Then the pandemic hit. At first, working parents couldn’t find child care because providers had to shut down. Later, as child care providers started opening up again, they couldn’t hire enough workers. The root of the problem is that child care salaries are notoriously low, making the jobs less attractive; at the same time, providers don’t have the money to raise salaries, because they’re already charging as much if not more than many parents can afford. It felt like exactly the sort of political conditions it would take to pass significant legislation ― and, for much of 2021, it seemed like that would happen. President Joe Biden made child care (and caregiving more generally) a chief focus of his “Build Back Better” agenda. Democratic leaders included a version of the Murray-Scott proposal in the legislation. We all know what happened to that bill: It died in December when Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said it was too big, depriving Democrats of the 50th vote they needed. Democrats have been quietly (and, lately, not so quietly) working to save some portion of that legislation, but so far there’s not a lot of public talk about including child care in the bill. It’s difficult to separate out the failure of the original child care proposal from the failure of the original Build Back Better ― which, depending on your perspective, is the fault of Manchin, Democratic leaders, broader political constraints including unanimous Republican opposition, or some combination of those factors. But two other factors were obviously important too. One is that enacting any kind of notable welfare state expansion in the U.S. is extraordinarily difficult, both because the structural design of the U.S. legislative process deters it and because public faith in government is at historic lows. The other is that child care is still seen by many as a “women’s problem” ― which in a sense is accurate, because women typically shoulder responsibility for child care disproportionately ― and men still hold disproportionate power in Washington. That seems to be changing, slowly, as women gain more influence. It’s no coincidence that this latest effort happened at a time when the House speaker, chair of the relevant Senate committee and vice president were all women ― and that the president happened to be a man who, unusually for men of his generation, has lots of experience as a caregiver for his children. Some kind of child care legislation could still happen. Murray recently partnered with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on a more modest initiative that could squeeze into whatever legislation Biden and Democratic leaders get through this year ― or maybe even be the basis of a future bipartisan bill. A new study out this week by Herbst and a group of colleagues showed it could significantly lower child care costs for most families. But nothing is going to happen if child care remains a second- or third-tier issue. It’s going to take more attention from politicians and, ultimately, more attention from the public. Maybe stories like the one about the little girl in the café can help make that happen. Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

5,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
6,"James Rado, Co-Creator Of Groundbreaking Musical ‘Hair,’ Dead At 90",politics," NEW YORK (AP) — James Rado, co-creator of the groundbreaking hippie musical “Hair,” which celebrated protest, pot and free love and paved the way for the sound of rock on Broadway, has died. He was 90. Rado died Tuesday night in New York City of cardio respiratory arrest, according to friend and publicist Merle Frimark. “Hair,” which has a story and lyrics by Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot, was the first rock musical on Broadway, the first Broadway show to feature full nudity and the first to feature a same-sex kiss. “Hair” made possible other rock musicals like “Jesus Christ Superstar” and “Rent.” Like “Hamilton,” it was one of only a handful of Broadway shows in the past few decades to find its songs on the pop charts. The so-called “American tribal love-rock musical,” had its world premiere at the Public Theater in New York City’s East Village in 1967 and transferred the following year to Broadway, where the musical ran more than 1,800 performances. Rado played Claude, a young man about to be drafted and sent to the war in Vietnam. Clive Barnes, theater critic for The New York Times, called the show “the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.” The New York Post said it had “unintentional charm,” contagious high spirits and a “young zestfulness” that “make it difficult to resist.” Variety, however, called it “loony.” It lost the Tony in 1969 to the more traditional “1776” but won a Grammy Award. The 2009 revival won the best revival Tony. The show was revived on Broadway in 1977 and again in 2009. It was made into a movie directed by Milos Forman in 1979 starring Treat Williams and Beverly D’Angelo. “Hair” spawned four top four singles on the American pop charts, including the No. 1 hit “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” by the Fifth Dimension, which won the Grammy Award for record of the year and best pop vocal performance by a group in 1970. Others included “Hair” by the Cowsills, “Good Morning, Starshine” by the singer Oliver and “Easy to Be Hard” by Three Dog Night. The cast album itself stayed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks “Hair” tells the story of Claude and Berger, best buddies who find freedom in the late 1960s. Between draft-card burnings, love-ins, bad LSD trips and a parade of protest marches, the two wander through a New York filled with flower children, drugged-out hippies and outraged tourists who don’t approve of the wild goings-on. In one song, Claude poignantly sings, “Why do I live, why do I die, tell me where do I go, tell me why.” The show is playful and chaotic, but there’s also a sense of outrage in its protests against war, racism, sexism, pollution and the general hypocrisy of an era dominated by the American involvement in Vietnam. “I’d still like ‘Hair’ to be about what it was about then,” Rado told The Associated Press in 1993. “‘Hair’ had a spiritual message, and it has a mystical message I hope is coming through — there’s more to life than the way it’s been devised for us, explained to us, taught to us.” The songs of “Hair” have been used in everything from the films “Forrest Gump,” “Minions” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to TV shows like “Glee,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and “My Name Is Earl.” Billboard magazine lists “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” at No. 66 of all-time top 100 songs. In 2019, the original 1968 Broadway cast recording was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden deemed “these aural treasures worthy of preservation because of their cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.” Rado was born in Venice, California, and raised in Rochester, New York, and Washington, D.C. After serving two years in the U.S. Navy, he moved to New York and studied acting with Paula and Lee Strasberg. Rado was part of the ensemble of the Broadway play “Marathon ’33” in 1963 and played Richard Lionheart in “The Lion in Winter” in 1966 opposite Christopher Walken. He met Ragni when he was cast in the off-Broadway musical “Hang Down Your Head and Die.” The two were interested in birthing a new kind of show and focused on the hippie scene. They wrote the script while sharing an apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. Rado originated the “Hair” role of the draftee Claude on Broadway. “Hair” met resistance across the country. In addition to the use of four-letter words, the flouting of authority, sexual references and gross-out humor, the end of Act 1 had the entire cast strip naked to “Where Do I Go” and there was what many believed was desecration of the American flag. There were church pickets in Evansville, Indiana. Municipal officials in Chattanooga, Tennessee, denied a request to stage the show, determining that it would not be “in the best interest of the community.” In Denver, police threatened to arrest anyone who appeared nude onstage. A Boston visit was challenged in court on the basis of flag desecration. The original Public Theater production had cut the nude scene, but the creators wanted it back for the Broadway debut. Under the law at that time, New York City allowed nudity onstage onstage as long as the actors weren’t moving, which is why the whole cast of “Hair” stood together in a row, nude and perfectly still. After “Hair,” Rado wrote the music and lyrics of the off-Broadway show “Rainbow,” co-authoring the book with his brother, Ted Rado. He later teamed up with Ragni to create the book and lyrics for the show “Sun.” Ragni died in 1991. Rado wrote a new show called “American Soldier” with his brother. In 2009, Rado, MacDermot and Ragni were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., of the group The Fifth Dimension, were joined onstage by the Broadway cast at the time for a finale that brought the ceremony’s approximately 1,000 guests to their feet. MacDermot died in 2018. Rado told the Hudson Reporter in 2009 that none of the show’s creators anticipated that it would have such an enormous impact. “We thought we’d stumbled on a great idea, and something that potentially could be a hit on Broadway, never thinking of the distant future.” He is survived by his brother Ted Rado, sister-in-law Kay Rado, nieces Melanie Khoury, Emily DiBona and Melissa Stuart, great-nieces and a great-nephew. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"
7,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,politics," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
8,Uvalde Officer Was Detained Trying To Save His Wife Who Was Dying In A Classroom,politics,"  A Uvalde school police officer was prohibited from trying to save his wife, a Robb Elementary school teacher, during the deadly mass shooting in May. His wife, fourth grade teacher Eva Mireles, was one of the two teachers killed in the attack. Nineteen children also lost their lives. Texas Department of Public Safety director Col. Steven McCraw revealed the details while giving testimony on Tuesday. He also called the police response to the massacre an “abject failure.” The officer, Ruben Ruiz, arrived at the school after the accused 18-year-old gunman walked into Robb Elementary, KSAT reported. Mireles had called Ruiz and told him that she had been shot and was “dying.” “And what happened to [Ruiz] is he tried to move forward into the hallway,” McCraw said. “He was detained and they took his gun away from him and escorted him off the scene.” McCraw also criticized school district police chief Pete Arredondo for his handling of the mass shooting. At least three investigations are currently studying the response by law enforcement. “Obviously, not enough training was done in this situation, plain and simple,” McCraw said of the police chief. “Because terrible decisions were made by the on-site commander.” "
9,Broadway Drops Theater Mask Mandate As Stars Fall Sick With COVID,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Broadway theaters in New York will drop coronavirus mask mandates for audience members starting July 1, the industry trade group Broadway League announced Tuesday. “The owners and operators of all 41 Broadway theatres in New York City will keep masking mandates in place at all Broadway theatres through June 30, and will adopt a ‘mask optional’ policy for the month of July,” the announcement stated. “Audience members are still encouraged to wear masks in theaters.” The Broadway League said it will reconsider masking protocols on a monthly basis and will announce the policy for August in mid-July. “This is not an easy decision — there are more people that want masks off than on, but plenty still want them on — and we’re encouraging people that have any concerns to wear their masks,” said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, according to The New York Times. The requirement is being loosened after several Broadway stars tested positive for COVID this month. Beanie Feldstein, the protagonist of “Funny Girl” on Broadway, announced she contracted COVID in an Instagram post on June 7. Feldstein was replaced by Julie Benko during her recovery, according to a tweet posted on the show’s account. Hugh Jackman, the star of “The Music Man,” announced he tested positive for the virus on June 13, less than a day after performing at the Tony Awards. Jackman said Max Clayton would fill in for him. The relaxed mask mandate at Broadway theatres was announced on the same day that New York City downgraded its COVID-19 alert level from high to medium, citing a decrease in cases and hospitalizations. COVID-19 cases per 100,000 in the city were now at 240.4 and hospitalizations per 100,000 had fallen to 9.8, Mayor Eric Adams and Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said in a joint statement. “We’re grateful to New Yorkers for their continued attention and vigilance as we’ve made our way through to the other side of this wave,” the two officials said. The medium COVID alert level includes recommendations for people to get vaccinated and boosted, and to wear a mask in public indoor spaces where the vaccination status of other people is unknown. Under the previous high alert level, New Yorkers were told to wear a mask indoors regardless of vaccination status. Adams and Vasan said health officials learned a lot about the virus during this year’s surge and highlighted the importance of existing public health safety measures, including masks. “Testing, vaccinations, treatments, and masking have been vital tools to keep people alive and out of the hospital,” they said. “But we know there remains no greater defense against this virus than vaccination, which is why we’re pleased that young children are now eligible for the protection they deserve, and can’t wait to begin under-5 vaccination.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended COVID vaccinations for children under age 5 on Saturday. The first vaccinations for this age group in New York City are set to begin Wednesday. Earlier, this month New York’s mayor rolled back mask requirements for children under the age of 5 “in all early childhood settings.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Bloodshed In Buffalo And Uvalde Has Sparked A Wave Of State Gun Control Bills,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost After years of inaction, Congress is on the brink of passing legislation that would toughen gun laws. A proposal that has already cleared an early procedural vote follows two horrific mass shootings that rocked the country in May. In Buffalo, a white supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket. In Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were massacred by a lone gunman who was eventually killed by police. The potential legislation is modest, compared to reformers’ wish list — there is nothing that would make background checks universal, nor any restriction on the assault weapons used in both recent mass shootings. But states are another story: In the weeks since Buffalo and Uvalde, a raft of states has passed, or is seriously considering, much stronger measures. They include tight restrictions on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, as well as age limit increases for buying weapons. (Both shooters in those cases were 18 years old.) This presents a dilemma for reformers. It’s easy to skirt the resulting uneven patchwork of laws. The New York subway shooter, for example, would have had to fill out a lengthy application for a handgun in New York City, where he could only legally buy a magazine capable of holding 10 rounds. Instead, he bought the Glock 17 he used for the shooting in Ohio. “The question of federal action can’t be understated,” Noah Lumbantobing, press secretary for March For Our Lives, said. “We need a floor in this country for what gun safety looks like ... That said, state action is where it happens.” The proposal in Congress, made public on Tuesday, aims to close the “boyfriend loophole” and incentivize states to implement red flag laws. Federal law bars people with certain domestic violence convictions from owning guns, but the so-called “boyfriend loophole” lets cases fall through the cracks when they involve less formal relationships. Red flag laws allow a judge to temporarily stop a person from owning firearms if evidence shows they present a danger. The bill would also pour more than a quarter-billion dollars into less contentious programs with track records of success, like community violence intervention, mental health services and suicide prevention. Congress inching towards gun reform, however, pales in comparison to the aggressive action taken by several liberal strongholds in response to the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde over the last few weeks. New York passed a package of laws that raised the age for buying semi-automatic rifles to 21, banned body armor for most people outside law enforcement and tightened its red flag law. New York’s red flag law, passed in 2019, came under scrutiny after it failed to stop the Buffalo shooter. At age 17, he talked about wanting to commit a murder-suicide, prompting a police referral and psychiatric evaluation — neither of which prevented him from buying the gun he used the next year. Delaware is poised to ban the sale of assault-style semi-automatic rifles and limit magazines to 17 rounds. Washington state implemented a law, passed in March, that capped magazines at 10 rounds. Magazine restrictions, which aim to make it harder for mass shooters to kill so many people at once, have become a top legal demand from reformers. Several other gun control measures are winding their way through state legislatures in California and New Jersey. Other state laws remain in the works. The California state Assembly, which already passed a state-level version of the lapsed assault weapons ban, is considering whether to require gun owners to take out liability insurance. And New Jersey lawmakers are combing through a pile of bills filed with little interest earlier this year, to see which ones might ride the wave of post-Buffalo and Uvalde fury to get passed into law. Raising the age to buy a rifle, banning weapons greater than .50 caliber that shoot cartridges longer than 5.54 inches, and making it easier to sue gunmakers are all possibilities. For the last two decades, Democratic-led states have tried to limit access to firearms and resurrect elements of the federal assault weapons ban that lapsed in 2004, often pushing hardest in the wake of mass shootings. Republican-led states, on the other hand, have largely moved in the opposite direction, making it easier to carry handguns in more places. With Republicans controlling most statehouses and governorships, state inertia looks likely to continue. But if there’s a state to watch to judge whether a wider Republican shift on gun reform is in the works, it’s Texas. Few states have done more to promote gun freedoms than Texas. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a law in 2015 letting concealed license-holders carry firearms on university campuses. Texas eliminated the requirement to obtain a concealed handgun license in 2021, joining the ranks of “permitless carry” states. Texas also leads the country when it comes to mass shootings. And even before Uvalde, it also led the nation in child gun deaths, with the annual number of children dying by gunshot doubling over Abbott’s tenure. Abbott has largely resisted the Democratic minority’s push for reforms in response to mass shootings in the past. His refusal to call a special session of the legislature to contemplate gun reform after Uvalde and dismissal of appeals to raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles indicate he’s still cold on reform. But the spectacle of so many young children dying in Uvalde has ratcheted up pressure to take action. Whether or not that will translate into law when the every-other-year state legislature meets again in January largely depends on the outcome of the governor’s race. Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) has waged a long-shot effort to unseat Abbott in a state where Democrats haven’t won a statewide election since 1994. A former mayor and representative of El Paso, O’Rourke made gun control his most urgent issue in his Democratic presidential primary bid after the 2019 Walmart shooting. Uvalde has put the issue back at the top of his agenda. The election will likely act as a referendum on the state’s gun policies. If Abbott trounces O’Rourke, the legislature will have little incentive to reconsider an approach that appears to work for the Republican Party at the ballot box. A strong Democratic showing, however, might nudge Texas Republicans to change their approach, according to Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. “If Beto is able to keep Abbott’s margin of victory in the low single digits, we can link that to gun control,” Jones said. “But if, on the other hand, Abbott defeats Beto in the 10 to 15% range, the pressure for any reform on gun control will be slim to none.” But short of an O’Rourke victory, Derek Cohen, a senior fellow at Texas-based criminal justice reform group Right on Crime, didn’t expect the state legislature to change its strategy. Instead, the pressure from Uvalde would likely spur a flurry of bills as the 2023 session opened, with few of them going anywhere. “We’re going to see every single policy proposal that exists under the sun,” Cohen said. “But states are generally at where they’re at because of where they’re at.” “It all sounds so defeatist,” Cohen added. “But it just underscores the complexity of the problem.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

12,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said.

13,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

16,Minnesota Police Dept. Will Pay $3.2M Settlement To Daunte Wright's Family,politics," BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. (AP) — A suburban Minneapolis city has agreed to pay $3.2 million to the family of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer who said she confused her gun for her Taser. The tentative settlement also includes changes in police policies and training involving traffic stops like the one that resulted in Wright’s death, according to a statement Tuesday night from attorneys representing Wright’s family. Wright was shot once in the chest by Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter, who is white, after the 20-year-old was stopped for expired registration tags in April 2021. The former officer was subsequently convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to two years in prison. Potter is heard on video yelling “Taser” several times just before she fires her pistol. Wright’s family members “hope and believe the measures of change to policing, policies and training will create important improvements to the community in Daunte’s name,” said co-counsel Antonio M. Romanucci. “Nothing can bring him back, but the family hopes his legacy is a positive one and prevents any other family from enduring the type of grief they will live with for the rest of their lives.” The Associated Press left a message Wednesday seeking comment from the mayor’s office. The shooting happened at a time of high tension in the area, with former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, standing trial just miles away for the killing of George Floyd, who was Black. Floyd’s May 2020 death prompted a reckoning over police brutality and discrimination involving people of color. The fallout from Wright’s death led the Brooklyn Center City Council to pass a series of reforms, including the use of social workers and other trained professionals to respond to medical, mental health and social-needs calls that don’t require police. The changes also prohibit police from making arrests for low-level offenses and require the city to use unarmed civilians to handle minor traffic violations. The settlement is one of the largest involving police conduct Minnesota. Last year, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd’s family. Minneapolis previously paid $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, after she called 911 to report a suspected assault behind her home in July 2017 and was fatally shot by Mohamed Noor, one of the officers who responded to her call. Noor is Somali American and Damond was white. ___ Find the AP’s full coverage of the Daunte Wright case: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-daunte-wright Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,"Senate Gun Bill Closes 'Boyfriend Loophole,' Gives Abusers Chance 'To Straighten Up'",politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — The bipartisan gun safety legislation unveiled in the Senate this week would close the notorious “boyfriend loophole” — with a catch. Dating partners convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors would lose their gun rights under the proposal, but only for five years if they avoid committing another violent offense. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the lead Republican negotiator, said the opportunity for someone to get their guns back is an incentive “for people who have made a mistake and have committed domestic violence and received a misdemeanor conviction to straighten up their act and to not repeat it.” Seventy women are shot by intimate partners every month, on average, according to an analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data by the gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety. Federal law already prohibits gun ownership by people convicted of domestic violence against a spouse or someone with whom they share a child or an address. Dating partners living separately have been exempted from the ban — that’s why gun control advocates call it the boyfriend loophole. Recent bipartisan gun legislation passed by the House of Representatives would close the loophole with no opportunity for the abuser to get their gun rights back, as is currently the case for convicted spouses or parents. The ban also applies to people subject to restraining orders. Last week the senators working on the deal said the boyfriend loophole was one of their final major obstacles. Adopting a temporary gun ownership ban instead of a permanent one apparently helped close the deal. “We are closing the boyfriend loophole,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the lead Democratic negotiator, said Tuesday. “In states that have taken this step already, there are 10% fewer intimate partner deaths.” Murphy told HuffPost on Wednesday that creating a path for dating partners to get their gun rights back was just the “nature of the compromise” Democrats have to make in order to change policy. Negotiators also settled on a narrower definition of “dating partner” than the House adopted. The new definition considers the “length” and “nature” of the relationship and “the frequency and type of interaction between the individuals involved,” whereas the House bill specified it didn’t matter if there had been any sexual contact in the relationship. The Senate text resembles language used to define dating partners in a number of state domestic violence laws. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told HuffPost “there were a lot of complexities” but declined to get into the details of how negotiators came to an agreement on dating partners before the Senate actually passes the bill. “It’s like asking a surgeon to talk about the operation in the middle of the procedure,” Blumenthal said. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, called the bill “an important and lifesaving step forward,” adding that her organization will “continue to work with domestic violence organizations to protect even more women from armed abusers.” The broader bill, which would require greater scrutiny of teenage gun buyers and provide funding for mental health services, school security and “state crisis intervention orders,” cleared a procedural vote on Tuesday and could pass the Senate as soon as later this week. Fourteen Republicans voted for it, making its support thoroughly bipartisan. Democrats who had pushed to close the boyfriend loophole praised the bill. “I am especially pleased it includes provisions from a bill I have led for years to close the boyfriend loophole, which will keep guns out of the hands of abusive dating partners convicted of domestic violence,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said. In the past, the National Rifle Association and Republicans have opposed closing the boyfriend loophole. Last year, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) questioned whether “a misdemeanor [should] stand as the line crossed for an individual to lose a constitutional right.” Cornyn called the bill “a step in the right direction” nearly a month after an 18-year-old legally purchased an assault rifle to slaughter 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Democrats had sought restrictions on rifle sales to people under 21, but the negotiators settled on the enhanced background checks instead. Cornyn suggested that and the mental health provisions could prevent future teenage gunmen like the Uvalde killer. The Texas Republican also stressed that the bill doesn’t infringe gun rights for anyone not convicted of a crime, describing the boyfriend loophole provision as protection for domestic violence victims. “It shouldn’t matter whether a person is married to their abuser, if the abuser is convicted of domestic violence, and many people have what I would call nontraditional relationships, whether they are living together, they have a child together, or whether they just have a long-term romantic or intimate relationship,” Cornyn said. The National Rifle Association has come out against the bill, though the organization did not specify which provisions drew its ire, saying instead that the legislation opens the door to “unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners.” The legislation’s various background check and domestic violence provisions are likely popular with voters ― as Cornyn noted Tuesday, pointing to recent polling. “Eighty-six percent of gun-owning households support that sort of protection for domestic violence victims, where, too often, a gun is involved,” Cornyn said. “Again, this doesn’t limit law-abiding gun owners’ rights unless somebody is convicted of domestic abuse under their state laws. Their gun rights will not be impacted.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

9,"James Rado, Co-Creator Of Groundbreaking Musical ‘Hair,’ Dead At 90",politics," NEW YORK (AP) — James Rado, co-creator of the groundbreaking hippie musical “Hair,” which celebrated protest, pot and free love and paved the way for the sound of rock on Broadway, has died. He was 90. Rado died Tuesday night in New York City of cardio respiratory arrest, according to friend and publicist Merle Frimark. “Hair,” which has a story and lyrics by Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot, was the first rock musical on Broadway, the first Broadway show to feature full nudity and the first to feature a same-sex kiss. “Hair” made possible other rock musicals like “Jesus Christ Superstar” and “Rent.” Like “Hamilton,” it was one of only a handful of Broadway shows in the past few decades to find its songs on the pop charts. The so-called “American tribal love-rock musical,” had its world premiere at the Public Theater in New York City’s East Village in 1967 and transferred the following year to Broadway, where the musical ran more than 1,800 performances. Rado played Claude, a young man about to be drafted and sent to the war in Vietnam. Clive Barnes, theater critic for The New York Times, called the show “the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.” The New York Post said it had “unintentional charm,” contagious high spirits and a “young zestfulness” that “make it difficult to resist.” Variety, however, called it “loony.” It lost the Tony in 1969 to the more traditional “1776” but won a Grammy Award. The 2009 revival won the best revival Tony. The show was revived on Broadway in 1977 and again in 2009. It was made into a movie directed by Milos Forman in 1979 starring Treat Williams and Beverly D’Angelo. “Hair” spawned four top four singles on the American pop charts, including the No. 1 hit “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” by the Fifth Dimension, which won the Grammy Award for record of the year and best pop vocal performance by a group in 1970. Others included “Hair” by the Cowsills, “Good Morning, Starshine” by the singer Oliver and “Easy to Be Hard” by Three Dog Night. The cast album itself stayed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks “Hair” tells the story of Claude and Berger, best buddies who find freedom in the late 1960s. Between draft-card burnings, love-ins, bad LSD trips and a parade of protest marches, the two wander through a New York filled with flower children, drugged-out hippies and outraged tourists who don’t approve of the wild goings-on. In one song, Claude poignantly sings, “Why do I live, why do I die, tell me where do I go, tell me why.” The show is playful and chaotic, but there’s also a sense of outrage in its protests against war, racism, sexism, pollution and the general hypocrisy of an era dominated by the American involvement in Vietnam. “I’d still like ‘Hair’ to be about what it was about then,” Rado told The Associated Press in 1993. “‘Hair’ had a spiritual message, and it has a mystical message I hope is coming through — there’s more to life than the way it’s been devised for us, explained to us, taught to us.” The songs of “Hair” have been used in everything from the films “Forrest Gump,” “Minions” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to TV shows like “Glee,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and “My Name Is Earl.” Billboard magazine lists “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” at No. 66 of all-time top 100 songs. In 2019, the original 1968 Broadway cast recording was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden deemed “these aural treasures worthy of preservation because of their cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.” Rado was born in Venice, California, and raised in Rochester, New York, and Washington, D.C. After serving two years in the U.S. Navy, he moved to New York and studied acting with Paula and Lee Strasberg. Rado was part of the ensemble of the Broadway play “Marathon ’33” in 1963 and played Richard Lionheart in “The Lion in Winter” in 1966 opposite Christopher Walken. He met Ragni when he was cast in the off-Broadway musical “Hang Down Your Head and Die.” The two were interested in birthing a new kind of show and focused on the hippie scene. They wrote the script while sharing an apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. Rado originated the “Hair” role of the draftee Claude on Broadway. “Hair” met resistance across the country. In addition to the use of four-letter words, the flouting of authority, sexual references and gross-out humor, the end of Act 1 had the entire cast strip naked to “Where Do I Go” and there was what many believed was desecration of the American flag. There were church pickets in Evansville, Indiana. Municipal officials in Chattanooga, Tennessee, denied a request to stage the show, determining that it would not be “in the best interest of the community.” In Denver, police threatened to arrest anyone who appeared nude onstage. A Boston visit was challenged in court on the basis of flag desecration. The original Public Theater production had cut the nude scene, but the creators wanted it back for the Broadway debut. Under the law at that time, New York City allowed nudity onstage onstage as long as the actors weren’t moving, which is why the whole cast of “Hair” stood together in a row, nude and perfectly still. After “Hair,” Rado wrote the music and lyrics of the off-Broadway show “Rainbow,” co-authoring the book with his brother, Ted Rado. He later teamed up with Ragni to create the book and lyrics for the show “Sun.” Ragni died in 1991. Rado wrote a new show called “American Soldier” with his brother. In 2009, Rado, MacDermot and Ragni were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., of the group The Fifth Dimension, were joined onstage by the Broadway cast at the time for a finale that brought the ceremony’s approximately 1,000 guests to their feet. MacDermot died in 2018. Rado told the Hudson Reporter in 2009 that none of the show’s creators anticipated that it would have such an enormous impact. “We thought we’d stumbled on a great idea, and something that potentially could be a hit on Broadway, never thinking of the distant future.” He is survived by his brother Ted Rado, sister-in-law Kay Rado, nieces Melanie Khoury, Emily DiBona and Melissa Stuart, great-nieces and a great-nephew. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"
10,Q&A With Carlina Rivera: NY-10 Democratic Congressional Candidate Is Keeping It Local,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost NEW YORK ― State courts may have snuffed out New York Democrats’ gerrymandering dreams, but for some of the party’s up-and-comers, the final, nonpartisan district lines still hold promise. Nowhere is that truer than in the Empire State’s entirely new 10th Congressional District, which comprises lower Manhattan and a cluster of contiguous neighborhoods in central and South Brooklyn. A number of hopefuls pounced at the rare chance to run in an open, overwhelmingly Democratic seat. Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, and U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones are just three of the candidates who have already declared their intention to run in the Aug. 23 primary. Rivera recently picked up the endorsement of one of Jones’ colleagues in the House, Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.). HuffPost is running an interview series with the 10th District candidates, and our first sit-down was with New York City Council Member Carlina Rivera in Hamilton Fish Park. The Lower East Side location, just across the street from the Section 8 housing where she grew up, exemplifies Rivera’s deeply local reasons for running. Rivera played small forward on the park’s basketball courts as a youngster and now uses her perch on the City Council to fund a youth basketball tournament there. Unlike other candidates with clear national constituencies and ideological lanes, Rivera, the daughter of a single Puerto Rican mother who migrated to the mainland, eschews labels and pet policy issues. She and her husband, Jamie, live just north of New York 10th’s boundaries, but she is running as a native daughter of the Lower East Side’s working-class Latino precincts eager to continue fighting for her neighbors. Rivera is proud of her work establishing New York City’s first public fund for out-of-state residents seeking abortions, helping small businesses survive at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, overseeing the city’s public hospital system, and supporting violence prevention programs. She is also a sneakerhead who practices hot yoga and enjoys touring the middle of the country with her husband, whom she met while serving on Manhattan Community Board 3. For the couple’s next road trip, they’re flying to Cleveland and then driving from there to Detroit. HuffPost spoke with Rivera about how she got into politics, why she’s running, and where she falls on the ideological spectrum. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Tell me a little bit about how you got involved in politics. Being a part of local programs — going to the library, playing ball. I got involved because we would always be talking about what’s going on in the neighborhood, what’s important. My family and the families that I grew up with wanted to know what was free, what was affordable. So we would always be sharing information. And that’s when we would learn when things were changing or some of our favorite small businesses were closing. The campaign that I was really a part of that got me interested in local politics was the Essex Crossing construction project on Delancey Street. We wanted to make sure that affordable housing and those Essex Street market vendors were a core part of the redevelopment plan that was going on. We decided as a community what was absolutely essential when it came to this project. We wanted it to be community-led development with our voices at the table. We said it has to have affordable housing. We wanted an open space. We wanted to make sure there was local hiring for the jobs and that there was a seamless relocation of the Essex Street Market vendors. In the end, I thought there was a good balance there. How do you see yourself replicating that kind of work in Congress, which is obviously a different body than the City Council? What I’m excited about and what I think an effective member of Congress does well is that they’re able to look at the local issues and things that are happening in their community. They have their ear to the ground and they can tie it into a national dialogue and bring those national resources for local problems. So whether it’s supporting open spaces in the face of climate change, and looking to build a greener infrastructure, whether it’s transit dollars, health care dollars — all of this I think is very, very related. Looking at issues intersectionally and with an equity lens has been something that I’ve done on the council. When we discuss the issues that are affecting people in NY-10, those are universal issues that are felt across the country: housing insecurity, health care, public safety, climate change — things that we have to act on. “We can't arrest our way out of the crime spike.” Your mother is a unionized civilian employee for the New York Police Department. What are your conversations with her about policing like? We can agree that if the presence of police and a big policing budget were enough to stop crime, there would be very, very different circumstances in this city [which has a large police force]. But policing alone is not enough. That’s why the strategies have to be based on community investment. There has to be community-led programming and services. We can’t arrest our way out of the crime spike. It just hasn’t worked and many of the people who are incarcerated really need services that focus on their health care and that are really trauma-informed. Murders have gone down nearly 9% from this time in 2021. Obviously, that’s still way higher than it was in 2019. But can you attribute some of the progress to the greater presence of police in the subways or other things that Mayor Eric Adams has tried? It really has to do with our gun control issues. The least that we can do for the families of people who have been killed in our supermarkets and in our churches and in our schools is to pass commonsense gun-control legislation. This hits close to home. Even with New York having some of the strongest gun control laws in the country, there is still a real ability to bring those guns from other places and affect the families here as well. It takes police to enforce gun control laws though, right? There’s a role for law enforcement. Absolutely. But there have to be complementary strategies that are community-led that include violence interrupters, and treat gun violence as a public health issue. And we have some great programs right here in New York City. We have Avenues for Justice, which is a program that’s a national model for alternatives to incarceration. We also have the Stand Up to Violence program in Jacobi Hospital where there is intervention right there with the gun violence victims and with credible messengers, people from the community who are asking, “How did they get here in the first place?” So there are things that are working. Those are some of the tools that we have to use, in addition to an effective police presence. What do you think of the job Mayor Adams is doing overall? What I like about him is that he’s a cheerleader for the city — no question about that. Some of the issues like the spike in crime are difficult to navigate and we have a lot more to do on that. You ran for City Council speaker last year and lost. Why were you unsuccessful? I’m a very independent person. And I think I’ve shown that in my decisions that I’ve made and how I operate:first and foremost, taking care of my community. For council speaker, I think I built a really great coalition of people that knew that I would be a great leader — someone who was a listener, who was very pragmatic and compassionate. My independence maybe just led me down a different path. How do you see yourself ideologically? Would you be a member of the Progressive Caucus? Would you be a member of “the Squad”? My record speaks for itself. As the Supreme Court’s preparing to gut Roe v. Wade, I was preparing New York for a post-Roe world establishing the nation’s first abortion access fund, looking at how to lead on issues related to climate, transit and public safety. That sort of progress is important for all cities and municipalities. I remain eternally, cautiously optimistic on what the makeup of Washington will be like. But we also have to support our local towns and cities. There are a lot of similar interests among some of the candidates. However, my experience and what I’ve been able to do on the council, what I plan to do in Washington, the local support that I have — NY-10 voters want that local perspective in Washington. I’m a homegrown candidate, and I think all of that is unparalleled. What is your relationship with progressive groups like the Working Families Party? Would you seek their endorsement? I have a great relationship with the Working Families Party and I’ll certainly be talking to them about supporting my race. We have similar ideals and values and we have campaigned for a lot of the same candidates. Do you have any thoughts on Rep. Mondaire Jones moving to the city to run? I don’t care if you’ve been here two weeks or forever. New York City is the welcoming city. That’s our whole history — welcoming different people in, welcoming waves of immigrants. Including members of Congress from the suburbs? Yeah! “Housing has to be a priority. I believe it’s a human right.” Do you think there’s too much local resistance to new real estate development, especially when it comes to units for low-income and vulnerable people? We need a real focus on building affordable housing. The creation of affordable housing is finally at the forefront of the national agenda. President Biden mentioned that, the mayor mentioned that — it has to be our priority for low-income people and middle-income people; for seniors and members of the LGBTQ community; for at-risk youth, and those who are overcoming addiction. There are populations that are not being directly served. And overall, we just do not have enough affordable housing. Housing has to be a priority. I believe it’s a human right. How would you advocate for Puerto Rico in Congress? I have so many memories there, and very recently, of what my family is going through there — every time we can’t reach them, because the power is out, or a disaster has devastated the infrastructure. The people of Puerto Rico should have the resources and the support for self-determination to figure out what they want to do. So I know there’s legislation like that in Washington right now that is supported by multiple Puertorriqueños that would allow them to vote on their status, be it for independence, statehood, or another alternative. The self-determination piece is so, so important. Taxation without representation is wrong. Puerto Rico does need to write its own story. What do you think of running against former Mayor Bill de Blasio? The question that comes to mind is: Why is each candidate running? I’m running on a great record, as a homegrown candidate. And whenever I leave my role as a council member I’m going to be proud of my legacy. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

12,Biden To Call For National Gas Tax Holiday Through End Of September,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday will call on Congress to suspend federal gasoline and diesel taxes for three months — a move meant to ease financial pressures at the pump that also reveals the political toxicity of high gas prices in an election year. The Democratic president will also call on states to suspend their own gas taxes or provide similar relief, according to administration officials who previewed his proposals on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. At issue is the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal tax on gas and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon federal tax on diesel fuel. If the gas savings were fully passed along to consumers, people would save roughly 3.6% at the pump when prices are averaging about $5 a gallon nationwide. But many economists and lawmakers from both parties view the idea of a gas tax holiday with skepticism. Barack Obama, during the 2008 presidential campaign, called the idea a “gimmick” that allowed politicians to “say that they did something.” He also warned that oil companies could offset the tax relief by increasing their prices. High gas prices pose a fundamental threat to Biden’s electoral and policy ambitions. They’ve caused confidence in the economy to slump to lows that bode poorly for defending Democratic control of the House and the Senate in November. Biden’s past efforts to cut gas prices — including the release of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and greater ethanol blending this summer — have done little to produce savings at the pump, a risk that carries over to the idea of a gas tax holiday. Biden has acknowledged how gas prices have been a drain on public enthusiasm when he is trying to convince people that the U.S. can still pivot to a clean-energy future. In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Biden described a country already nursing some psychological scars from the coronavirus pandemic that is now worried about how to afford gas, food and other essentials. “If you notice, until gas prices started going up,” Biden said, “things were much more, they were much more optimistic.” The president can do remarkably little to fix prices that are set by global markets, profit-driven companies, consumer demand and aftershocks from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the embargoes that followed. The underlying problem is a shortage of oil and refineries that produce gas, a challenge a tax holiday cannot necessarily fix. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, estimated that the majority of the 8.6% inflation seen over the past 12 months in the U.S. comes from higher commodity prices due to Russia’s invasion and continued disruptions from the coronavirus. “In the immediate near term, it is critical to stem the increase in oil prices,” Zandi said last week, suggesting that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and a nuclear deal with Iran could help to boost supplies and lower prices. Republican lawmakers have tried to shift more blame to Biden, saying he created a hostile environment for domestic oil producers, causing their output to stay below pre-pandemic levels. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell mocked the idea of a gas tax holiday in a February floor speech. “They’ve spent an entire year waging a holy war on affordable American energy, and now they want to use a pile of taxpayers’ money to hide the consequences,” he said. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has previously expressed doubts about the value of suspending the federal gas tax. Administration officials said the $10 billion cost of the gas tax holiday would be paid for and the Highway Trust Fund kept whole, even though the gas taxes make up a substantial source of revenue for the fund. The officials did not specify any new revenue sources. The president has also called on energy companies to accept lower profit margins to increase oil production and refining capacity for gasoline. This has increased tensions with oil producers: Biden has judged the companies to be making “more money than God.” That kicked off a chain of events in which the head of Chevron, Michael Wirth, sent a letter to the White House saying that the administration “has largely sought to criticize, and at times vilify, our industry.” Asked about the letter, Biden said of Wirth: “He’s mildly sensitive. I didn’t know they’d get their feelings hurt that quickly.” Energy companies are scheduled to meet Thursday with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to discuss ways to increase supply.

14,NRA Won’t Support Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill: ‘Falls Short At Every Level’,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The National Rifle Association said it would oppose Congress’s bipartisan effort to tighten the nation’s gun laws after a spate of deadly mass shootings, saying the legislation would place an undue burden on “law-abiding gun owners.” “We will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level,” the group said in a statement Tuesday. “It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners.” The Senate advanced a bipartisan gun safety bill on Tuesday in hopes of curbing America’s epidemic of gun violence. Lawmakers have been working to bridge a political impasse after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last month that left 19 children and two adults dead. Senators now expect the bill to pass later this week, and though the legislation doesn’t go as far as some Democrats wanted, it represents fierce negotiation amid the public outcry over a recent barrage of mass shootings. Fourteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms. The bill would also fund aid for mental health and schools, and it would enhance background checks for gun buyers younger than 21. States would also be given incentives to adopt “red flag” laws to try to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed a danger to themselves or others. Importantly, the proposal would also close the “boyfriend loophole,” adding unmarried intimate partners to the list of those convicted of domestic violence who are prohibited from getting a firearm. Those efforts, however, go too far, the NRA said. 🚨BREAKING: NRA Announces Opposition to Senate Gun Control Legislation""This legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, & use fed dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state & local politicians."" pic.twitter.com/tXriTiWLzw “This legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, and use federal dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state and local politicians,” it said Tuesday. “This bill leaves too much discretion in the hands of government officials and also contains undefined and overbroad provisions ― inviting interference with our constitutional freedoms.” Recent polls show a majority of Americans support common-sense gun reform, and though Tuesday’s bill doesn’t include broader restrictions such as a ban on assault weapons, Democrats championed it as an effort to help save American lives. “This bill doesn’t include everything I want, but it will save countless lives and finally break a 30-year political logjam,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Tuesday. “I look forward to earning bipartisan support for this historic legislation among my Senate colleagues this week.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Establishment Republican Katie Britt Wins Alabama GOP Senate Primary,politics," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Establishment-backed Republican Katie Britt won the GOP nomination for Alabama’s open Senate seat Tuesday night, triumphing in a race where former President Donald Trump reversed his initial support for her opponent and ultimately endorsed her. The victory in deep-red Alabama virtually ensures that Britt will replace her former boss, longtime Sen. Richard Shelby, in Congress’ upper chamber. Britt defeated Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) in a runoff election, winning with 65.5% of the vote to 34.5% for Brooks when The Associated Press called the race for Britt at about 9:30 p.m. Eastern Britt won with the backing of former President Donald Trump ― but she does not owe her victory to him. Britt, who previously served as chief of staff for Shelby and led Alabama’s state-level chamber of commerce, was the Republican establishment’s choice in the contest, and had the tacit backing of groups controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Brooks, a longtime Trump ally, fully endorsed the president’s false claims of a stolen 2020 election, while Britt avoided doing the same. Trump, accordingly, endorsed Brooks not long after Shelby announced his retirement. However, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC controlled by McConnell allies, raised $4 million with Shelby to fund a group attacking Brooks. The group aired television ads that highlighted Brooks’ criticisms of Trump’s conservatism and character from before his presidency. Those ads worked to drive down Brooks’ poll numbers. Seeing a sinking political ship, Trump used Brooks’ suggestion that voters move forward from his stolen election claims as an excuse to ditch the congressman. He un-endorsed Brooks in March. “Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you,’ despite the fact that the Election was rife with fraud and irregularities,” Trump said in a statement at the time, employing a very strange definition of “woke.” In the May primary, Britt won easily with 45% of the vote, but failed to break the 50% margin necessary to avoid a runoff. Brooks finished second with 29% of the vote. On June 10, long after it became clear that Britt would almost certainly win the runoff, Trump endorsed her. Britt is now set to face Democrat Will Boyd in November. She’s an overwhelming favorite in the heavily Republican state.

16,"Louisiana Governor Cracks Down On Abortion Pills, Strengthens Trigger Ban",politics," Reporter, HuffPost Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a rare anti-abortion Democrat, signed two pieces of legislation in the past week taking aim at abortion ahead of the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe v. Wade. One of the new measures bans physicians from prescribing medication abortion over the phone or online, requiring patients to go to a provider in person and take the medication in front of them. The new policy, slated to go into effect on Aug. 1, will be complicated and time-consuming for patients seeking this common first-trimester option. The abortion-inducing pills must be taken over the course of 24-48 hours, so the law would require patients to take multiple visits to a provider. And abortion clinics nationwide have been inundated with out-of-state patients, partly due to Texas and Oklahoma ― both near Louisiana ― enacting the country’s strictest abortion bans in recent months. In many places, experts on the matter say, clinic appointments are booked two to four weeks out. Another bill Edwards signed strengthens Louisiana’s so-called “trigger ban” that allows the state to swiftly outlaw abortion if the Supreme Court overthrows Roe v. Wade, which may happen in the coming weeks. This legislation increases the criminal penalties for abortion, increasing prison time from five to ten years and raising fines from $10,000 to $100,000. Edwards said in a statement that he signed the update to the trigger ban even though he believes it should include exceptions for rape and incest, which it does not. “My position on abortion has been unwavering,” he said. “I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact. This does not belie my belief that there should be an exception to the prohibition on abortion for victims of rape and incest.” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement Tuesday that Louisiana Republicans “should be ashamed of themselves” and that her office will be working to ensure voters oust Edwards from office next year in light of his stance on reproductive rights. “Instead of working overtime to ensure the people of Louisiana can continue to make their own decisions about when to start or grow their families, these politicians are finding new ways to insert themselves into our personal lives. Voters won’t forget which politicians refused to protect their rights in this critical moment — and NARAL will be working to educate and mobilize them to ensure a champion for reproductive freedom wins the governor’s office in 2023,” she said. Louisiana is one of 13 states with trigger laws on the books, but at least 22 states are expected to outlaw abortion in nearly all instances as soon as the Supreme Court gives them the go-ahead. A draft opinion leaked from the court last month revealed that the justices were planning to toss out nearly 50 years of abortion protections established by Roe v. Wade and let states rule on the matter without federal oversight. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Senate Advances Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill With Hopes Of Passing It This Week,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan bill aimed at curbing gun violence cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday, less than a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, ignited calls for action in Congress. The vote to advance the bill was 64-34. Fourteen Republicans joined Democrats in support of the measure, and senators now expect its final passage later this week. The bill, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms, and aid for mental health and schools. It was agreed to after weeks of painstaking negotiations by a core group of four senators ― Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “Today, we finalized bipartisan, commonsense legislation to protect America’s children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across our country,” the senators announced in a statement earlier on Tuesday. “Our legislation will save lives and will not infringe on any law-abiding American’s Second Amendment rights.” The bill includes funding to bolster mental health, enhanced background checks for people under 21, incentives for states to adopt “red flag” laws, and school security measures. It would close the “boyfriend loophole,” a last-minute hang-up in the negotiations, by prohibiting romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. And it includes the first comprehensive federal criminal statute banning gun trafficking and straw purchasing. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, safe storage rules at home, or required background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. “This bipartisan gun-safety legislation is progress and will save lives. While it is not everything we want, this legislation is urgently-needed,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement on Tuesday, pledging to quickly bring it to the floor for a final vote. In a rare move, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). also backed the agreement in a statement issued by his office. “For years, the far left falsely claimed that Congress could only address the terrible issue of mass murders by trampling on law-abiding Americans’ constitutional rights. This bill proves that false,” McConnell said. Still, the bill is likely to face substantial opposition on the right. The National Rifle Association announced it would oppose the legislation immediately after it was made public on Tuesday evening. The group said the agreement “can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, and use federal dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state and local politicians.” Cornyn, the lead GOP negotiator, was hit with a barrage of boos over the weekend during an appearance at the Texas GOP Convention in Houston. He has defended the bill, saying it doesn’t infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Yet in what is perhaps a testament to changing politics on guns following recent mass shootings, including the one that took place in Uvalde, more than a dozen Republican senators voted to advance the bill on Tuesday. Murphy, the lead Democratic negotiator and a vocal gun control advocate after the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, emphasized the deal is a product of what is possible in today’s narrowly divided Senate. “This bill doesn’t include everything I want, but it will save countless lives and finally break a 30 year political logjam. I look forward to earning bipartisan support for this historic legislation among my Senate colleagues this week,” he said in a statement.

2,South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg Convicted On 2 Impeachment Charges,politics," PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Senate on Tuesday convicted Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg of two impeachment charges stemming from a 2020 car crash in which he killed a pedestrian, immediately removing him and barring him from serving in public office again. Ravnsborg told a 911 dispatcher the night of the crash that he might have struck a deer or other large animal, and has said he didn’t know he struck a man — 55-year-old Joseph Boever — until he returned to the scene the next morning. Criminal investigators said they didn’t believe some of Ravnsborg’s statements.. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to convict Ravnsborg, a Republican, of committing crimes that caused someone’s death, and malfeasance for misleading law enforcement and abusing the powers of his office. Ravnsborg’s face showed little emotion as the vote on the first article of impeachment went down to the final senator’s vote and passed with the minimum needed for conviction. He held his hand over his mouth as he had for much of the trial, then wrote a note on a notepad in his lap. The convictions required a two-thirds majority. Ravnsborg, who was in his first term, is the first official to be impeached and convicted in South Dakota history. Gov. Kristi Noem, who pushed for Ravnsborg’s impeachment, will appoint his replacement. The impeachment votes close a chapter that has roiled state politics, pitting Noem against Ravnsborg and some in her own party who objected to her aggressive pursuit of his removal. As the impeachment trial opened Tuesday, prosecutors drove at a question that has hung over developments since the September 2020 crash: Did Ravnsborg know he killed a man the night of the crash? “He absolutely saw the man that he struck in the moments after,” said Alexis Tracy, the Clay County state’s attorney who is leading the prosecution. Prosecutors also told senators that Ravnsborg had used his title “to set the tone and gain influence” in the aftermath of the crash, even as he allegedly made “misstatements and outright lies” to the crash investigators. The prosecution played a montage of audio clips of Ravnsborg referring to himself as the attorney general. As they questioned crash investigators, prosecuting attorneys probed Ravnsborg’s alleged misstatements during the aftermath of the crash, including that he never drove excessively over the speed limit, that he had reached out to Boever’s family to offer his condolence, and that he had not been browsing his phone during his drive home. The prosecution played a series of video clips during their closing arguments that showed Ravnsborg’s shifting account of his phone use during interviews with criminal investigators. The attorney general at first outright denied he had been using his phone while driving, but then acknowledged he had been looking at his phone minutes before the crash. Ravnsborg has maintained that he did nothing wrong and cast the impeachment trial as a chance to clear himself. He resolved the criminal case last year by pleading no contest to a pair of traffic misdemeanors, including making an illegal lane change and using a phone while driving, and was fined by a judge. He appeared in the Senate chamber Tuesday but did not testify. His defense attorney answered senators’ questions. The attorney general’s defense focused its arguments on the implications of impeachment during opening statements Tuesday, imploring lawmakers to consider the implications of their decision on the function of state government. Ravnsborg tapped Ross Garber, a legal analyst and law professor at Tulane University who specializes in impeachment proceedings. “This is undoing the will of the voters,” Garber told the Senate. “Make no mistake, that’s what you’re considering doing.” Ravnsborg was driving home from a political fundraiser after dark on Sept. 12, 2020, on a state highway in central South Dakota when his car struck “something,” according to a transcript of his 911 call afterward. He later said it might have been a deer or other animal. Investigators identified what they thought were slips in Ravnsborg’s statements, such as when he said he turned around at the accident scene and “saw him” before quickly correcting himself and saying: “I didn’t see him.” And they contended that Boever’s face had come through Ravnsborg’s windshield because his glasses were found in the car. “We’ve heard better lies from 5-year-olds,” Pennington County State’s Attorney Mark Vargo, who was acting as an impeachment prosecutor, said of Ravnsborg’s statement. Investigators had determined the attorney general walked right past Boever’s body and the flashlight Boever had been carrying — still illuminated the next morning — as he looked around the scene the night of the crash. Ravnsborg said neither he nor the county sheriff who came to the scene knew that Boever’s body was lying just feet from the pavement on the highway shoulder. “There isn’t any way you can go by without seeing that,” Arnie Rummel, an agent with the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation who led the criminal probe, said in testimony Tuesday. Rummel added that Ravnsborg had hardly behaved like someone who had hit a deer — a common occurrence on the highways of South Dakota. Prosecutors also raised an exchange that Ravnsborg had with one of his staff members three days following the crash, after he had submitted his phones to crash investigators. Ravnsborg questioned an agent in the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation about what would turn up during forensic exams of his cellphones, even though the agency was supposed to have no part in the investigation to avoid conflicts of interest. “We were not supposed to be involved,” the now-retired agent, Brent Gromer, said as he described why the exchange made him uncomfortable. Ravnsborg’s defense attorney contended that the attorney general had done nothing nefarious and instead had cooperated fully with the crash investigation. His defense attorney, Mike Butler, described any discrepancies in Ravnsborg’s memory of that night as owing to human error. Butler disparaged the testimony from Rummel, the crash investigator, as “opinion” that would not hold up in a court of law. Ravnsborg was willing to take a polygraph test, though criminal investigators determined that it would not have been effective to test the attorney general’s truthfulness. During closing arguments, Butler stated that the criminal prosecution found “no criminal culpability” for Boever’s death and urged senators to refrain from rehashing that case. “No amount of fire and brimstone changes that given fact,” he said. Noem called for Ravnsborg to resign soon after the crash and later pressed lawmakers to pursue impeachment. Noem also publicly endorsed Ravnsborg’s predecessor, Republican Marty Jackley, for election as his replacement. Ravnsborg has argued that the governor, who has positioned herself for a possible 2024 White House bid, pushed for his removal in part because he had investigated ethics complaints against Noem. Ravnsborg in September agreed to an undisclosed settlement with Boever’s widow. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,7 Major Takeaways From The Jan. 6 Committee's Fourth Hearing,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost The House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack held its fourth public hearing Tuesday, this time focusing on the intense pressure campaign led by former President Donald Trump as he scrambled to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Through live and recorded testimony, text messages, video and audio segments, the panel showed how the effort to keep Trump in power for another four years was extensive and unrelenting. Trump’s team took particular aim at fellow Republicans in swing states who might have been in positions to sway the final outcome, either by falsely revising the final tallies, meddling with the Electoral College or saying evidence of fraud had been found. But there was zero evidence of election fraud on a scale that could have affected the results. Fueled by the wrath of his supporters, Trump’s anger at having lost the election put him on a direct path to lighting the spark that ignited on Jan. 6, 2021, with the deadly attack on the Capitol building, according to the committee. Here are seven of the the biggest takeaways. The committee presented evidence showing how Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis aggressively lobbied officials in swing states, including Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, to help them try to overturn the election results. In audio clips played at the hearing, Giuliani and Ellis can be heard calling Bryan Cutler, the Republican speaker of Pennsylvania’s state House of Representatives, several days in a row in late November. “I really have something important to call to your attention that I think really changes things,” Giuliani said in one call. According to the committee, Cutler found this inappropriate and directed his lawyers to tell Giuliani to stop calling, but Giuliani would not back down. Russel “Rusty” Bowers, the Republican speaker of Arizona’s state House of Representatives, said the pair put similar pressure on him. He recalled Giuliani telling him, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.” The lawyers offered to provide evidence, Bowers testified, but never did. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, testified that his office tirelessly pursued allegations of election fraud, opening nearly 300 separate investigations, but came up empty. In one case, Trump’s team claimed that 66,000 underage voters were counted, but Raffensperger’s office found no evidence to back it up. “The numbers are the numbers. We investigated every allegation,” Raffensperger testified. He said his team “ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate.” Trump had infamously told the Georgia official he needed to “find” just enough votes for Trump to win the state. On Tuesday, Raffensperger testified: “What I knew is we didn’t have any votes to find. There were no votes to find.” Ruby Freeman, who said she used to go by Lady Ruby, was a poll worker in Georgia during the 2020 election. She and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, found themselves personally attacked by Trump and his supporters in the wake of the election as Trump repeatedly fueled the idea that the vote had been rigged against him. Moss testified with her mother sitting behind her. Portions of Freeman’s videotaped testimony were also played at the hearing. The women said their lives had been upended by abuse that came online and in person after Giuliani shared security camera footage of the pair counting ballots. Trump’s team accused the women of counting “suitcases” of fake ballots that favored Biden. “Nowhere. There is nowhere I feel safe. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one,” Freeman said in her recorded testimony. She left her home for two months in early 2021 amid the harassment, which included death threats. Freeman added: “But he targeted me, Lady Ruby. A proud American citizen who stood up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of a pandemic.” Moss said she felt guilty for exposing her family to so much hate: “I felt bad for picking this job, for always being the one who wants to help.” She also cleared up an accusation Giuliani made that she and Freeman were passing a USB drive back and forth while working. It was nothing but a ginger mint, she said. Michigan’s state Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said that after Trump publicly shared his phone number, he received around 4,000 text messages. Bowers said his office in Arizona was inundated with phone calls, emails and text messages from Trump supporters, making it hard for his staff to communicate with one another. The pressure on Bowers led to personal attacks at his home, where his adult daughter was dying of a chronic illness. During his testimony, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voter system implementation manager, was asked about angry and impassioned remarks he made before the attack on the Capitol, warning that somebody was going to get hurt if the personal attacks on his colleagues didn’t stop. The Republican official said the “straw that broke the camel’s back” came after Trump supporters began targeting a contractor who worked for Dominion Voting Systems. Someone Sterling normally regarded as “pretty unflappable” called to tell him about it. “I did pull up Twitter. I scroll through it, and there’s a particular tweet,” Sterling testified. “It had his name, ‘You’ve committed treason. May God have mercy on your soul.’ And a slowly twisting GIF of a noose.” The attackers also turned to Raffensperger. He testified that Trump supporters threatened his wife with sexual violence and that some had broken into the home of his daughter-in-law, a widow with two children. Bowers refuted a statement Trump sent Tuesday just before the hearing began in which he claimed the Arizona lawmaker told him he supported the idea that the 2020 presidential election had been “stolen.” “I did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn’t it,” Bowers testified, adding he never called it a rigged election to “anyone, anywhere, anytime.” Trump claimed the opposite in his statement, writing that Bowers “told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.” John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump, told Bowers to just hold a vote to decertify Arizona’s electors “and let the courts sort it out.” Bowers testified that he replied: “You are asking me to do something that’s never been done in the history of the United States.” Bowers also testified that Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) called him the morning of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to count the electoral votes. “He asked if I would sign on both to a letter that had been sent from my state and/or that I would support a decertification of the electors, and I said I would not,” Bowers said of his conversation with Biggs. Other witnesses have told the committee Biggs was closely involved in planning the rally that led to the Capitol riot. Damning text messages displayed at the hearing revealed that, shortly before Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to certify the election results, Johnson aide Sean Riley contacted Pence staffer Chris Hodgson to say the senator wanted to “hand” Pence an “alternate slate of electors for [Michigan] and [Wisconsin] because the archivist didn’t receive them.” Hodgson responded: “Do not give that to him.” A representative of Johnson, who is running for reelection in Wisconsin, issued a statement Tuesday saying the senator “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office. This was a staff to staff exchange. His new Chief of Staff contacted the Vice President’s office.” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel shared details of a potentially damning phone conversation Trump initiated. The former president called her, she said, and then handed the phone to Eastman, who pressured her to help with the plan to install pro-Trump electors. The committee showed video of testimony in which she described the call and the aid the RNC would give. “Essentially, he turned the call over to Mr. Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges that were ongoing changed the result of any of the states,” McDaniel said.

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

5,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one.

10,Biden Trades Sharp Words With Chevron Chief Over High Gas Prices,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — In a pointed back and forth, the head of Chevron complained Tuesday that President Joe Biden has vilified energy firms at a time when gasoline prices are at near record levels and the president responded that the oil company CEO was being “mildly sensitive.” The president in recent weeks has criticized oil producers and refiners for maximizing profits and making “more money than God,” rather than increasing production in response to higher prices as the economy recovers from the pandemic and feels the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Michael Wirth, chairman and CEO of Chevron, sent Biden a letter via email on Tuesday that said the president’s own words have been self-defeating in terms of encouraging companies to boost their output. Chevron is investing in more production, Wirth wrote, but “your Administration has largely sought to criticize, and at times vilify, our industry. These actions are not beneficial to meeting the challenges we face and are not what the American people deserve.” The oil company CEO said he wanted a more cooperative relationship with the government. “Let’s work together,” Wirth wrote. “The American people rightly expect our country’s leaders and industry to address the challenges they are facing in a serious and resolute manner.” Asked about those comments, Biden displayed no sympathy. “He’s mildly sensitive,” Biden said. “I didn’t know they’d get their feelings hurt that quickly. Look, we need more refining capacity. This idea that they don’t have oil to drill and to bring up is simply not true.” Average gas prices are nearly $5 a gallon nationwide, a strain on commuters and a political albatross for Biden’s fellow Democrats going into the midterm elections. That has left the White House scrambling for solutions, including a possible suspension of the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax .Biden plans to decide by the end of the week if the tax should be suspended, a move meant to relieve price pressures and that would need approval from a reluctant Congress. The gas tax funds highways, but Biden said Tuesday any lost revenue would not have a major impact on road construction because of last year’s $1 trillion infrastructure law. The clash between the Biden administration and oil producers and refiners unfolded ahead of a Thursday meeting that Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will hold with energy companies. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have previously voiced skepticism about the benefits of suspending the gas tax. But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is sponsoring a bill that would put the gas tax on hold through the end of 2023. Schiff said in a statement that he has been in touch with the White House to encourage the gas tax holiday, adding, “But we shouldn’t stop there. We should also hold Big Oil accountable for the price-gouging that is driving prices up in the first place.” The House has approved legislation to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies, but the bill has stalled in the Senate. Democratic proposals to impose a “windfall profits” tax on oil producers have generated little support in Congress. The possibility of a gas tax holiday has drawn criticism from economists and the business community for not fixing the underlying supply challenges. In an address Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York, a non-profit, non-partisan business group, Target CEO Brian Cornell called the gas tax holiday a temporary “mini stimulus” that does nothing to fundamentally change the supply and demand curve for fuel and transportation. “We have a classic supply-and-demand challenge,” Cornell told the audience. ”In all due respect, the gas holiday is only going to fuel demand. It’s doing nothing to increase the supply.” Harvard University professor Jason Furman, formerly the top economist in the Obama White House, said a gas tax suspension would not address the supply pressures. “Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic,” he wrote on Twitter. “Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry ― with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the administration is looking into as many ways as possible to provide consumers with some relief at the gas pump. But the administration does not plan to tell Americans to drive less during the July 4 holiday and reduce some of the supply pressures. “Americans are going to do what they feel is right for themselves and for their family,” Jean-Pierre said. “That’s not something for us to make a judgment on.” ___ AP reporters Matthew Daly in Washington and Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

11,Georgia Election Workers On Trump-Fueled Nightmare: 'There Is Nowhere I Feel Safe',politics," Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost A mother and daughter from Georgia who worked on the 2020 presidential election told lawmakers at a Tuesday congressional hearing that former President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the vote upended their lives and left them deeply traumatized. “I have lost my name and I have lost my reputation,” Ruby Freeman said in a pretaped interview aired at the hearing. “I have lost my sense of security. All because a group of people, starting with Number 45 and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me to push their own lies about how the presidential election was stolen.” Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, Freeman’s daughter, testified that she no longer feels comfortable leaving home, even to go to the grocery store, and that she now second-guesses everything she does. Moss has also quit her job as an election worker ― which she said she valued because her grandmother emphasized the importance of voting, and she liked helping older voters ― after 10 years of service. In the weeks after the November 2020 vote, Trump and his attorney Giuliani promoted a video of Freeman and Moss on election night, falsely claiming that it showed them meddling on behalf of Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The accusation circulated widely among Trump supporters, who hurled abuse and threats at the two women ― and even at Moss’ grandmother. At the hearing, organized by the House committee investigating how Trump’s election lies spurred the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Moss said she learned of the video when two of her colleagues showed it to her and warned that she was facing attacks online. She then checked her Facebook inbox, where she found violent messages and assertions that she and Freeman, who are both Black, would be imprisoned. The invective included racist attacks, Moss said, like the statement “Be glad that it’s 2020 and not 1920.” In a Dec. 10, 2020, Zoom call with Georgia legislators, Giuliani personally employed racist tropes when talking about Moss and Freeman, claiming that they could be seen in the video “passing around USB ports as if they’re vials of heroin or cocaine.” Rather than some kind of USB device, what Freeman actually handed her daughter in that video was a ginger mint, Moss said. People who believed the Trump team’s narrative eventually went to the home of Moss’ grandmother and tried to force their way in, claiming they would carry out a citizen’s arrest of Moss and Freeman. “This woman is my everything ... I told her, ‘Close the door. Don’t open the door for anyone,’” Moss said. “She is a 70-something-year-old woman, and she doesn’t like having restrictions. She wants to answer the door. She likes to get her steps in walking around the neighborhood. I had to tell her, ‘You can’t do that. You have to be safe.’” “I felt horrible for picking this job and being the one who always wants to help and is always there, never missing out on one election,” she said. “I just felt like it was my fault, putting my family in this situation.” As Trump ramped up his efforts to cling to power ahead of Jan. 6 ― the date on which Biden’s legitimate victory would be certified ― the FBI approached Freeman to warn that her home might also be targeted, and that she should find another place to stay. “I can’t believe this person has caused this much damage to me and my family, to have to leave my home that I have lived at for 21 years,” Freeman said. “It was horrible.” Beyond the initial fear and chaos, the smear campaign had a broad, lasting impact, both women said. They still worry about their names being publicly mentioned by waitstaff at a restaurant or by a family member, and Freeman said she will never again wear the shirt she wore that election night, which proclaimed her as “Lady Ruby.” “There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you?” Freeman said. “The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one. But he targeted me, Lady Ruby, a small-business owner, a mother, a proud American citizen who would stand up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of the pandemic.” Moss and Freeman are currently suing Giuliani. They also sued the pro-Trump media outlet One America News, which agreed to a settlement with them in April.

12,Rudy Giuliani Had 'Lots Of Theories' About Voter Fraud 'But No Evidence': Arizona Official,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rudy Giuliani apparently didn’t let a little thing like “facts” stop him from trying to get one Arizona Republican official to replace Joe Biden’s electors with a group that supported then-President Donald Trump. In fact, Trump’s personal lawyer told Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers that, although he had “lots of theories” as to why Trump really won the 2020 presidential election, he just didn’t “have the evidence.” During Tuesday’s hearing of the House select committee investigating the events before and on Jan. 6, 2021, Bowers said he repeatedly pressed the former New York City mayor for actual proof of election fraud but never received the evidence Giuliani claimed to have and promised to send. Bowers told the committee that he recalled Giuliani telling him, ″’We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence.’” Bowers added: “And I don’t know if that was a gaffe or maybe he didn’t think through what he said, but both myself and others in my group … both remember that specifically, and afterwards we kind of laughed about it.” Bowers said he kept asking Trump’s team for proof of Giuliani’s claims but said they never handed it over. News that Giuliani had no proof of the election lies he was propagating set off strong reactions among Twitter users. Watching these hearings is a constant reminder that  Rudy Giuliani is just a predatory racist thug, equal parts ridiculous and malevolent in this, his final gum-smacking chapter. Just a nasty piece of work and a big ol' sleaze-ball. Literally a neutral & accurate summation of how Giuliani comes off in these hearings: A bottom-feeding lickspittle, an atrocious lawyer & a laughably bad liar. Oh, the evidence in my other suit back home. Wait, look over there, it's a black person nefariously...doing their job. https://t.co/X9Tm7g7Ii7 An unexpected upside to the utter hell of Trump’s efforts to subvert democracy is unassailable confirmation that Giuliani is the absolute piece of rubbish Black folks always knew he was.

13,Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar Survives Second Progressive Primary Challenge,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost LAREDO, Texas — Nearly a month after voting ended, Rep. Henry Cuellar, the last House Democrat opposed to abortion rights, officially clinched the Democratic nomination in Texas’ 28th Congressional District. For the second election cycle in a row, Cuellar defeated progressive attorney Jessica Cisneros. The Associated Press called the race on Tuesday. After an initial canvass of ballots cast, Cuellar led Cisneros by 281 votes, prompting him to declare victory. Cisneros exercised her right to demand a recount at her campaign’s expense. But the recount, which concluded on Tuesday, increased Cuellar’s lead by a few votes, according to the Texas Democratic Party. Cuellar “was someone who national groups targeted, but who consistently held that he was a good member for that district,” said Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, Austin. “At the end of the day, when you’ve run successfully in a district multiple times, you know where to turn voters out.” The outcome is a win for House Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who stood by Cuellar despite pressure from Cisneros and other progressives to drop him. Party leaders evidently believed Cuellar’s argument that a socially conservative nominee is the best bet against a Republican in Texas’ 28th, which snakes from San Antonio to Laredo and points southeast along the U.S.-Mexico border. Cuellar is set to face the Republican nominee, Cassy Garcia, who is a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — and the resources of a national Republican Party determined to consolidate former President Donald Trump’s gains in South Texas. Hillary Clinton bested Trump in Texas’ 28th by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016, but Joe Biden defeated him there by just four points in 2020. Redistricting in 2021 made the seat slightly more Democratic. Biden would have won in the new boundaries by 7 percentage points ― giving the seat a Democratic tilt, but not one that is insurmountable for Republicans during a likely GOP wave year. “I would ask anybody: Which is more important — to have a pro-life Democrat or to have an anti-abortion Republican?” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said at a rally in support of Cuellar in San Antonio in early May. “Because come November, that could very well be the choice in this district.” But Cuellar’s victory is also a major disappointment for progressives who were hoping to get rid of him. Cuellar, 66, is a longtime ally of the fossil fuel industry and the National Rifle Association. He inspires contempt on the left — from climate activists to labor unions, pro-choice groups to pro-Palestine advocates — more than any other Democrat in the House of Representatives. Among other recent strikes against him, Cuellar was the only Democrat to vote against both the PRO Act bill to expand union rights and the Women’s Health Protection Act to codify a federal right to abortion access. As a result, Cisneros’ second challenge against Cuellar, which came to a close on May 24 — her 29th birthday — became yet another expensive proxy battle between interest groups with different visions for the Democratic Party. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super PAC spent over $1.8 million to reelect Cuellar, and Mainstream Democrats, a centrist super PAC funded in significant part by billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, kicked in nearly $800,000 on his behalf. On the other side, super PACs tied to the pro-choice group EMILY’s List, the Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats, the left-wing group that recruited Cisneros to run, spent more than $1.5 million supporting Cisneros. Cisneros got a jolt of momentum in January when the FBI raided Cuellar’s home in Laredo as part of a federal probe reportedly associated with Azerbaijan’s influence peddling in Congress. She ended up trailing Cuellar by just two percentage points during the first round of primary voting on March 1. The presence of a third Democrat — Tannya Benavides, a former educator who later endorsed Cisneros — prevented Cuellar from obtaining an outright majority on the first ballot, prompting the May 24 runoff election. The political winds again broke Cisneros’ way when a draft of a Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade leaked at the beginning of May. The announcement increased the salience of a key area of contrast between Cisneros, who is pro-choice, and Cuellar, who opposes legalizing abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and danger to the health of the pregnant person. “With the House majority on the line, he could very much be the deciding vote on the future of our reproductive rights and we cannot afford to take that risk,” Cisneros declared. Locally, Cisneros also made the case that Cuellar’s seniority and the federal funds he helped secure through his seat on the House Appropriations Committee had not adequately raised living standards in Laredo. She singled out the city’s tap water crisis as a reflection of the shortcomings of a political class led by Cuellar. Voters supporting Cisneros in Laredo’s less prosperous South Side told HuffPost that they were backing her in the hopes of bringing change to the region’s political culture and economy. “It’s just hard for low-income people, especially on the South Side,” said Christian Aviles, a trucking company dispatcher who opposes abortion rights but still voted for Cisneros. “After all these years, I think there’s not enough being done.” But Cuellar’s allies worked to muddy the waters on reproductive rights. Mainstream Democrats funded an ad claiming Cuellar would protect abortion rights. Unknown entities sympathetic to Cuellar also funded a billboard and a mock newspaper falsely claiming that Cisneros’ romantic relationship with her former schoolteacher had derailed the educator’s subsequent marriage. And in a low-turnout runoff, Cuellar was able to count on the support of Laredo’s generally older, socially conservative voters worried that Cisneros was insufficiently supportive of border enforcement and capitalism. Cuellar has “done a good job,” said Alejandro Vela Jr., who runs an engine repair business with his father on Laredo’s South Side. “You see the situation of illegal aliens coming? You need somebody — you don’t want to cut border patrol.” Vela voted for Barack Obama twice, then voted for Trump twice. He said he would vote for the Republican nominee if Cisneros won the primary. HuffPost asked Vela whether he thought Cisneros would be too dovish on border policy. “Yes,” Vela replied before gesturing toward his father, who had accompanied him to vote. “She’s a socialist — everything my dad went to fight against in Vietnam.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Raffensperger’s Wife Received ‘Sexualized’ Threats Amid Trump’s Campaign To Steal The Election,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s wife received “sexualized threats” from supporters of President Donald Trump after Raffensperger refused to go along with Trump’s plot to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he testified Tuesday before a House select committee. “After the election, my email, my cellphone was doxxed, and so I was getting texts [from] all over the country. And then eventually my wife started getting texts. Hers typically came in sexualized texts, which were disgusting,” Raffensperger said during the House Jan. 6 committee’s fourth public hearing, which focused on threats against state and local election officials in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. “They started going after her probably to put pressure on me: ‘Why don’t you just quit and walk away?’” Raffensperger said. The barrage of threats occurred as Raffensperger publicly and privately refuted Trump’s claims that the presidential vote in Georgia, which Trump lost, had been marred by fraud. Leaders of the House Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating the events surrounding Trump’s attempts to overturn the election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that followed, used the hearing to paint Trump as responsible for the litany of threats received by Raffensperger, his family and other state and local officials who refused to assist Trump in undermining American democracy. The now-infamous Jan. 2, 2021, phone call in which Trump urged Raffensperger to “find” roughly 12,000 votes to overturn the state’s election result was key to those efforts: During Raffensperger’s testimony, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) played portions of the call in which Trump warned Raffensperger that it was “very dangerous” to dispute the president’s claims of fraud. Trump pushed a conspiracy theory that Atlanta-area election workers had shipped in suitcases of ballots to tilt the election results, and he argued without evidence that thousands of dead voters had cast ballots in the contest. “I watched you this morning, and you said there was no criminality,” Trump told Raffensperger, referring to a news conference in which the secretary of state had reiterated that no widespread voter fraud or other irregularities had occurred in Georgia. “All of this stuff is very dangerous stuff, when you talk about no criminality. I think it’s very dangerous for you to say that.” Trump also insinuated that Raffensperger could face criminal liability for refusing to go along with the plot to steal the election away from Joe Biden, according to portions of the call played during the hearing. “The ballots are corrupt, which is totally illegal,” Trump told Raffensperger. “It’s more illegal for you than it is for them, because you know what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal offense, and you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk.” Raffensperger interpreted both as threats during the call, he wrote in a book released last year. He implied again on Tuesday that Trump bore responsibility for the dangers his family have faced since. Raffensperger also testified that his daughter-in-law’s house was broken into after the election. “My son has passed, and she’s a widow, and she has two kids,” Raffensperger said. “So we’re very concerned about her safety also.” Reuters previously reported the break-in, which neither the committee nor Raffensperger detailed further at the hearing. The news service also reported last year that death threats and other threats of violence against Raffensperger and his wife, Tricia, continued for months after the 2020 election and that they spent a week in hiding and canceled regular visits with family in an effort to stay safe. Members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, showed up outside their home, Reuters reported. Arizona state House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified on Tuesday that he received similar threats after he refused to embrace Trump’s lies about election fraud or help him overturn the results in his state, which Trump had also lost by a narrow margin. Bowers told the committee that he still worries about “what will happen on Saturdays” because of angry protests that have taken place outside his home. He said that he had witnessed an armed protester wearing a vest that bore the insignia of the Three Percenters, another right-wing militia organization, confronting one of his neighbors. Bowers said his concerns were heightened because his “gravely ill daughter” was in the house during the worst of the threats. In previous hearings, the Jan. 6 committee has presented testimony showing that members of Trump’s inner circle, including former Attorney General William Barr, had told him that there was no evidence of fraud in the election and that his attempts to overturn the results were unlikely to work. Tuesday’s hearing sought to build the case that Trump knowingly put state election officials and their families in danger anyway. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House select committee, said after Tuesday’s hearing that he did not “have a complete answer” when HuffPost asked if anyone had received threats for testifying in front of it. “We are obviously deeply invested in the security of all of our witnesses,” Raskin said. “We want to make sure that there are no reprisals and no retaliation against any of our witnesses. What we saw from Georgia is truly a threat to the rule of law in our country. The idea that people can be intimidated by the president of the United States just for doing their jobs and then subjected to a campaign of private intimidation and threats afterward ― that’s unacceptable in the United States of America.” Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,More Than 200 Abortion Clinics Will Close If The Supreme Court Overturns Roe,politics," Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost More than 200 abortion clinics will have to immediately close if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, according to a new report. The report, published by leading research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, analyzed the changing landscape of abortion facilities in the U.S. between 2017 and 2021. ANSIRH found that the repeal of Roe, the 1973 landmark decision that affords federal abortion protections, could lead to the closure of at least 202 abortion clinics — just over a quarter of all abortion facilities — across the country. Most of these clinic closures would be linked to trigger laws, which would immediately ban or severely restrict abortion access in 26 states if Roe falls. The closures would hit the South and Midwest the hardest. “That estimate is concerning to me because there are already so few clinics based on this report in those states,” Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, the author of the report and an associate professor at ANSIRH, said of states with trigger laws. “And they’re also really close together ― they’re in the South and in the Midwest, and it just means that it’s creating vast geographies that will no longer offer abortion care.” The demand for abortion care has actually increased in recent years, according to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research organization. After decades of decline in abortion care, there was an 8% increase in abortions preformed between 2017 and 2020. Still, the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The case centers on a Mississippi 15-week abortion restriction, and it seeks to move the federal 24-week gestational limit to 15 weeks or repeal Roe. A leaked draft decision published in May revealed that the court’s conservative majority is poised to overturn Roe altogether. The court’s final decision is expected to be handed down before July 1. ANSIRH’s report, co-authored with the Abortion Facility Database Project, also found that the number of clinics that provide only medication abortion increased between 2017 and 2021— a change that is likely due to the Food and Drug Administration’s loosening of certain restrictions on abortion pills during the pandemic. But the increase in clinics providing abortion pills mostly occurred in blue states or regions that already had a lot of clinics. Upadhyay pointed out that the increase in medication-abortion-only clinics in blue states will be a barrier for abortion patients traveling from red states. “As a consequence of abortion bans, people will be pushed later into pregnancy for when they need an abortion. So they will need to seek abortion facilities that offer abortion care later in pregnancy,” she said. “But the trend that we’re seeing, even in the protected access states, is that more and more clinics are medication abortion only, so they only offer abortion up to about 12 weeks at the most,” Upadhyay said. “Once they get to those protected access states they’re more likely to find clinics that offer medication abortion only, which they won’t be eligible for.” The ANSIRH report also found that the number of abortion facilities around the U.S. increased between 2017 and 2021. But the changes in clinic numbers and access heavily depended on the area of the country. During that time period, for example, 25 abortion clinics opened in the South — but another 48 clinics closed. And Florida — which has had the third largest number of abortion clinics in the U.S., after California and New York, and has been a destination for many in the Southeast who needed abortion care — will likely see closures soon. The state recently passed a 15-week ban that goes into effect next month. As of last year, nine states had no more than two abortion facilities. And six states only had one abortion clinic, including Mississippi, South Dakota and West Virginia. “We know that restricted access states have higher populations of people of color and we know that people of color and low-income people are going to be the most affected by these bans,” said Upadhyay. “We can’t assume that this is going to have a blanket impact on all people in restricted access states.” Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,GOP Sen. Ron Johnson Tried To Give Mike Pence Fake Ballots,politics," Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence just before he certified the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to text messages that congressional investigators released during a Tuesday hearing. Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, contacted Pence staffer Chris Hodgson to say the senator wanted “to hand something” to Pence. When Hodgson asked what it was, Riley responded: “Alternate slate of electors for [Michigan] and [Wisconsin] because archivist didn’t receive them.” “Do not give that to him,” Hodgson responded. As then-President Donald Trump sought to deny Joe Biden’s election win, his team asked supporters to falsely claim that they were the electors who represented the states’ voters ― and to sign phony slates purportedly delivering Electoral College votes to Trump. The strategy sought to prevent Pence’s certification of the real Electoral College result on Jan. 6, 2021. During its fourth public hearing, the House committee investigating Trump supporters’ attack on the U.S. Capitol that day unveiled the text messages between Riley and Hodgson and an additional message from a top Republican official. In a Jan. 4 text, Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Mark Jefferson wrote: “Freaking trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the senate President.” The revelation that Johnson tried to give Pence false ballots creates a clear link between the senator and the campaign to overturn the 2020 election. And it underscores the range of public and private ways that prominent Republicans supported Trump’s bid to defy voters and hold on to power while fueling the outrage that drove the assault on the Capitol. Johnson was not one of the 139 Republican lawmakers who voted to uphold Trump’s election lies. He did, however, host a December 2020 hearing during which Trump allies spent hours promoting conspiracy theories about the previous month’s election. Soon after the news broke, Johnson’s spokesperson Alexa Henning tweeted, “The senator had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.” “The Vice President’s office said not to give it to him and we did not. There was no further action taken. End of story,” Henning continued. The senator later told reporters that he knew on the morning of Jan. 6 that “somebody” delivered the false ballots to his office but denied that he was trying to push the fake pro-Trump electors. “I do not know [the source]. I have no idea,” Johnson said. “This was a staff-to-staff exchange, and I was basically unaware of it. The chief of staff contacted the vice president’s staff and said, ‘Do you want this?’ They said no, and we didn’t deliver it and that’s the end of the story.” Johnson is currently running for reelection in Wisconsin. One of his potential rivals, Democratic hopeful Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, issued a statement about Johnson’s actions on Tuesday afternoon. “Ron Johnson actively tried to undermine this democracy,” Barnes said. “Once again, Ron Johnson has proven he’s a danger to our country and our fundamental rights. I’m calling for him to resign immediately.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

1,"South Dakota AG Lied About Fatal Crash, Impeachment Prosecutors Say",politics," PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg lied to investigators and abused the power of his office after he struck and killed a pedestrian, prosecutors argued Tuesday at the opening of an impeachment trial that could remove him from office. Ravnsborg’s attorneys countered that such an action would improperly undo the will of voters for what he has maintained was an accident. He has insisted that he did not realize he struck and killed pedestrian Joseph Boever until he returned to the crash site the next day and discovered the 55-year-old’s body. Ravnsborg has said he first believed he hit a deer or large animal. Ravnsborg, a Republican who only recently announced he wouldn’t seek a second term, faces two charges in the state’s first-ever impeachment trial. Criminal investigators, some lawmakers and the victim’s family questioned Ravnsborg’s truthfulness over his actions following the 2020 crash. Senators may also vote on whether Ravnsborg should be barred from holding future office. Either way, the outcome of a proceeding expected to take two days will close a chapter that has roiled state politics, pitting Republican Gov. Kristi Noem against Ravnsborg and some in her own party who objected to her aggressive pursuit of his removal. As the two-day impeachment trial opened Tuesday, prosecutors drove at a question that has hung over developments since the September 2020 crash: Did Ravnsborg know he killed a man the night of the crash? “He absolutely saw the man that he struck in the moments after,” said Alexis Tracy, the Clay County state’s attorney who is leading the prosecution. Prosecutors also told senators that Ravnsborg had used his title “to set the tone and gain influence” in the aftermath of the crash, even as he allegedly made “misstatements and outright lies” to the crash investigators. The prosecution played a montage of audio clips of Ravnsborg referring to himself as the attorney general. As they questioned crash investigators, prosecuting attorneys probed Ravnsborg’s alleged misstatements during the aftermath of the crash, including that he never drove excessively over the speed limit, that he had reached out to Boever’s family to offer his condolence, and that he had not been browsing his phone during his drive home. Ravnsborg has maintained that he did nothing wrong and cast the impeachment trial as a chance to clear himself. He resolved the criminal case last year by pleading no contest to a pair of traffic misdemeanors, including making an illegal lane change and using a phone while driving, and was fined by a judge. The attorney general’s defense focused its arguments on the implications of impeachment during opening statements Tuesday, imploring lawmakers to consider the implications of their decision on the function of state government. Ravnsborg tapped Ross Garber, a legal analyst and law professor at Tulane University who specializes in impeachment proceedings. “This is undoing the will of the voters,” Garber told the Senate. “Make no mistake, that’s what you’re considering doing.” Ravnsborg was driving home from a political fundraiser after dark on Sept. 12, 2020, on a state highway in central South Dakota when his car struck “something,” according to a transcript of his 911 call afterward. He later said it might have been a deer or other animal. Investigators identified what they thought were slips in Ravnsborg’s statements, such as when he said he turned around at the accident scene and “saw him” before quickly correcting himself and saying: “I didn’t see him.” And they contended that Boever’s face had come through Ravnsborg’s windshield because his glasses were found in the car. Investigators had determined the attorney general walked right past Boever’s body and the flashlight Boever had been carrying — still illuminated the next morning — as he looked around the scene the night of the crash. Ravnsborg said neither he nor the county sheriff who came to the scene knew that Boever’s body was lying just feet from the pavement on the highway shoulder. “There isn’t any way you can go by without seeing that,” Arnie Rummel, an agent with the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation who led the criminal probe, said in testimony Tuesday. Rummel added that Ravnsborg had hardly behaved like someone who had hit a deer — a common occurrence on the highways of South Dakota. Prosecutors also raised an exchange that Ravnsborg had with one of his staff members three days following the crash, after he had submitted his phones to crash investigators. Ravnsborg questioned an agent in the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation about what would turn up during forensic exams of his cellphones, even though the agency was supposed to have no part in the investigation to avoid conflicts of interest. “We were not supposed to be involved,” the now-retired agent, Brent Gromer, said as he described why the exchange made him uncomfortable. Ravnsborg’s defense attorney contended that the attorney general had done nothing nefarious and instead had cooperated fully with the crash investigation. His defense attorney, Mike Butler, described any discrepancies in Ravnsborg’s memory of that night as owing to human error. Butler disparaged the testimony from Rummel, the crash investigator, as “opinion” that would not hold up in a court of law. Ravnsborg was willing to take a polygraph test, though criminal investigators determined that it would not have been effective to test the attorney general’s truthfulness. The GOP-controlled Senate, which has 32 Republican members and three Democrats, will hear from impeachment prosecutors, defense attorneys, crash investigators and former members of Ravnsborg’s staff. It will take 24 senators, or two-thirds of the body’s 35 members, to convict Ravnsborg on either of two articles of impeachment: committing a crime that caused death, and malfeasance. The latter alleges that he misled investigators and abused the power of his office. Investigators said Ravnsborg asked a state Division of Criminal Investigation agent about what crash investigators could find on his cellphone. He has said he was simply seeking factual information. Noem called for Ravnsborg to resign soon after the crash and later pressed lawmakers to pursue impeachment. Noem also publicly endorsed Ravnsborg’s predecessor, Republican Marty Jackley, for election as his replacement. If Ravnsborg is forced out, the governor will appoint an interim to fill the post until the new attorney general elected in November is sworn in. Ravnsborg has argued that the governor, who has positioned herself for a possible 2024 White House bid, pushed for his removal in part because he had investigated ethics complaints against Noem. Ravnsborg in September agreed to an undisclosed settlement with Boever’s widow. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Arizona Official Emotionally Testifies About Standing Up To Trump,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Russell “Rusty” Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, repeatedly paused in an apparent effort to compose himself during his testimony Tuesday, as he described the consequences of refusing to violate his oath of office by declaring Donald Trump the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Trump and his lawyers were central to the intense pressure campaign on Bowers once it had become apparent that Joe Biden had won several key states, including Arizona. In the last weeks of his presidency, Trump leaned on a number of state officials, trying to convince them to state publicly that election fraud had invalidated Biden’s win, but they refused. Bowers was among them, as he testified at the fourth public hearing held by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. He said his belief in the Constitution, which he called “divinely inspired,” is “a tenet” of his faith. “And so for me to do that, because somebody just asked me to, is foreign to my very being,” Bowers said. “I will not do it.” Bowers gets emotional when discussing efforts to overturn the election: ""It is a tenet of my faith that the constitution divinely inspire my most basic foundational beliefs. And so for me to do that because somebody just asked me to is foreign to my very being. I will not do it."" pic.twitter.com/NKGKvgKALJ Trump’s team argued many times in court that various forms of election fraud had taken place in 2020. The courts, however, repeatedly ruled against him, determining there was no such evidence. Bowers described conversations with Trump’s team where he asked if he could see the evidence that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed to have. Giuliani said he would produce it, but he never did, Bowers testified. The Arizona lawmaker also pushed back on an effort by Trump’s allies to convince him to hold a vote to decertify the state’s slate of electors, in order for a pro-Trump slate of electors to take their place. Bowers said that John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump, told him: “Just do it and let the courts sort it out.” Bowers recounted his response: “You’re asking me to do something that’s never been done in the history of the United States.” At another point, Bowers read a short excerpt from his personal journal that was written in late 2020, at the request of committee member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). “I do not want to be a winner by cheating. I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to,” Bowers read. He explained how his office received more than 20,000 emails and “tens of thousands” of voicemails and texts from Trump supporters at the time. The “circus,” as he referred to the election aftermath, even showed up on his doorstep. Bowers testified that Trump supporters came to his home, upsetting his chronically ill daughter. (She died several weeks later.) “At home ... it is the new pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays, because we have various groups come by,” Bowers testified. “They have had video panel trucks with video of me, proclaiming me to be a pedophile and a pervert, a corrupt politician.” “So it was disturbing,” he said. “It was disturbing.” Shortly before the hearing began, Trump released a statement disparaging Bowers, calling him “the latest [Republican in name only] to play along with the Unselect Committee” ― his nickname for the House panel. Trump claimed that Bowers told him in November 2020 that the election “was rigged” and that Trump had “won Arizona.” He concluded with an apparent threat: “Bowers should hope there’s not a tape of the conversation.” Under oath, Bowers hit back. He said that while he did have a conversation with the president, “that certainly isn’t it.” “Anywhere, anyone, any time has said that I said that the election was rigged, that would not be true,” Bowers testified. The House committee investigating the Capitol attack is expected to hold another hearing Thursday as it continues its inquiry.

3,What Does Success Look Like For The Jan. 6 Committee?,politics," Reporter, HuffPost With the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol more than halfway through its seven public hearings, the big question now looming over the proceedings is whether or not they will be a success — and what success will look like. The comparison most readily made when discussing successful congressional committee hearings is that of the Senate Watergate Committee. The investigation into Richard Nixon’s successful efforts to abuse the executive branch to help his reelection campaign carried on the three major television stations and helped turn public opinion against Nixon. Across the country, Americans watched together as former White House counsel John Dean revealed the existence of the Oval Office taping system. And again saw corroborating testimony by Alexander Butterfield, the former White House aide who installed the system. The “smoking gun” tapes ultimately proved Nixon’s illegal machinations and led to his resignation ahead of imminent impeachment. But the Jan. 6 committee is not investigating a sitting president; former President Donald Trump left office on Jan. 20, 2021. The hearings also are not a precursor to an impeachment proceeding, since the House already impeached Trump weeks after the insurrection for directing the attack on the Capitol and attempting to steal the 2020 election. So, what does success look like exactly? The committee’s success should be judged within “four boxes,” Norm Eisen, a former counsel on the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment of Trump and White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost. Those four boxes are: “the cable box,” “the legislative tally box,” “the ballot box” and “the jury box.” The “cable box” corresponds with the committee’s ability to affect public opinion in telling the story of Trump’s plot to steal the election before and on Jan. 6 and the ongoing plot to steal the next election. The “legislative tally box” would be filled with any legislation enacted in response to the committee’s findings to prevent future election theft attempts. The “ballot box” judges whether the committee’s findings can create a bipartisan referendum against those who sought to steal the 2020 election in November or in 2024. And the “jury box” will judge whether the committee’s work feeds into ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice and the Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney’s Office. What people remember about the Watergate hearings is that the revelations that ultimately led to the disclosure of the “smoking gun” tape had a sizable impact on public opinion. The case of Jan. 6 is a little bit more complicated, in that, the effort to overturn the election was largely done in plain sight. What the Jan. 6 committee needs to do is not necessarily find a “smoking gun,” but establish a shared understanding of what happened that day and in the lead up to it and the danger it posed to the continuation of American democracy. “One critical way of conceiving success for the committee’s work might be the degree to which they are able to help generate a more shared, complete, truthful understanding among the public about the conspiracy to overturn the election,” Grant Tudor, policy advocate at the nonprofit Protect Democracy, said. This may not only be the hardest thing to accomplish, but also, as Tudor says, “the fuzziest and squishiest and the least easy to assess” of the measures of success for the committee’s work. The challenge for the committee is that American politics are at a high point of partisan polarization, a quite different dynamic than faced by the Watergate committee in the 1970s when partisan polarization, particularly in Congress, was at a low point. This is particularly true for the Republican Party. Polls consistently show that most Republicans believe Trump’s lies about election fraud, with around 50% of Republicans see the attack on the Capitol in positive terms like the act of “patriotism” or “defending freedom.” Despite this, there still remains a “a persuadable part of the electorate,” according to Tudor. Polls have shown that around one-fifth of respondents were unsure about some of the basic facts surrounding the Jan. 6 attack, including that it was part of a broader conspiracy to overturn the election. “That shared understanding doesn’t need to be unanimous,” said Daniel Weiner, director of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, a liberal law and policy nonprofit. “It needs to be a shared understanding of a governing majority.” The key then is to establish the connection between Trump’s effort to abuse the rules around the counting of Electoral College votes within Congress in order to steal the election and the insurrectionary violence he directed at the Capitol at the very moment lawmakers were counting those votes. The committee is attempting to do this almost exclusively through the testimony of Republicans who served in Trump’s administration or who advised key players from outside and evidence collected from those around Trump who sought to overturn the election results. “I’ve been impressed so far at the step-by-step exposure of what happened on January 6 and leading up to it ― for the most part, from the testimony of Trump administration insiders acknowledging that it was dangerous and criminal,” Joanne Freeman, a historian at Yale University whose latest book “The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War” examined political violence in Congress in the mid-19th century, said in an email. The hearings have so far shown Trump administration veterans revealing that Trump and his inner circle were repeatedly told that their scheme to steal the election was illegal and that some, including conservative lawyer John Eastman, even conceded that fact at the time. The timeline the committee has presented also links the effort to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to not count certain states’ Electoral College votes to the “wild” protests that eventually resulted in the breach of the Capitol. But just as important as presenting a timeline linking the Electoral College plot to the riot on Jan. 6 is to show that the threat has not passed. “The insurrection has not ended,” Eisen said. “The ‘Big Lie’ is still burning across the country.” To that end, former judge Michael Luttig, a conservative luminary who was once shortlisted for a Supreme Court seat, clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and served as a mentor to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), plainly stated in testimony given on Jun. 16 that, “Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy.” “To this very day, the former president and his allies and supporters pledge that if the former president or his anointed successor as the Republican Party presidential candidate were to lose [in 2024], that they would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election, but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020,” Luttig said. Luttig’s comments naturally flow into the next measure of success for the committee, and that is whether or not legislation is passed based on its findings. This “is the most important” metric of success, Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA School of Law, told HuffPost. “[T]here’s no reason to think that the danger of stolen elections has passed, and next time those who attempt it might not be bunglers like Trump and his co-conspirators,” Hasen said. To prevent a repeat of the Jan. 6 plot, Congress would, at the very least, need to reform the Electoral Count Act, which governs how Congress counts Electoral College votes, to make clear that states cannot submit competing slates of electors to Congress that are not based on the popular vote totals of their elections, clarify that the vice president must open and count only valid Electoral College votes and raise the threshold for lawmakers challenging a state’s Electoral College votes, among other things. A bipartisan group of senators has been working on such legislation since January and such reforms have received endorsement from the conservative Wall Street Journal Editorial Board. But, so far, no details on the legislation have been released. Tim Roemer, former Democratic congressman from Indiana and member of the 9/11 Commission, in calling for Electoral Count Act reform, said that the committee must not just put forward policy recommendations, but also continue to push for them after its public work is done. “Follow up on your recommendations,” Roemer said. “And tenaciously and determinedly make sure they’re passed into law. Your work’s not done when you make the recommendations. You’ve got to see them implemented into law.” At the first meeting of the 9/11 Commission, the five Democrats and five Republicans discussed how they would work alongside the 9/11 families to enact any recommendations they ultimately came up with. Whatever policy recommendations the committee does ultimately make, if it makes any, should be unanimous, like the 9/11 Commission’s were, Roemer said. “Most blue ribbon commissions, their recommendations end up in some warehouse in some nondescript building in Maryland buried under a lot of extraneous bureaucratic paperwork,” Roemer said. “They need to make sure this one stands out.” Tudor, however, worries that putting the onus on the committee to pass legislation based on its recommendations “risks creating an unreasonably high expectation for the committee,” particularly since Congress “as it’s currently designed, [makes it] difficult if not impossible to pass meaningful reforms, especially at the scale that would probably be required to meaningfully guard against this type of thing happening again.” “The committee needs to, without ever doing over partisan electioneering, make clear that November is a bipartisan referendum,” Eisen said. “Are we going to have democracy in our country or Trumpery?” Eisen was the lone voice among those HuffPost talked to to list electoral outcomes as a measure of success for the committee. Others were explicit in stating the opposite. “I do not think the hearings should be measured by whether Democrats keep control of Congress,” Weiner said. But electoral outcomes are a fair measure of success. The reason for this circles back to what the retired conservative judge Luttig said on Thursday. Trump and many in the Republican Party intend on running the exact same playbook to steal the election in 2024 if they do not win an Electoral College majority. In fact, numerous crucial elections for positions that will have power over the certification of elections in key swing states feature Republican candidates who are expressly running on a platform of not certifying election wins by Democrats. Some of these GOP candidates, like Doug Mastriano, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, and Ryan Kelly, the poll leader for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Michigan, were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Kelly was indicted and arrested on Jun. 9 for entering the Capitol grounds, which he saw as a boon for his campaign. This measure of success connects to the committee’s success at affecting public opinion. The party of the incumbent president almost always loses congressional seats in a midterm election. The number of seats are usually tied to the incumbent’s approval ratings, which, in turn, are tied to economic concerns like the Gross Domestic Product growth rate and gas prices. And there are no shortage of economic concerns for voters, from inflation to supply chain shortages to a possible Federal Reserve induced recession. Most polls show economic concerns the top issue for Americans in 2022. “If we lose this democracy,” Roemer said, explaining the argument that needs to be made to the public. “If the precedent becomes, you lose an election you can assault the government or take power in your own hands, that’s the end of our great experiment that our founder started 250 years ago. And we don’t get answers or solutions, whether it’s from the government or the private sector, for these other issues we care so much about.” Finally, the committee’s investigation could feed into investigations already under way in the Department of Justice and in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ office. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said that the committee would not be making a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. Other committee members, including Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), pushed back on that suggestion by saying the committee had not decided on that yet. Whether or not the committee makes an official referral to the Justice Department, it has been fairly explicit in outlining how Trump’s actions and those of his inner circle were illegal — and that they knew it was illegal. This outline, presented at the committee’s first public hearing by Cheney, details how Trump pressured party, state and federal officials to corruptly help him overturn the election results. As he did this, his own Department of Justice and lawyers both opposed and in support of his plot to overturn the election told him that what he was doing was illegal. He then rallied a mob of supporters on the Mall and directed them at the Capitol. When the mob breached the Capitol, he did not lift a finger to stop them. The committee has backed up this outline of criminality with evidence from key players and testimony exclusively from Republicans who served in the Trump administration or Republicans who played some role around the events of Jan. 6. “The type of fact finding that this body is doing is quite literally, in real time, collecting precious evidence and collating that evidence and systematizing that evidence in a way that will very likely be helpful for criminal prosecutions and investigations,” Tudor said. And it does appear that the Department of Justice wants the evidence the committee has collected. In a Jun. 15 letter to the committee, the department complained that the committee has not shared witness testimony to aid in its criminal investigations and prosecutions, specifically the prosecution of leaders of the Proud Boys, a pro-Trump street fighting group. The Justice Department is not the only legal entity investigating Trump’s potential illegal activity related to Jan. 6. Fulton County DA Willis has empaneled a grand jury investigating Trump’s effort to pressure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to flip the state’s election results. Raffensperger is slated to testify publicly before the committee on Jun. 21. Even aside from these four areas, some experts who spoke with HuffPost said the committee is already a success simply through the work it has already done. “In holding hearings, the House is enacting the basic fact of accountability and upholding the idea and reality of the rule of law,” Freeman said over email. “At a time when faith in the national government is slipping, the hearings are also showing Congress in action as a functioning institution, holding itself accountable for its responsibilities as well. Regardless of the final outcome, this kind of public, visible accountability is vitally important.” This work creates a public record of the first time there was not a peaceful transfer of power since the outbreak of the Civil War. It provides officially gathered evidence that Jan. 6 was not simply the attack on the Capitol, but a broad, if also insanely stupid, conspiracy led by the sitting president to overthrow the elected government of the United States. “In practical terms, that kind of fact-finding lays the ground for truth-telling that might not break through tomorrow, but keeps open the door for truth-telling efforts in the future — perhaps a long time from now,” Tudor said. The success of the committee hangs over what “a long time from now” looks like. Will the U.S. survive a second attempt to steal an election in 2024? And will the country be recognizable if it doesn’t? Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

5,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said.

He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man.

The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

10,Sotomayor Voices 'Growing Concern' Over Conservative Supreme Court,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the court on Tuesday for continuing “to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build,” adding that she feels “growing concern for where this Court will lead us next.” The critique came as part of her dissenting opinion in the case of Carson v. Makin. The conservative majority’s ruling will allow government funds to go to religious schools in some instances — including those that bar LGBTQ students — over the objection of the state of Maine. “Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation,” Sotomayor wrote. In its 6-3 decision, the conservative-leaning court ruled that Maine is required to pay religious schools tuition aid in certain situations. Rural families in the state receive taxpayer funds to send their children to a public or private school of their choosing if they don’t live in an area with a public school. The state of Maine had argued that religious private schools should not be included in the program, citing the First Amendment among its reasons. But the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, said that excluding such schools from the public benefit violated protections for the free exercise of religion. “Nothing in the Constitution requires today’s result,” Sotomayor argued. She called the majority opinion “especially perverse” because the case involves public education. “As this Court has long recognized, the Establishment Clause requires that public education be secular and neutral as to religion,” Sotomayor wrote. In addition to being nonsecular, the two institutions involved in the case, Bangor Christian and Temple Academy, have implemented policies allowing them to deny LGBTQ students admission. That means, Sotomayor argued, that “while purporting to protect against discrimination of one kind, the Court requires Maine to fund what many of its citizens believe to be discrimination of other kinds.” Sotomayor went on to recall her own dissent in a related 2017 case that also chipped away at the barrier between church and state. “In just a few years, the Court has upended constitutional doctrine, shifting from a rule that permits States to decline to fund religious organizations to one that requires States in many circumstances to subsidize religious indoctrination with taxpayer dollars,” she wrote in Tuesday’s dissent. Her dissent followed one written by Justice Stephen Breyer, who said that he “fear[s]” the Supreme Court has now “effectively abandon[ed]” a “longstanding doctrine” that gave states leeway in deciding when to allow religious organizations access to taxpayers’ money. Both Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan signed on to Breyer’s dissent; Sotomayor made additional points in her own opinion. In the past, the Supreme Court has emphasized the line between church and state, ruling in 1948 that public schools cannot set aside time for weekly religious teachings. Later cases prohibited other religious activities, like readings from the Bible. The court has yet to rule on another church-and-state case pending this term, involving a former high school football coach who was fired for praying with the young players after their games. However, the court’s conservative majority appeared poised to side with the coach when the case was argued earlier this year.

11,GOP State Officials Testify About Trump’s Pressure Campaign To Steal 2020 Election,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Republican leader of the Arizona House of Representatives and a mother-daughter team of Georgia election workers told Congress on Tuesday about the death threats they received just for doing their jobs. “There is nowhere I feel safe ― nowhere,” Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman told the House Jan. 6 committee. “Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States to target you? The president of the United states is supposed to represent every American, not to target one.” Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, put human faces on Donald Trump’s effort to overthrow American democracy, with testimony about the living hell their lives became after Trump and his legal team falsely accused them of stuffing ballot boxes. High-ranking Republicans who stood up to Trump in 2020 suffered similar fates. Arizona House Speaker Russell “Rusty” Bowers said his office was so saturated with thousands of voicemails and emails from angry Trump supporters that “we were unable to work, or at least communicate” for days. Bowers said that even recently, his family worries what will happen on Saturdays. “We have various groups come by and they have had video panel trucks with video proclaiming me of being a pedophile, a corrupt politician,” Bowers said. “And blaring loudspeakers in my neighborhood, and leaving literature both on my property arguing and threatening with neighbors and with myself.” Tuesday’s hearing by the House Jan. 6 committee portrayed the threats as part of a deliberate strategy by Trump to steal the election, a strategy that predictably resulted in the riot at the Capitol as Congress certified the final result. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a committee member and former federal prosecutor, said in his opening statement that when officials resisted Trump’s entreaties to stop counting ballots or to certify him as the winner even though he’d lost, the pressure only mounted. “This pressure campaign brought angry phone calls and texts, armed protests, intimidation, and, all too often, threats of violence and death,” Schiff said. “State legislators were singled out. So, too, were statewide elections officials. Even local elections workers, diligently doing their jobs, were accused of being criminals, and had their lives turned upside down.” In video depositions played during Tuesday’s hearing, Republican state lawmakers described what happened when Trump targeted them in his effort to get state legislatures to undo the results of the election in their states. Michigan state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R) said he received more than 4,000 text messages after Trump shared his phone number on Facebook. “All my personal information was doxxed online,” Pennsylvania state House Speaker Bryan Cutler (R) said. The bipartisan committee has been investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot for nearly a year. In a series of hearings that started earlier this month, the committee has portrayed the attack on the Capitol as the culmination of a Trump-led conspiracy that his own advisers told him had no legal justification. Last week, the committee detailed Trump’s pressure campaign against his own vice president, Mike Pence. Trump spurred on the mob in an effort to intimidate Pence into throwing out Joe Biden’s election victory; the hearing revealed that a federal law enforcement source believed an extremist group involved in the riot “would have killed Mike Pence if given the chance.” Tuesday’s hearing showcases Trump’s earlier efforts to overturn election results in Arizona and, more famously, in Georgia. The featured witnesses included Bowers and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans. Bowers came under intense pressure from Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to overturn Trump’s loss in Arizona. He survived targeted harassment and threats from Trump’s followers, as well as a recall attempt. In January 2022, he blocked a GOP bill that would have let the legislature overturn election results. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library honored him recently with a Profile in Courage Award. Bowers said Giuliani and Trump campaign attorney John Eastman pressured him repeatedly to call the state House into session to undo the election. He said he told Eastman that doing so would be contrary to the oath to the Constitution he’d taken as a lawmaker. “He said, ‘Just do it and let the courts sort it out,’” Bowers said. “You’re asking me to do something that’s never been done in the history of the United States.” Bowers also revealed that U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) called him on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021. “He asked if I would sign on both to a letter that had been sent from my state and that I would support the decertification of the electors and I said that I would not,” Bowers said. Raffensperger and Georgia chief elections officer Gabriel Sterling testified about Trump’s efforts to coerce them into overturning his loss in their state. Both have already testified before a grand jury in Atlanta’s Fulton County, where prosecutors are investigating Trump and his inner circle based on his phone call to Raffensperger that the secretary of state recorded and that was later released to The Washington Post. Raffensperger has said Trump threatened him on that phone call, and he described the results of the threat on Tuesday. “After the election, my cellphone and email was doxxed. Eventually, my wife started getting texts,” Raffensperger said. “They started going after her, I think just to probably put pressure on me.” Raffensperger also mentioned that someone broke into his widowed daughter-in-law’s home; Reuters reported last year that the Raffensperger family went into hiding for nearly a week as a result of the break-in. Trump also tried to end Raffensperger’s political career by recruiting Georgia Republican Congressman Jody Hice to run against him in last month’s primary, but Raffensperger managed to win with a clear majority anyway, thereby avoiding a runoff, and is now almost certain to win a second term in November. The second part of Tuesday’s hearing featured Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, a former Fulton County election worker whom Trump followers inundated with harassment, including threats of lynching, after conspiracy theorists falsely claimed she and her mother, also an election worker, had engaged in voter fraud to hurt Trump in Georgia. She also received a Profile in Courage Award for her work. “I don’t want anyone knowing my name,” Moss told the committee. “I don’t go to the grocery store at all. I haven’t been anywhere at all. I gained about 60 pounds. I just don’t do anything anymore. I don’t want to go anywhere.” Freeman, Moss’s mother, attended the hearing but did not testify in person. Instead, the committee played a video of her remarks during an earlier deposition with committee aides. She said the FBI told her to hide from Jan. 6 until after the inauguration, and that she hid for two months. “I won’t even introduce myself by my name anymore,” Freeman said. “I get nervous when I bump into someone I know in the grocery store who says my name ― I am worried about who is listening. I get nervous when I have to give my name for food orders. I am always concerned of who is around me. I have lost my name and I have lost my reputation. I have lost my sense of security. All because a group of people, starting with Number 45 and his ally, Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me ― to push their own lies about how the presidential election was stolen.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Woman Who Issued First Same-Sex Marriage License In 1975 Dies,politics," BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Clela Rorex, a former Colorado county clerk considered a pioneer in the gay rights movement for being the first public official to issue a same-sex marriage license in 1975, has died. She was 78. Rorex died Sunday of complications from recent surgery at a hospice care facility in Longmont, the Daily Camera reported. Rorex was a newly elected Boulder County clerk when a gay couple denied a marriage license elsewhere sought her help in March 1975. She told The Associated Press in 2014 that she saw a parallel with the women’s movement and found nothing in state law preventing it. The then-31-year-old agreed and, in the end, issued a total of six licenses to gay couples before Colorado’s attorney general at the time ordered her to stop. State and federal law didn’t recognize gay marriage at the time. Rorex recalled that she had little public support and didn’t challenge the attorney general. A recall effort was launched against Rorex, a single mother and University of Colorado graduate student. Suffering from chronic migraines and dealing with hate mail, she resigned halfway through her term. Colorado legalized gay marriage in 2014 after a state court and a Denver federal court struck down a 2006 ban enacted by state voters. A 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision recognized the fundamental right nationwide. Jared Polis, Colorado’s first openly gay governor, paid tribute to Rorex upon learning of her passing. “Her certification of same-sex marriages (until the Attorney General shut her down) was a pivotal moment in the long struggle for marriage equality that led to Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which legalized marriage equality nationally,” Polis wrote on Facebook. “So many families, including First Gentleman Marlon Reis and I, are grateful for the visionary leadership of Clela Rorex, a woman ahead of her time.” Glenda Russell, a retired writer and LGTBQ community historian, told the Camera that Rorex faced significant backlash after issuing the first license. “Nationally at the time, most people didn’t take it too seriously because they didn’t worry about it happening again, but in Boulder, the reaction was forceful and mean spirited. She got hit with all the homophobia and heterosexism that the LGBTQ community was facing,” Russell said. In later years, Rorex advocated for gay and lesbian rights, speaking in schools and expressing exasperation with the slow pace of change. According to Out Boulder County, an LGTBQ advocacy organization, Rorex was born in Denver on July 23, 1943. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Colorado before running for county clerk and recorder. After resigning as clerk in 1977 she obtained post-graduate degrees and served a legal administrator for the Native American Rights Fund. A celebration of life was planned for July 23, Out Boulder County said. The county courthouse in Boulder where she issued the licenses has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

13,Ginni Thomas-Linked Group Spread Election Lies At Event 2 Months After Jan. 6 Riot,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Ginni Thomas, the wife of conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, reportedly attended a meeting of a group involved in spreading election lies two months after a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Thomas attended a group meeting headlined by pastor and conservative radio host C.L. Bryant on March 6, 2021, in which Bryant openly questioned President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win, according to a video recording of the event reviewed by The Washington Post. “There is a robbery that is going on in this country right now,” Bryant said at the Frontliners for Liberty event. “In fact, I say it to you and I’ll say it loud and clear, and I’m not ashamed to say it. I won’t bite my tongue. I do believe that Donald John Trump is the only legitimate president.” The Post also said a photo from that meeting shows Thomas posing with Bryant. In December 2020, Thomas invited John Eastman, a lawyer advising former President Donald Trump on his efforts to overturn the election, to speak before the same group to provide “an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically,” Eastman wrote on his Substack, attaching a copy of the email Thomas sent to him. The Post spoke to members of Frontliners for Liberty who described the group as a “loose-knit coalition of conservative activists” that is confidential. Last week, the Post reported the House panel was in possession of emails exchanged between the two, citing sources saying the correspondence was evidence that Thomas was more involved than previously known in interfering with the election results. This prompted the committee to send an invitation to Thomas to testify, Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told reporters Thursday. The email Eastman published appears to be part of the 170 documents a California judge ordered the lawyer to turn over to the committee, including 10 documents that the judge wrote were related to three meetings held in December 2020 by a group supporting Trump, according to NBC News. “Four documents pertain to a meeting on Dec. 8, 2020: two emails are the group’s high-profile leader inviting Dr. Eastman to speak at the meeting, and two contain the meeting’s agenda,” U.S. District Judge David Carter said. Carter ruled the House panel “has a substantial interest in these three meetings because the presentations furthered a critical objective of the January 6 plan: to have contested states certify alternate slates of electors for President Trump.” The communications between Thomas and Eastman also point out a direct conflict of interest for her husband, who did not recuse himself from cases related to the Capitol riot. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissent in a case before the court involving claims of executive privilege by Trump and some of his officials about documents requested by the Jan. 6 committee. Among those officials was Mark Meadows, with whom Ginni Thomas exchanged text messages urging him to continue fighting the election result. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) on Thursday called on Clarence Thomas to resign following reports on his wife’s conduct. “And while she was doing all this, her husband, Justice Clarence Thomas, was hearing litigation relating to the 2020 election,” Pascrell wrote, calling Thomas “a corrupt jurist who has poisoned the High Court.” Eastman, who clerked for Clarence Thomas, strongly denies having any conversations with Ginni Thomas about Supreme Court cases. “I can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,” Eastman wrote on his Substack. “We have never engaged in such discussions, would not engage in such discussions, and did not do so in December 2020 or anytime else.” In an interview with Washington Free Beacon in March, Ginni Thomas said she does not interfere with her husband’s work on the court. “Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me, and I don’t involve him in my work,” she said. Eastman was also the subject of the committee’s third public hearing, which showed he was involved in crafting a fake electors scheme that would block Biden’s win, even though he knew it was illegal.

14,Supreme Court Rules Religious Schools Can Get Maine Tuition Aid,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Maine can’t exclude religious schools from a program that offers tuition aid for private education, a decision that could ease religious organizations’ access to taxpayer money. The 6-3 outcome could fuel a renewed push for school choice programs in some of the 18 states that have so far not directed taxpayer money to private, religious education. The most immediate effect of the court’s ruling beyond Maine probably will be felt next door in Vermont, which has a similar program. The decision is the latest in a line of rulings from the Supreme Court that have favored religion-based discrimination claims. The court is separately weighing the case of a football coach who says he has a First Amendment right to pray at midfield immediately after games. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority that the Maine program violates the Constitution’s protections for religious freedoms. “Maine’s ‘nonsectarian’ requirement for its otherwise generally available tuition assistance payments violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Regardless of how the benefit and restriction are described, the program operates to identify and exclude otherwise eligible schools on the basis of their religious exercise,” Roberts wrote. The court’s three liberal justices dissented. “This Court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. Justice Stephen Breyer noted in a separate dissent that Maine “wishes to provide children within the State with a secular, public education. This wish embodies, in significant part, the constitutional need to avoid spending public money to support what is essentially the teaching and practice of religion.” But Roberts wrote that states are not obligated to subsidize private education. Once they do, however, they can’t cut out religious schools, he wrote, echoing his opinion in a similar case from two years ago. “Maine chose to allow some parents to direct state tuition payments to private schools; that decision was not ‘forced upon’ it,” Roberts wrote, quoting from Sotomayor’s dissent. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said during a Tuesday radio appearance that he was not surprised by the court’s decision, but he felt it was not consistent with his reading of the Constitution. Frey also said the court’s ruling will require a reevaluation of how it applies to state law. Until now, Maine’s exclusion of religious schools has been upheld, Frey said during the appearance on Maine Public. “Frankly, it is concerning, even though we saw it coming.” The ideological split in Tuesday’s decision also was evident during arguments in December, when the conservative justices seemed largely unpersuaded by Maine’s position that the state is willing to pay for the rough equivalent of a public education, but not religious inculcation. In largely rural Maine, the state allows families who live in towns that don’t have public schools to receive public tuition dollars to send their children to the public or private school of their choosing. The program has excluded religious schools. Students who live in a district with public schools or in a district that contracts with another public system are ineligible for the tuition program. Parents who challenged the program argued that the exclusion of religious schools violates their religious rights under the Constitution. Teacher unions and school boards said states can impose limits on public money for private education without running afoul of religious freedoms. Michael Bindas, a lawyer for the libertarian Institute for Justice who argued for the parents at the high court, said the court made clear Tuesday that “there is no basis for this notion that the government is able to single out and exclude religious options.” Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, sharply criticized the court for “forcing taxpayers to fund religious education” and cloaking “this assault on our Constitution in the language of non-discrimination.” In the Maine case, parents sued in federal court to be able to use state aid to send their children to Christian schools in Bangor and Waterville. The schools in question, Bangor Christian School and Temple Academy, are uncertain whether they would accept public funds, according to court filings. The Bangor school said it would not hire teachers or admit students who are transgender. Both schools said they do not hire gay or lesbian teachers, according to court records. In 2020, the high court ruled 5-4 that states must give religious schools the same access to public funding that other private schools receive, preserving a Montana scholarship program that had largely benefited students at religious institutions. In that case, the court said states don’t have to allow public money to be used in private education. But they can’t keep religious schools out of such programs, once created. But even after that ruling, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Maine program, holding that the state was not violating anyone’s constitutional rights by refusing to allow taxpayer money to be used for religious instruction. The three-judge panel included retired Justice David Souter, who occasionally hears cases in the appeals court. Most of the justices attended religious schools, and several send or have sent their children to them. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Mike Pence Calls Jan. 6 'A Tragic Day' But Defends Trump Record,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Former Vice President Mike Pence, who congressional investigators said was 40 feet from a pro-Trump lynch mob during the Capitol riot, said Monday he will not allow Democrats to use the insurrection to distract from their “failed agenda.” Pence, the focus of the third public hearing of the House committee investigating the 2021 riot, recognized Jan. 6 as a “tragic day,” but defended the record of former President Donald Trump’s administration. “January 6 was a tragic day, and I know we did our duty, but I will always be proud of our record,” Pence said in an interview with Fox News Digital following his speech on the economy at the University Club of Chicago. “And I am not going to allow the Democrats to use that tragic day to distract attention from their failed agenda or to demean the intentions of 74 million Americans who rallied behind our cause.” Pence said he was concerned over what he called “voting irregularities” in the 2020 election, but stopped well short of embracing Trump’s lies about vote fraud. “I had hoped that the courts — including the Supreme Court — would have taken up and considered the fact that a number of states had changed rules governing elections,” Pence said. “But, ultimately, the courts passed on them, and the Electoral College certified the outcome, and I knew that my oath was clear.” The House panel on Thursday revealed the pro-Trump mob was 40 feet from the vice president and his family at one point on Jan. 6. Some rioters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” after a Trump tweet calling out Pence for refusing to block President Joe Biden’s win. The hearing also revealed members of the Proud Boys extremist group “would have killed Mike Pence if given the chance,” a committee member said. Despite the harrowing experience, Pence told Fox News Digital he and Trump “were very close friends,” and ended their term in office “amicably.” “I don’t know if the president and I will ever see eye to eye on my duties on Jan. 6, but, in the aftermath of that tragic day, we sat down, and we talked through it,” Pence said. Asked if he is considering a presidential run in 2024, Pence did not rule it out, but said his priority is for the GOP to win this year’s midterm elections. “Karen and I will do what we’ve always done — we’ll take time to pray about it, we’ll seek counsel of trusted friends and advisers, and we’ll go where we’re called,” Pence said. “One thing I’ll tell you is that I won’t let anybody else make that decision for me,” Pence added. Members of the House committee have signaled that they may subpoena Pence to testify. “Certainly a possibility,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “We’re not excluding anyone or anything at this point.” On Tuesday, the committee will hear from state officials, including Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to discuss the pressure they were under to block Biden’s win.

16,"Ahead Of Supreme Court Decision, Democrats Mount Billboards Hitting GOP On Abortion Rights",politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost As Washington braces for what is expected to be a U.S. Supreme Court decision sharply restricting women’s reproductive rights, House Democrats are trying to put the issue front and center on the campaign trail. Their weapon of choice? Roadside billboards meant to remind motorists of individual Republican candidates’ stances on abortion. “Republicans have made their extremist crusade against abortion crystal clear and to their own dismay an overwhelming majority of Americans strongly disagree with them,” said Helen Kalla, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats. The timing is auspicious in that the Supreme Court is expected almost any day to formally hand down the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a draft of which was obtained by Politico weeks ago. The decision as drafted would largely gut the legal basis for abortion, leading to it being heavily restricted or completely banned in about half the states. While Republicans for decades campaigned on rolling back the almost 50-year-old Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973, they’ve taken a much quieter tack since the draft’s release showed them on the verge of a major victory. Capitol Hill Republicans preferred to shift the conversation away from the implications of the decision soon after the leak. Donald Trump, a two-time divorcé who courted evangelical support by successfully promising to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices, notably did not tout the win in his recent speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition. The DCCC ad campaign, described as a “five-figure buy” for nine billboards, will target 13 Republican candidates in North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and California. “Unfortunately for these swing-district GOP candidates, we will be relentlessly reminding voters of Republicans’ out-of-touch views until November,” Kalla said. The Republican candidates targeted by the campaign include Bo Hines in North Carolina; Mark Robertson, Sam Peters and April Becker in Nevada; Madison Gesiotto Gilbert and Rep. Steve Chabot in Ohio; Alek Skarlatos, Lori Chavez-Deremer and Mike Erickson in Oregon; and Lisa Scheller and Jeremy Shaffer in Pennsylvania; and Rep. Mike Garcia in California. And though not in a competitive district, the other Republican targeted is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.). While other billboard mock-ups seen by HuffPost include faces of the candidates and verbiage accusing Republicans of wanting to “ban abortion” or “roll back women’s rights,” McCarthy’s says if Republicans win, “reproductive freedom is over” and includes a picture of McCarthy with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), a Republican Party firebrand who was removed from serving on House committees. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Biden Names Mohegan Tribe Member To Be First Native American U.S. Treasurer,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Move over, Andrew Jackson — you’re going to have to share the face of the $20 bill with a Native American woman soon. The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that President Biden had picked Lynn Malerba, lifetime chief of the Connecticut-based Mohegan Tribe, to be the next U.S. Treasurer. The position oversees the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the U.S. Bullion Depository, better known as Ft. Knox. The Treasurer’s office dates back to the Continental Congress before the Treasury Department itself was created and one of its perks is having the Treasurer’s signature appear on the front faces of U.S. currency bills, an honor shared with the Treasury Secretary. That means once she’s settled, Malerba, whose ceremonial title as lifetime chief was bestowed upon her by the tribe’s Council of Elders, will have her name on the $20 bill, next to the portrait of Andrew Jackson. Jackson is the president responsible for the removal of several tribes from the Southeastern U.S. and is blamed for the consequent Trail of Tears. Treasury said Malerba will be the first tribal leader and first Native woman to ever sign the nation’s currency. In addition to her responsibilities with the Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Malerba will also head up a new Office of Tribal and Native Affairs meant to be a hub for Treasury policy affecting tribes. “This is an historic appointment,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who announced the appointment as part of a trip to the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. “Her leadership and experience will deepen our commitment to help expand economic opportunities for all Tribal communities.” Prior to being the first woman named lifetime chief, in 2010, Malerba was chairwoman of the Tribal Council, the tribe’s CEO post, and executive director of the tribe’s Health and Human Services department. She has also served on advisory councils for the Indian Health Service, the Justice Department and Treasury. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Biden 'Considering' Gas Tax Holiday To Lower Price At The Pump,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden said Monday he is considering unveiling a federal gas tax holiday that could cut the price of fuel  as Americans continue to struggle with dramatic levels of inflation. “I hope I have a decision based on the data. I’m looking for by the end of the week,” the president told reporters in Delaware, saying he was “considering” the proposal. Doing so would require action by Congress, and any cut to the gas tax would limit federal income used to pay for highways. The gas tax is currently 18.4 cents a gallon, and suspending it would help lower the price at the pump, which sat at $4.98 a gallon on average nationwide on Monday. Some states have prices far higher, notably California, where the average price for a gallon is $6.39, according to AAA. Those prices are slightly lower than the more than $5 per gallon average earlier this month, but are an uncomfortable increase for millions of Americans reckoning with surging rent and food prices. Biden ordered the release of millions of barrels of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve earlier this year, and the government increased the amount of ethanol blended into fuel to help stymie the record prices. But those actions have so far done little to rein in costs. Biden says he's considering a federal gas tax holiday that could save Americans as much as 18.4 cents per gallon, and he'll decide ""by the end of the week"" https://t.co/0mv1kNY1ZA pic.twitter.com/yTeHQQGMPV The White House has pointed to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine as a key driver of the runaway prices. But Biden has also lambasted oil companies for failing to help defray costs, noting such businesses have raked in billions in profits during the crisis. “I want an explanation for why they aren’t refining more oil,” Biden said Monday, just before members of his administration were set to meet with oil company CEOs later this week. It’s unclear how long a potential gas tax holiday could last, and some top Democrats have voiced opposition for one in the past. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said the issue isn’t off the table, but said it was merely “good PR” in April, adding there was “no guarantee that the reduction in the federal tax would be passed on to the consumer.” The White House sent letters to the country’s major oil companies last week, threatening to invoke emergency powers if they didn’t work to bring prices down for consumers. Fuel companies, however, appear unmoved. “At a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable,” the president wrote. “Your companies need to work with my Administration to bring forward concrete, near-term solutions that address the crisis.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said.

MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor.

Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Newt Gingrich's Kamala Harris Insult Barrage Might Be Beneath Even Him,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Far-right pot-stirrer Newt Gingrich mocked Vice President Kamala Harris’ qualifications to be president on Fox News Tuesday. (Watch the video below.) The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

10,Facebook Removes GOP Senate Candidate's 'RINO Hunting' Video,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook on Monday removed a campaign video by Republican Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Eric Greitens that shows him brandishing a shotgun and declaring that he’s hunting RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only. In the ad, Greitens, a former Missouri governor who resigned in disgrace in 2018, is flanked by a tactical unit outside a home on a tree-lined street as he whispers, “The RINO feeds on corruption and is marked by the stripes of cowardice,” using a term popularized by former President Donald Trump and his allies to deride moderate or establishment Republicans. The armed tactical team breaks through the front door and throws what appear to be flash-bang grenades inside. Greitens enters an empty living room through the smoke and says: “Join the MAGA crew. Get a RINO hunting permit. There’s no bagging limit, no tagging limit and it doesn’t expire until we save our country.” Facebook said the video was removed “for violating our policies prohibiting violence and incitement.” Twitter said Greitens’ post violated its rules about abusive behavior but said it was leaving it up because it was in the “public’s interest” for the tweet to be viewable. The company’s move prevented the post from being shared any further. The video comes at a time of renewed focus on violence in politics following fatal mass shootings and threats to government officials. Two weeks ago, a man carrying a gun, a knife and zip ties was arrested near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house after threatening to kill the justice. Around the same time, a gunman killed a retired county judge in Wisconsin before fatally shooting himself, and he had a list that included the names of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers. On Sunday, Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two Republicans serving on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, said he recently received a letter at his home threatening “to execute me, as well as my wife and 5-month-old child.” Greitens is among the Republican candidates in a highly competitive Aug. 2 primary to fill the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Roy Blunt. The provocative new ad appeared as Greitens looks to improve his standing in the polls, jolt lackluster fundraising and move past graphic allegations of domestic abuse made in a sworn affidavit filed by his ex-wife in March in their child custody case. Sheena Greitens has alleged that Eric Greitens was physically abusive to her and one of their sons, while demonstrating such “unstable and coercive behavior” that steps were taken to limit his access to firearms, court documents state. The former governor has vehemently denied the allegations, but they’ve dogged him on the campaign trail. He resigned in 2018 amid criminal investigations and after he was accused of having an extramarital affair with his hairdresser and taking a compromising photo of her to keep her from talking about it. Helen Wade, Sheena Greitens’ lawyer, told The Kansas City Star that she would “absolutely” use the new campaign video in the couple’s court case. “This is over the line,” Wade told the newspaper while indicating she would file court papers to make the video an exhibit in the case. Wade did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Republican Caleb Rowden, majority leader of the Missouri state Senate, tweeted: “We have been in contact with the Missouri Highway Patrol and hope that former Gov. Greitens finds the help he needs. Anyone with multiple accusations of abuse toward women and children should probably steer clear of this rhetoric.” Other candidates in the Senate race also condemned the video. We are sick and tired of the Republicans in Name Only surrendering to Joe Biden & the radical Left.Order your RINO Hunting Permit today! pic.twitter.com/XLMdJnAzSK Republican state Sen. Dave Schatz called it “completely irresponsible.” “That’s why I’m running. It’s time to restore sanity and reject this nonsense. Missouri deserves better,” Schatz said in a tweet. Democratic Senate candidate Lucas Kunce tweeted that “terrorists, child abusers, and criminals” like Greitens “shouldn’t even be able to get a weapon.” “Help me beat this guy in November, and I’ll keep our families safe from criminals like him,” Kunce said. The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, which has endorsed state Attorney General Eric Schmitt in the Republican Senate race, denounced Greitens’ video, saying it shows that Greitens “does not possess the sound judgment necessary” to represent the state and that “he has learned nothing from the legal problems” that preceded his resignation as governor. Greitens’ campaign dismissed the outrage that erupted over the new ad. “If anyone doesn’t get the metaphor, they are either lying or dumb,” campaign manager Dylan Johnson said in statement. The firestorm enveloping Greitens follows a well-worn playbook that has helped other Republican candidates juice their standing: Make an inflammatory statement or ad, wait for a backlash to develop, then cite the backlash while trying to raise money from grassroots donors online. In Greitens’ case, the actions taken by the social media giants could prove to be a further boon, tapping into resentment toward large technology companies that increasingly courses through the Republican Party. Once a swing state, Missouri has become more reliably Republican in recent years. But the Senate race is nonetheless receiving national attention because some in the GOP establishment are anxious that, if Greitens wins the primary, he would be vulnerable against a Democrat in November. With the Senate evenly divided, the GOP can’t afford to lose what would otherwise be a safe seat. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Trump Continues Push To Shut Down Voting Methods 69% of Americans Use,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump continues to push for single-day, in-person voting in elections — prohibiting mail-in ballots and early voting that 69% of American voters used in 2020. Despite the risk of slashing voter rolls by making casting a ballot far more difficult, Trump called last week at a Nashville convention for “same-day voting.” “Ultimately, we want same-day voting — one day — and only paper ballots,” Trump said to cheers. Trump has justified the GOP push for more difficult and restrictive voting by claiming it will protect against the kind of rigged election he insists occurred in 2020 — which has proven to be a lie. Ironically, Trump, who has baselessly claimed mail ballots are “corrupt,” votes by mail. “Ultimately, we want same day voting. One day!” pic.twitter.com/KiTUrxNArC Critics say Trump’s goal is to significantly decrease the number of votes, which is generally considered beneficial to Republicans. One user on Twitter quipped that Trump is running on a platform urging: “Don’t count all the votes.” Trump said on Fox News in 2020 that “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again” if “voting levels” were expanded. (Research has shown, however, that mail-in ballots don’t appear to give either party a distinct advantage.) Witnesses who testified at last week’s hearings before the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said that Trump wanted to shut down voting and not count anymore ballots while he was still ahead on election night. He tweeted the following morning: “Stop the count!” But that’s not the way elections work. Former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt testified about the “red mirage” when Republicans tend to be ahead in the evening of an election day before late and mail-in votes are counted, and catch up to, and often surpass, the early leaders. Trump, however, declared that night before all the votes were tallied: “Frankly, we did win this election.” Stepien in his deposition said Trump disagreed with his election night advice that he not declare victory. Trump then gave a speech where he said ""this is a fraud on the American public ... frankly we did win this election"" pic.twitter.com/s7eplwoOO1 The U.S. Census Department reported that in the 2020 election 69% of American voters nationwide cast their ballot “nontraditionally” — by mail and/or before Election Day. Early and mail-in voting have tremendously increased the convenience of casting a ballot, allowing and encouraging more people to vote. For example, homebound and bed-ridden citizens can now easily vote by mail. Early voting and mail-in ballots also aid people who work long hours or multiple jobs, or are juggling child care and are not able to get to polling spots before they close. Many employers don’t allow extra time to vote. Voters also no longer have to drive long distances to rural polling places on one particular day. Trump’s plan completely overlooks Americans abroad, including employees working overseas, service members and staff of diplomatic postings, who mail in their ballots. Critics on Twitter weren’t keen on Trump’s plot to make voting onerous. Nope. Ummmm lol ...""But only for the rich who can afford to take the day off to go vote, because we sure as hell aren't going to make Election Day a holiday."" In my experience as a pollworker? In person Election Day voting is overwhelmingly old white folks. So Trump doesn't want most of the military to vote? Interesting. Them or any other U.S. citizen living abroad, or those who cannot make the polls on one day. This is just such a messed up thought. Love to see that guy in line all day to cast his vote With no water 😂 The Republican Party leader is running on “don’t count all the votes”. Studied show that when fewer people vote, the Republicans have a better chance of winning.  That’s what this is about. ""Also we want to count my votes first so we know when to stop counting.

12,Trump Now Calls It 'Foolish' Not To Have More GOP On Jan. 6 Panel,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump now says it was “foolish” not to create a more bipartisan Jan. 6 House committee to investigate the insurrection. But it was his party, influenced by him, that stonewalled participation, apparently hoping the probe would die on the vine. “A bad decision was made,” Trump said in an interview with conservative radio host Wayne Allyn Root on his program, “Raw & Unfiltered.” It was a “bad decision not to have [Republican] representation on that committee,” he added. Trump emphasized: “That was a very, very foolish decision.” Now, he claims, the investigation is a “one-sided witch hunt.” The House select committee was formed last year after Senate Republicans voted to block creation of a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to probe the Capitol riot. Trump at the time called such a commission a “Democrat trap.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wasn’t negotiating in “good faith” on commission details. But Pelosi agreed that members be divided evenly between parties, and that unanimous agreement would be required before any subpoenas were issued. Democrats then sought to form a bipartisan House select committee. But Republicans stonewalled that, too, after Pelosi refused committee slots to two of five lawmakers recommended by McCarthy: Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana. Both men had voted to overturn the results of the presidential election based on lies that the vote was rigged, which Pelosi said would undermine the integrity of the panel. McCarthy then yanked all five of his recommendations and stopped cooperating to create a bipartisan panel. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) are currently the only Republicans participating with seven Democrats on the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. Now a string of Republicans from the Trump administration are testifying against their former boss about his role inciting the violent storming of the Capitol last year. According to a new ABC New/Ipsos poll, 60% of Americans surveyed believe the panel is conducting a “fair and impartial” investigation, and 58% believe that Trump should be charged for his role in the insurrection.

13,Critics Erupt Over Vicious Attack On LGBTQ Community By Texas GOP,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The Texas Republican Party is getting blasted for its shocking new platform declaring that “homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice.” The party’s updated mission statement, passed Saturday at its convention in Houston, also declares opposition to “all efforts to validate transgender identity” ― and calls for a ban on any gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy, for anyone under the age of 21. At the same time, it supports debunked and dangerous “conversion therapy” — which it now calls “Reintegrative Therapy” — to eliminate “same-sex attraction.” “These are just crazy people,” Michael Cargill told KXAN-TV in Austin, speaking about the Texas Republican Convention. Cargill — the acting chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which represents LGBTQ Republicans — lashed the party’s “hateful language” as “un-Christian.” The party banned the Log Cabin Republicans from having a booth at the convention this year. They “need to dig deep into the Bible, spend a little time in church on Sunday and listen to what the Lord says about loving all of his children,” Cargill said. Even Donald Trump Jr. suggested it was political suicide for the party to fight with other conservative Republicans, who may be LGBTQ, instead of going after Democrats and “RINOs,” shorthand for “Republicans in name only.” Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, attributed the hard-right turn by an already extremist party to Donald Trump. “Donald Trump radicalized the party and accelerated the demands from the base,” he told The Texas Tribune. “There simply aren’t limits now on what the base might ask for.” Twitter was flooded Monday with criticism of a party that cannot tolerate members of the LGBTQ community but can tolerate forcing a 12-year-old girl to have the baby of her rapist and accepts the murder of 19 children in Uvalde, Texas, as the cost of having firearms. Political commentator Lindy Li said the real thing that’s “abnormal” is Texas Republicans — as several other critics also noted.

14,Former GOP Missouri Gov. Blasted For 'RINO Hunting' Senate Campaign Ad,politics," Assignment editor, HuffPost Former Governor of Missouri and GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens released a campaign ad Monday morning that imagines Greitens and tactical gear-clad supporters bursting into a home and “hunting” political opponents. “I’m Eric Greitens, Navy SEAL,” the gun-toting candidate says in the 38-second ad posted on Twitter . “And today, we’re going RINO hunting.” We are sick and tired of the Republicans in Name Only surrendering to Joe Biden & the radical Left.Order your RINO Hunting Permit today! pic.twitter.com/XLMdJnAzSK The twisted pun refers to RINOs, an acronym that stands for “Republicans in Name Only,” who Greitens accused in his tweet of “surrendering to Joe Biden & the radical Left.” The ad then shows Greitens, along with several people wearing camouflage, standing on the porch of a suburban home wielding guns. “The RINO feeds on corruption and is marked by the stripes of cowardice,” Greitens says, before the group forces the door open and bursts into the home’s living room, guns drawn. The ad concludes with Greitens encouraging viewers to “join the MAGA crew” and “get a RINO hunting permit,” which “doesn’t expire until we save our country.” Hours after the ad went up, Twitter added a label stating that it “violated the Twitter Rules about abusive behavior,” but that the platform “determined it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.” Meanwhile, Meta opted to remove the ad from Facebook, a spokesperson told CNN. Numerous people criticized the ad’s disturbing implication and threatening imagery.

He resigned as governor amid the sexual assault allegations, along with accusations that he violated campaign finance law. And Greitens’ ex-wife, Sheena Greitens, has said he physically abused both her and their children. “Prior to our divorce, during an argument in late April 2018, Eric knocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children from our home,” she wrote in a court filing earlier this year.

15,Georgia's Brad Raffensperger To Testify At Next Public Jan. 6 Hearing,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot will hear from Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state; his deputy Gabriel Sterling; Rusty Bowers, Arizona’s House speaker; and former Georgia election worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss at the next public hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Tuesday’s hearing, which is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET, will focus on former President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign on officials in key states to overturn the results of the election so he could stay in power. The panel will also show Trump’s involvement in the “fake elector” scheme, involving Republicans in seven battleground states trying to form alternate slates of electors. The plan was for then-Vice President Mike Pence to point to those slates as a reason to cast the election in doubt and not declare Joe Biden as the winner during the Joint Session of Congress counting the Electoral College votes, according to The Washington Post. “We will show courageous state officials who stood up and said they wouldn’t go along with this plan to either call legislatures back into session or decertify the results for Joe Biden,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “The system held because a lot of state and local elections officials upheld their oath to the constitution, a lot of the Republicans, as well as Democrats.” Bowers told the Associated Press Monday he “was appalled” by what has been shown so far at the public hearings. “I think it illuminates something we need to see big time, and take stock of ourselves. And I hope it would sober us,” Bowers said. Trump infamously called Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, asking him to recalculate the certified election results and claiming he had won the race. A recording of the call was first reported by The Washington Post. “All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump told Raffensperger. “Because we won the state.” “We don’t agree that you have won,” Raffensperger replied. Schiff also told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that Mark Meadows, Trump’s then-chief of staff, had “an intimate role … in this plot to put pressure on [Georgia] state legislators and on elections officials.” The committee will reveal new evidence showing that Meadows was both present at a key election meeting in Georgia and suggested sending autographed “Make America Great Again” hats to the people conducting the audits, Schiff told the Times. Moss, the former Georgia election worker testifying, and her mother were the victims of an aggressive smear campaign by Trump and his allies following the election. The two women, who are both Black, faced baseless accusations from the Trump campaign that they processed fake ballots for Biden, comparing the two to drug dealers. After Trump publicly identified them, they said they began receiving racist threats and that strangers began showing up to their homes at night. Earlier this month, Raffensperger and Sterling testified before a grand jury in Fulton County investigating whether Trump broke the law when he pressured state officials to overturn the 2020 election results. Sterling helped oversee the 2020 election and the recount ordered in Georgia because of how close the results were between Biden and Trump. Sterling has also criticized Trump and his election lies, including during a press conference in December 2020. “Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence,” Sterling said, according to PBS NewsHour. “Someone’s going to get hurt. Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed,” Sterling continued. Before contacting officials in Georgia, Trump had also tried to pressure officials in other swing states, including Arizona. Trump, alongside his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, called Bowers after Arizona’s results had been registered, but not certified, in November 2020 to notify him of a state law saying the legislature could pick the state’s electors, according to The Arizona Republic. Bowers questioned the constitutionality of the request and asked for proof, which the pair never produced. “You are giving me nothing but conjecture and asking me to break my oath and commit to doing something I cannot do because I swore I wouldn’t. I will follow the Constitution,” Bowers recounted telling Trump and Giuliani, according to The Arizona Republic. Bowers also said Trump called him again in December 2020, describing their conversation as small talk, but saying the president mentioned their previous call, according to AP. Bowers was also on the receiving end of emails by Ginni Thomas, the wife of conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, following the 2020 election. She urged Bowers in the emails to choose “a clean slate of Electors” and “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure,” according to The Washington Post. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) confirmed the appearance of the election officials at the next hearing. “These individuals are Republicans. They voted for Trump. They are, you know, supported him,” Lofgren told CNN on Saturday. “But they wouldn’t do illegal things that he asked them to do. So we expect to hear in some detail about the pressure that was placed on them and why they were true to the law instead of the pressure.” Aside from live witnesses from Georgia and Arizona, the House panel will also air video testimonies of officials from other states who came under pressure to overturn Biden’s win, according to CNN.

16,Adam Kinzinger Warns Next Presidential Election 'Is Going To Be A Mess',politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said Sunday he is “very worried” about the next presidential election, warning that 2024 “is going to be a mess,” citing a recent example of voting conspiracy theories taking hold. Speaking to ABC’s “This Week,” Kinzinger mentioned New Mexico, where a GOP-led county’s governing commission refused to certify the local election results because of unsubstantiated concerns over voting machines before a judge stepped in. The case echoes voting conspiracy theories in the 2020 election when right-wing personalities and networks accused voting software companies of using technology to skew the election in favor of Joe Biden. “This is the untold thing. We focused so much on what goes on in D.C. and Congress and the Senate,” Kinzinger said. “But when you have these election judges that are going to people that don’t believe basically in democracy, authoritarians, 2024 is going to be a mess.” “And wake up, America. Wake up, Republicans, because this is not going to be good for you if you think it is,” Kinzinger continued. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has reportedly argued over whether to refer Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal charges over his efforts in overturning the results of the 2020 election. The panel has shared damning evidence on former President Donald Trump’s election lies and his last-ditch efforts to stay in power, including his pressure campaign on then-Vice President Mike Pence to not certify the election results. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) on Sunday focused on the tweet Trump sent out as the Capitol was already under siege, accusing Pence of not having “the courage to do what should have been done” over his refusal to reject electoral votes. “When he sent out the tweet attacking his vice president, he already knew that the violence was underway,” Lofgren said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “The only conclusion you can reach is that he intended to accelerate that violence against the former vice president.” Kinzinger, only one of two Republicans sitting on the House panel, told George Stephanopoulos he believes Trump is guilty of “seditious conspiracy,” before adding the House panel is not a criminal charges committee. “I think what we’re presenting before the American people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath,” Kinzinger said. A majority of Americans supports charging the former president for his role in the insurrection, an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in June showed.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) on Sunday focused on the tweet Trump sent out as the Capitol was already under siege, accusing Pence of not having “the courage to do what should have been done” over his refusal to reject electoral votes. “When he sent out the tweet attacking his vice president, he already knew that the violence was underway,” Lofgren said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “The only conclusion you can reach is that he intended to accelerate that violence against the former vice president.” Kinzinger, only one of two Republicans sitting on the House panel, told George Stephanopoulos he believes Trump is guilty of “seditious conspiracy,” before adding the House panel is not a criminal charges committee. “I think what we’re presenting before the American people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath,” Kinzinger said. A majority of Americans supports charging the former president for his role in the insurrection, an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in June showed.

2,Partner Of Capitol Officer Who Died Says She Holds Trump Directly Responsible,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The partner of late U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick said she holds former President Donald Trump directly responsible for the death of her partner and everyone else who died in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Sandra Garza appeared on CNN after Trump again dismissed the attack during a speech in Nashville on Friday and claimed that “nobody was killed except a wonderful young woman named Ashli Babbitt,” whom he said was shot for “no reason” in his opinion. (Babbitt and others were attempting to breach a barricaded door inside the Capitol.) A bipartisan Senate report found that at least seven people had lost their lives in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, including Babbitt, Sicknick and two police officers who died by suicide in the following days. “I am sick and tired of [Trump] trying to downplay or outright deny that ... Brian did not die as a result of January 6. Because he did,” Garza said. “His cause of death was natural. But that does not mean that January 6 did not play a role in his death.” Sicknick was assaulted during the riot, collapsed after returning to his office that day and died about eight hours later. Medical officials said he suffered two strokes and died of natural causes, but “all that transpired played a role in his condition.” Sandra Garza the partner of fallen Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick expresses her anger to @Acosta about Trump floating pardons for insurrectionists, ""I was so angry. He's purposely riling these people up. This is all a game to him."" pic.twitter.com/JQSxx13aDc “I believe that all of the people that died on that day and the days following, you know, would still be here today had it not been for Donald Trump wanting to mess with [our democracy],” Garza said. “Donald Trump wanted to step in there and play a higher power ― that’s what I like to call it ― and mess with people’s lives.” Caroline Edwards, the first U.S. Capitol Police officer injured in the attack, spoke at the June 9 hearing of the House committee investigating the attack, describing the scene on the day as “carnage” and an “absolute war zone.” “[Officers] were bleeding, they were throwing up. ... I saw friends with blood all over their faces, I was slipping in people’s blood,” she said. She recalled seeing Sicknick “with his head in his hands” and looking “ghostly pale” after being hit with what prosecutors later determined was pepper spray. The Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have laid out evidence from testimony and documents that indicate Trump and his allies intentionally lied that the 2020 election was stolen while knowing those claims to be false, ultimately inspiring a mob of Trump supporters to ransack the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results.

3,"Trump Knew He Lost The Election Before He Decided He Didn't, Says Aide",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump knew he lost the 2020 vote to Joe Biden before he decided to attack it out of the blue as a rigged election, a top aide said Sunday. Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House aide, told CNN that she heard Trump privately admit that he lost the election — though he wasn’t happy about it. “Can you believe I lost to this guy?” Trump blurted out as he watched Biden on TV, while Griffin overheard, she said. Criminal intent is critical in charges against Trump over his efforts to overthrow election results, which were clearly legitimate, according to the courts and all recounts across the nation. Nevertheless, a defense attorney could try to argue that Trump “genuinely believed he won the election ... and was trying to stop fraud,” Barbara McQuade, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the New Yorker last week. “Proving mindset is really hard.” But the concept of “willful blindness” could be used against Trump, she noted. “A person cannot ignore the probability that a fact is true” — such as the election was legitimate — “just because he wishes it weren’t true.” Despite Trump’s apparent recognition that he had lost the election, Griffin believes it will be “hard” to prove intent.

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

5,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man.

9,Newt Gingrich's Kamala Harris Insult Barrage Might Be Beneath Even Him,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Far-right pot-stirrer Newt Gingrich mocked Vice President Kamala Harris’ qualifications to be president on Fox News Tuesday. (Watch the video below.) The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

10,"Trump Aimed To 'Accelerate Violence Against' Mike Pence, Says Rep. Zoe Lofgren",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) accused Donald Trump Sunday of deliberately trying to “accelerate the violence” already raging at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, against his vice president, Mike Pence, in a reckless bid to hang on to power. Lofgren, a member of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, pointed to the tweet the former president sent out attacking Pence even as Trump supporters were violently storming the Capitol that day. Former White House aides testified at last week’s House committee hearing that Trump was urged to send a message to help quell the violence. But he instead fired off a tweet mid-riot saying Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done” — referring to Pence’s refusal to reject electoral votes that certified Joe Biden’s victory. A video of the scene at the Capitol after Trump’s tweet shows a rioter then announcing that Pence “betrayed us,” infuriating the crowd. Supporters were soon chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!” “When he sent out the tweet attacking his vice president, he already knew that the violence was underway,” Lofgren said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “The only conclusion you can reach is that he intended to accelerate that violence against the former vice president.” The former president’s niece, Mary Trump, accused her uncle in an interview last week of essentially “handing down a death sentence to Pence,” and suggested that Pence’s murder could have helped Trump claim justification for declaring martial law. Likewise, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman accused Trump on MSNBC on Saturday of “inducing a murderous rage” in his supporters as part of a “set up” against Pence. Lofgren also accused Trump of fomenting a chillingly lawless, violent culture in America today. She pointed to “very conservative” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) being yelled at and “roughed up” by extremist Republicans Saturday at the Texas Republican Party Convention in Houston. “I think that’s what the former president has unleashed here,” she added.

11,Ex-Watergate Prosecutor Says Georgia Probe Is The One That Could 'Send Trump To Jail',politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman said there is a rock-solid case against Donald Trump in the Georgia criminal probe into the former president’s demand that a state official “find” him more votes after the 2020 election. During an interview on MSNBC’s “The Katie Phang Show” on Sunday, Akerman said Trump could likely face an indictment as a Fulton County grand jury investigates his attempt to steal the vote in Georgia. In a recorded call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ahead of the official 2020 vote certification, Trump told the election official to “find” the 11,780 votes needed to reverse his loss to Joe Biden in the state. Akerman, who served as an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former President Richard Nixon, said he believed that tape would be enough to lead to a possible conviction. “If you are asking which of the cases right now, which one is going to send Donald Trump to prison, that is the case,” he said. “There is a really neat three-year felony in Georgia, that Donald Trump has violated. Prosecutors love tape-recorded evidence because you cannot cross-examine it.” “What is significant with those tapes is that when you put it in context of all of the evidence that the January 6 committee has uncovered — you put that together, Donald Trump has zero defense in Georgia,” he added. “If I had to put my money on one prosecution that’s going to go forward here that will send Donald Trump to jail — it’s Georgia.” Trump may have violated several federal laws in his call with Raffensperger. Georgia state law also makes it a crime to willfully tamper with “any electors list, voter’s certificate, numbered list of voters, ballot box, voting machine, direct recording electronic (DRE) equipment, or tabulating machine” or to solicit another person to commit such a felony, punishable by a sentence of up to three years in prison. Trump’s only potential defense would be to “somehow pick up on some ambiguity in the tape, that he did not really mean what he said,” Akerman noted, though he doesn’t think that will stand up. “Put in the context about the January 6th committee has found, I think they have gotten a case beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has laid out damning evidence from thousands of hours of testimony and tens of thousands of pages of documents in hearings this month that create a picture of how Trump and his allies spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and tried to overturn the results despite knowing the accusations were untrue. Trump has argued his conversation with Raffensperger was “PERFECT and appropriate.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The findings by the ABC News/Ipsos survey reveal a very slight uptick in support for prosecution of Trump since the start of televised hearings by the House select committee investigating the insurrection. The new poll, conducted June 17 and 18, found that 58% of those surveyed believe Trump should be charged with a crime for his role. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in April found that 52% of those surveyed thought the same. The latest poll also found that 58% of Americans believe Trump bears either a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the events of Jan. 6 last year. Another 17% believes Trump bears “just some” responsibility. The poll found that 60% believe the House Jan. 6 select committee is conducting a “fair and impartial” investigation. But only 33% of those surveyed said they were following the panel’s hearings “somewhat” or “very” closely.

13,New Texas GOP Platform Declares Homosexuality 'Abnormal Lifestyle Choice',politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost In a giant step into the dark ages, the newly adopted platform of the Texas Republican Party now officially declares that homosexuality is an “abnormal choice.” The shocking platform, voted on by 5,100 delegates and alternates Saturday at the party’s biennial convention in Houston, also affirms Texas Republicans’ opposition to “all efforts to validate transgender identity” ― and calls for a ban on any gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy, for anyone under the age of 21. Yet the platform supports debunked and dangerous conversion therapy — which it terms “Reintegrative Therapy” — to turn members of the LGBTQ community into heterosexuals and eliminate “unwanted same-sex attraction.” The platform spells out other positions explicitly opposed to the LGBTQ community under its section on “Homosexuality and Gender Issues.” It opposes offering any special protections for members of the LGBTQ community, and renounces penalties for those who discriminate against the community. Delegates at the convention were peppered with flyers attacking the LGBTQ community, including one warning: “Beware of the Homosexual Agenda.” I often hear Republicans say they want to make a ""bigger tent"" and to be more inclusive.It's clear that many Texas Republicans don't want LGBT+ people in it.

The Log Cabin Republicans of Texas were denied a booth at the convention, prompting the national Log Cabin organization to denounce the action as “narrow-minded” and “political short-sighted.” The statement warned that the party must “expand the tent” to include members of the LGBTQ community or face election losses. Even Donald Trump Jr. said in an interview that it made no sense to attack fellow Republicans.

Earlier this month, Idaho police arrested 31 members of the Patriot Front hate group who were crammed into a U-Haul truck wearing riot gear as they were heading to disrupt a Pride event in downtown Coeur D’Alene. In other platform issues, party delegates voted to support barring the teaching of sex and sexuality in schools while calling on Texas schools to teach the “dignity of the preborn human” and that life begins at fertilization.

14,The Senate’s Only OB-GYN Is Pushing Misinformation About The Abortion Pill,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost For Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), a former Planned Parenthood executive and strong proponent of women’s reproductive rights, it’s infuriating enough that the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. So last week, during a committee hearing on a bill about Food and Drug Administration user fees, when Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) casually tried to amend the bill to require women to see a doctor and get an ultrasound before being allowed to use the abortion pill, Smith was livid. “Completely unnecessary,” she told him in Tuesday’s hearing. “This amendment would force women who are seeking a medication abortion to be diagnosed in person and only after this unnecessary procedure,” she said. “To be clear, these kinds of [transvaginal] ultrasounds do not have a medical purpose within 10 weeks of pregnancy, which is the time frame for when women are able to access a medication abortion.” Smith tweeted about it after the hearing, too, saying there is “zero” reason for Marshall’s proposal and accusing him of “punishing women for seeking a common medical procedure.” That could have been the end of it. After all, Smith was right: Medication abortion, also called the abortion pill, was approved by the FDA in 2000 and is safe, effective and widely prescribed for miscarriage and abortion care within the first 10 weeks. It’s also the most common method of abortion in the country, accounting for about 60% of all abortions. As of December, women don’t even have to go to a doctor’s office to get the two-pill regimen. The FDA waived that rule to let doctors prescribe it through telehealth consultations and mail it to patients in states where it’s permitted by law. That was just before a March study found that medication abortion can be dispensed without an ultrasound or a physical exam, a study with far-reaching implications given that ultrasound machines cost thousands of dollars and require specialized training. But Marshall, who likes to tout that he’s the Senate’s only OB-GYN, tweeted back at Smith — this time making an outlandish claim about the dangers of the abortion pill. “Women will die if they skip this step,” Marshall said, referring to an ultrasound, “and babies will be born with birth defects as the drug is less effective at a later gestational age.” Dying women! Babies with birth defects! This is outrageous! It’s also not true. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the premier professional organization for OB-GYNs, responded to HuffPost’s request for comment almost immediately when asked about Marshall’s claims. “ACOG does not support this statement,” said Kate Connors, a spokeswoman for the organization. “Medication abortion is safe and effective, and evidence shows it can be provided safety and effectively through telehealth, let alone without an ultrasound.” Connors also pointed HuffPost to ACOG’s official guidance on medication abortion, which, for anyone interested in a medical explanation of what’s going on, she said “discusses what he is incorrectly extrapolating: misoprostol may be teratogenic in the first trimester. However, the data show that dating a pregnancy by last menstrual period is sufficient for identifying a patient who is indicated for medication abortion, so ultrasound dating is NOT necessary.” Smith, meanwhile, ripped her Republican colleague for “pushing disinformation” about the safety of medication abortion, which is safer than Tylenol. “Sen. Marshall is an OB-GYN. He knows what the standard is,” she told HuffPost in a recent interview, accusing him of “hiding behind his doctor’s degree” to try to scare women away from getting a safe abortion. The Minnesota Democrat said it’s important to note the context of Marshall’s claims. “He’s doing this as we are probably days away from the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and many will be turning to medication abortion as a way of accessing abortion,” Smith said. “He’s trying to make that difficult, too … as we think about the future of abortion care where Roe v. Wade is overturned.” Asked for comment in response to ACOG and Smith saying his claims about abortion medication are wildly untrue, a Marshall spokesman provided a lengthy statement about the senator being a proud OB-GYN. “I will always be an OBGYN first,” Marshall said in his emailed statement. “When I see political agendas that will harm patients it’s my obligation to speak up.” The Kansas senator went on to claim that women taking an abortion pill without first getting an ultrasound “will lead to missed ectopic pregnancies and woman [sic] dying.” He also claimed that without getting ultrasounds first, women will get the pills beyond the approved 70-day window, which he said could cause “significant birth defects, as well as lead to delay in prenatal care and higher rates of undiagnosed diabetes, blood clots, and preeclampsia.” “As an OBGYN for 30 years, I delivered more than 5,000 babies but I also treated hemorrhaging patients in the ER that resulted from failed terminations,” Marshall said, before touting his medical credentials again. “As one of only four physicians in the U.S Senate and the only OBGYN, it is in the best interest for the safety and wellbeing of women and unborn children to require medical imaging prior to prescribing chemical abortion pills.” Once again, ACOG strongly rejected Marshall’s claims. The fact that Marshall uses the term “chemical abortion” at all is hugely inappropriate, said Connors, as ACOG has explicitly called that out as “biased, non-clinical language.” “If anything will cost the lives of pregnant people, it will be the gross and deliberate misinterpretation of scientific data to restrict access to abortion based on politics and ideology.” Beyond that, Dr. Jen Villavicencio, ACOG’s leader of equity transformation and an OB-GYN with a specialty in complex family planning, said Marshall’s claims are downright dangerous for women. “If anything will cost the lives of pregnant people, it will be the gross and deliberate misinterpretation of scientific data to restrict access to abortion based on politics and ideology,” Villavicencio told HuffPost in a statement. “As a doctor who is currently delivering babies, operating on people with life-threatening ectopics, and providing abortion care, I can say both policies and the practice of medicine should reflect sound science and clear evidence,” she said. “Abortion restrictions are clearly not supported by data. Medication abortion is a very safe, effective medical intervention and for many people, requiring ultrasounds only serve as a barrier to care.” The Supreme Court will conclude its term during the last week of June or the first week of July. It is widely expected to overturn Roe v. Wade by then. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Drag Queen Accuses Gubernatorial Candidate Kari Lake Of Rank Hypocrisy,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost One of Arizona’s best-known drag queens has taken off his gloves to attack longtime former pal and professed MAGA fanatic gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake for what he considers her baldfaced hypocrisy about drag shows. Lake’s campaign indignantly tweeted Friday that “they kicked God out of schools and welcomed the Drag Queens. They took down our Flag and replaced it with a rainbow.” But Lake has attended “countless” drag shows and private events featuring Richard Stevens, who has performed for 25 years as sassy Barbra Seville, the Arizona Republic reported Friday. Stevens has shared text messages from Lake, and photos and social media posts of her links to Stevens and drag shows. Stevens told the newspaper he once even performed as Marilyn Monroe in front of Lake’s daughter when she was 9 or 10 years old. They kicked God out of schools and welcomed the Drag Queens. They took down our Flag and replaced it with a rainbow. They seek to disarm Americans and militarize our Enemies.Let’s bring back the basics:God, Guns & Glory. 🇺🇸 “She’s picked a side in the culture war, but her actions in the past don’t support it,” Stevens told the Republic in an article published Saturday. “Of course my feelings are hurt. It just proves that she is a hypocrite. ... She’s thrown away my friendship to get votes from people that would rather hate gays or hate drag queens,” said Stevens. In a 2014 Instagram message — unearthed by Brahm Resnick, a reporter with NBC affiliate KPNX in Phoenix — Lake writes: “Half of what I learned about makeup I learned from watching friends like Barbra Seville.” UPDATE 3 And there's this from @KariLake's insta: ""Half of what I learned about makeup I learned from watching friends like Barbra Seville."" pic.twitter.com/dMjtR8oh5Q Lake’s campaign told KPNX on Saturday that “Richard’s accusations are full of lies.” The candidate’s spokesperson, Ross Trumble, told the Republic that Lake’s daughter had attended a baby shower where Stevens “showed up as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.” It “wasn’t a drag show, and the issue we’re talking about isn’t adults attending drag shows, either,” the campaign told KPNX. “The issue is activists sexualizing children and that has got to stop.” A campaign statement also noted: “Not once has [Lake’s] daughter been to a drag show. But since she is over the age of 18, if she chooses to do so, that’s completely up to her.” The campaign apparently did not address whether Lake and Stevens, who was referred to by his first name, had been friends, or whether Lake attended drag shows. Others have accused Lake, who was previously a Democrat, of faking her right-wing credentials and indignation in a bid to ride the extremist train to victory over Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.

16,How An Elite Christian College Became A Battleground In America’s Culture Wars,politics," Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost A few months after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize same-sex marriage, a college senior in Michigan wrote an essay on why his church should do the same. In 2004, Joseph Kuilema was getting ready to graduate from Calvin College, an affiliate of the U.S. Christian Reformed Church that is based in Grand Rapids and has a few hundred thousand followers scattered mostly across the Upper Midwest. The CRC is a Protestant denomination that sees the Bible as “inspired and infallible” truth, while drawing upon three Reformation-era texts called “confessions” to explain what that truth means in real life. Among the lessons the CRC takes from these writings is its position on same-sex relationships. The CRC promotes love for gay members, calling past hostility toward the LGBTQ community “a great failing.” But it also deems homosexual behavior “incompatible” with Scripture because, in the church’s view, intimacy is a divine gift reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. The CRC first staked out that position in 1973. Kuilema, writing three decades later, explained why he thought it was wrong. In a paper that he called “Tuxes for Two” and submitted for a course on theological ethics, Kuilema highlighted what he saw as inconsistencies in CRC doctrine and argued for interpreting religious texts in the context of their times, which, he said, meant focusing on the nature of the loving, lifelong partnership the Bible celebrates rather than whether it is between a man and woman. “This is about … couples who are in love, devoted to God and the Christian faith, ready to embark on a lifelong journey of commitment and mutuality,” Kuilema wrote. Aggressively interrogating such widely accepted principles of faith would have qualified as rebellion at many Christian colleges. At Calvin, it was a tradition, with students following a tone set by the faculty. School policies explicitly allowed professors room to criticize elements of CRC orthodoxy as long as they agreed to conduct their lives according to the church’s rules. And in a long-running internal CRC debate over how to temper biblical writings with contemporary values, Calvin faculty were frequently among those pushing hardest for more progressive views. That environment is one reason that Kuilema returned to Calvin several years after graduation, to become a tenure-track professor in the social work department. As a researcher, he focused on the intersections between faith and activism. As a teacher, he directed study abroad programs in Liberia. He liked to speak out on issues related to race, once drawing the scorn of Tucker Carlson’s website, and became a visible ally to Calvin’s LGBTQ students, one of whom later came to him with a request. Nicole Sweda had gotten to know Kuilema when she was an openly queer undergraduate and had kept in touch with him afterward, when she got a full-time job at a research center that operated within the school. She was getting ready to wed her longtime girlfriend, and the two were hoping Kuilema could officiate the ceremony. Kuilema agreed, reasoning that it would be compliant with Calvin faculty rules because he wasn’t the one getting married ― and because the ceremony would be secular and on his own time. He checked with the elders at his Grand Rapids church, which is part of the CRC, as well as his department chair at Calvin. They said they were fine with it. But Kuilema had run afoul of Calvin officials before. In 2018, the Board of Trustees overruled a faculty recommendation and blocked his tenure, citing concerns over the “tone and substance” of past statements about the LGBTQ community. Kuilema had remained at Calvin afterward, working on a two-year renewable contract that was serving as a probationary period. Presiding at the wedding risked drawing more official ire. At the same time, Kuilema thought, there was a higher authority to consider ― and more important imperatives to follow. “For me, the religious question was not whether God approves of such unions, I think God absolutely does, but whether I would be faithful to God,” Kuilema told me recently, thinking back to why he decided to go ahead. “The question was whether I would practice what I preach and be willing to accept whatever consequences that might follow.” Those consequences would soon become clear ― and upend his life. In early December, about two months after the wedding and just as Kuilema’s newest reappointment was on the verge of approval, he was summoned to a meeting with the provost, Noah Toly. Somebody had sent Toly a photo of Kuilema officiating the wedding. When Kuilema confirmed that the image was authentic, he learned that his reappointment was on hold, pending a fuller investigation and discussion of whether that should affect his contract status. Kuilema wasn’t the only one facing consequences. In January, Sweda got a calendar invite for her own meeting with Toly, whom she had never met. There, Sweda told me later, officials asked her to verify her relationship status and told her that she was in violation of Calvin guidelines. Sweda said she hadn’t known the rules for staff prohibited same-sex relationships, then she asked nervously, “Am I being fired?” After a few more weeks, and while administrators were still weighing their options, a reporter for the student newspaper, Chimes, broke the story of Kuilema, the wedding and the possibility of employment repercussions, instantly turning the private matter into a public controversy and exposing deep rifts in the Calvin community over not just the fate of a student and beloved professor, but also the future of the institution itself. The story has since gone national, with coverage in several religion and higher-education publications. The controversy at Calvin has a lot in common with disputes elsewhere in the U.S., including an ongoing fight over anti-gay hiring policies that has divided students, faculty and trustees at Seattle Pacific University, a medium-sized Christian college, as well as a possible split of the United Methodist Church into two denominations, one recognizing same-sex marriage and one continuing to reject it. And there are echoes of fights playing out in other contexts, including the political debates over classroom discussion of sexual orientation in Florida and over transgender athletes competing in collegiate sports. The same underlying tensions are also at the heart of a  lawsuit, pending in federal court, over a special exemption that allows religious schools to collect federal education funds even if they have policies that discriminate against LGBTQ students or faculty. The thread running through all these controversies is a clash between the traditional and the modern ― between those who think their worlds have already changed too much and those who want them to change more ― over a whole set of cultural issues but especially over those related to sexuality. And at Calvin, it’s fast becoming an existential crisis, with newer generations of students and many faculty pushing the school to accept and embrace the LBGTQ community more firmly while outside forces pull in the opposite direction. Among those outside forces are some wealthy donors and alumni, including at least one with ties to the DeVos-Prince family, one of the most influential financiers of conservative politics in the U.S. Another source of pressure are parents of Calvin students, specifically the ones who expect the school to shield their kids from a culture they believe promotes LGBTQ behavior. Then there’s the CRC itself, whose governing congress, the Synod, this week voted to elevate its position on LGBTQ matters from “pastoral guidance” (which effectively allows some room for questioning and dissent) to “confessional” status (which doesn't). A number of Calvin professors have already threatened to leave if the vote leads to change in school policies. In the past, Calvin’s leaders have frequently tried to find a middle ground on issues related to sexuality by talking up academic freedom even as they pledged fealty to biblical authority, and by preaching love even as their policies condemned the behavior of LGBTQ students. Today that middle ground feels less stable than ever. Many in and around Calvin wonder how much longer it can hold and fear what the school will become if it doesn’t. The first time I met Joe Kuilema was in early May, at a coffee shop about two miles from campus. He is tall and slender, with a full beard and bald head, and as he sat across from me in a booth to tell his story, he talked with an animated enthusiasm that made it easy to understand why undergraduates voted him “teacher of the year” in 2019. The eatery had a hipster feel, with exposed brick walls, hardwood floors and industrial track lighting. Nothing about the scene would have felt out of place in Cambridge or Berkeley, or in Ann Arbor, for that matter, although there are reasons that Kuilema’s academic trajectory took him instead to Grand Rapids — and to Calvin. One of those reasons is faith. Another is family. Kuilema’s lineage traces back to the Dutch immigrants who settled in western Michigan in the 19th and early 20th centuries and today remain a dominant presence in that part of the state. The first wave established the CRC to carry on the traditions of the churches they had known in the Netherlands and established a Calvin seminary to train clergy who could lead services in their native language. Later, school administrators broadened the academic mission and spun off the non-ministerial division, which became Calvin College ― and more recently, Calvin University ― although the close relationship to the CRC remained. To this day, the church has direct governing responsibility over the college, plus it supplies a portion of the operating budget. But historically Calvin administrators haven’t tried to wall the school off from the outside world in the way some other Christian colleges have ― which is why, in the late 1960s, some of the turmoil that was roiling the rest of America seeped into the Calvin campus. Among those caught up in it were Kuilema’s parents, who met when they were both undergraduates and whom Kuilema described as “long-haired hippies.” His father once helped produce a spoof of the official CRC newspaper that featured a drawing of the famous Iwo Jima flag-raising but with a giant dollar bill instead of the Stars and Stripes on the pole. Several years and a few haircuts later, Kuilema’s father came back to Calvin as an employee, serving in a variety of high-ranking administrative roles. But neither he nor Kuilema’s mother ever stopped pushing for change ― in the world, in the church or on campus. One of Kuilema’s most vivid childhood memories is from 1990, when he would have been 8 years old, and his mother was participating in a demonstration to protest the CRC’s traditional prohibition on women holding leadership roles in churches. Kuilema and his two sisters went along, sitting in delegate chairs, holding lighted candles and singing along with the protest chants. Years later, the CRC’s Synod officially adopted a new position that gave individual churches discretion over whether to accept women leaders, though it would take 12 more years before they let women vote on denominational decisions. Kuilema says that watching his parents made a big impression and led directly to his professional choices. “My father’s trajectory from radical student protesting Vietnam and publishing subversive magazines to respected Calvin employee was part of what convinced me that there was room for someone like me at Calvin,” he said. When Kuilema was getting ready to join the Calvin faculty, in 2008, he mentioned his belief that the CRC should support same-sex marriage. The dean responded by noting that many other Calvin professors felt the same way. Which wasn’t surprising. A small but growing minority of religious scholars from across Christian faiths had been arguing that the anti-LGBTQ reading of Scripture was too literal and too selective. Several found a home at Calvin, where professors have long had license to engage in wide-ranging debates, even those touching directly on issues of faith. But professors also sign pledges to live by the CRC’s rules for conduct. They aren’t supposed to challenge the CRC’s most fundamental beliefs. And although there’s a lot of disagreement over exactly where that line is, sometimes professors have gotten into trouble because the administration believed they had crossed it. In 2009, a pair of religion professors published a paper stating that fossil records made it impossible to believe a biblical Adam and Eve had been exiled from a garden paradise, effectively calling into question the CRC’s understanding of original sin. Among those who expressed outrage was Gaylen Byker, who was president of Calvin back then and also happened to be a prominent Republican Party donor. One of the paper co-authors ended up leaving, under undisclosed terms, prompting one school critic to write in the Chronicle of Education that the episode had “stained” Calvin’s reputation. A major controversy over the treatment of the LGBTQ community had started just a few years before, over a play called “Seven Passages” that was about LGBTQ life in conservative Christian communities in the Midwest. The author was Stephanie Sandberg, a Calvin theater professor. She’d gotten the idea for it after meeting with a distraught undergraduate who was afraid to tell his parents that he was gay. While working on it, she told me, she was careful to keep her faculty superiors informed of her work and to underwrite the project with independent funding. “Seven Passages” played to a month of sold-out shows at a Grand Rapids theater. Calvin faculty attended, including some who were also part of a panel on LGBTQ issues that Sandberg moderated on campus. A production company even decided to make a film version. But an outraged CRC pastor in Iowa wrote Calvin officials and the elders at Sandberg’s Grand Rapids church, accusing her of violating church orthodoxy. The Board of Trustees responded with a statement saying that “advocacy of homosexual practice and same-sex marriage is not permitted” ― and stood by its pronouncement even after 36 to 4 vote in the Faculty Senate calling on the trustees to withdraw it. Over the next few years, a college working group produced a series of new guidelines for faculty behavior that made a point of recognizing the need for academic freedom. But it also called on professors to check in with their academic superiors whenever their work might question or undermine core CRC beliefs. It’s impossible to understand the controversies at Calvin without recognizing how rapidly the world around it has changed and how threatening those changes feel to some parts of the school’s community. Nicole Sweda has seen both parts of that story. She arrived for her first year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court had just made same-sex marriage the law of the land, with the public strongly approving. Car companies and other retailers were sponsoring Pride events and targeting gay customers with ads. It was no longer a big deal to see openly gay figures in business, politics or professional sports ― and at Sweda’s large public high school in Rochester Hills, an upscale Detroit suburb, it wasn’t a big deal, either. “Honestly, I didn’t feel like anybody cared,” Sweda told me. “Freshman or sophomore year, you’d sometimes hear people still say, ‘That’s so gay’ or whatever, but by the end of high school, even that wasn’t the case anymore. It was going out of style.” Sweda played bass and snare drum in the marching band and developed a relationship with Annica Steen, who played flute and who came out as queer later in high school. For college, Steen chose Grand Valley State University, a public institution just outside Grand Rapids with more than 20,000 students. Sweda opted for Calvin, which had only about 3,000 students and where two of her siblings had gone. Sweda knew that Calvin’s code for students prohibited intimacy among same-sex couples as part of its demand for chastity outside of marriage. But during campus visits, she’d seen students and instructors wearing pride buttons. She had also taken notice of Calvin’s Sexuality and Gender Awareness (SAGA) peer support group, which it publicized on its website, and a speaker series on sexuality the university had sponsored. Other prospective students came to Calvin with similar impressions ― among them, Lindsay Owens, who grew up in a conservative, rural Ohio town and who told me she felt out of place there because of her Mexican ethnicity as well as her sexual orientation. During high school, Owens had attended a summer program at Calvin for racial and ethnic minority students, led by progressive faculty and full of like-minded participants. When it came time to apply for college, she checked out Calvin and saw the SAGA web page. She also took note that the CRC’s position didn’t actually condemn people for being gay, only for acting on it. “People on my Facebook page will talk about how it’s a perversion or something like that, how it can be cured and all sorts of stuff,” said Owens, who graduated this year. “Calvin doesn’t take that position. … They affirm that God loves you, you’re fine the way you are. They say they just don’t want you to act on it, and that automatically seems more welcoming to people who come from my background.” But once on campus, Owens and many other students felt as if Calvin’s accommodations had limits. SAGA offered a “safe space” but wasn’t able to operate as an advocacy organization, which it does on other campuses. Resident advisers believed they couldn’t be in LGBTQ relationships, even celibate ones, making it difficult to accept a position that many of them needed to help pay their bills. The policies themselves are not so clear. In response to written questions, university spokesperson Matthew Kucinski confirmed that the school “discouraged romantic same-sex dating relationships” among resident advisers while adding that “it’s important to note that we’ve never fired an RA for dating someone of the same gender.” He stressed that Calvin is a “caring and diverse community” and said the school has “worked hard to help those within our community who identify as LGBTQ+ to feel a sense of belonging.” But to students like Owens, the school’s message isn’t ambiguous. “The supports Calvin does have are not like, ‘Let’s celebrate your being queer and let’s celebrate your identity.’ It’s very much, ‘Let’s help you as you’re struggling.’ And that comes off very much like there’s something wrong with you.” Harm Venhuizen, the student journalist who broke the Kuilema story and graduated this spring, said he can understand how prospective students get the wrong impression. “You come to Calvin and you visit; you might be told there’s an organization for gay students on campus, there are Pride flags around campus,” he told me. “It’s something that exists at Calvin. But it’s something that’s bound, too ― something that is restricted by policy and not as affirming as promotional materials might lead you to think.” Students weren’t the only ones who felt disappointment. Julia Smith, who was on the Calvin staff and ran the sexuality speaker series from 2008 to 2019, said administrators routinely fielded angry feedback from parents and alumni that sometimes filtered down to her. In one instance, she said, “an influential person close to big money” sent a long email full of “anti-trans talking points,” pushing her to disinvite a gay speaker. Another time, she said, a manager arranged for a meeting with a parent who objected to the whole approach of exposing students to LGBTQ speakers. The parent wanted to know Smith’s personal view on same-sex marriage. Smith said she refused to answer and feared that, if she had, she might have lost her job. “They affirm that God loves you, you’re fine the way you are. They say they just don’t want you to act on it, and that automatically seems more welcoming to people who come from my background.” Sexual orientation wasn’t the underlying issue the first time Kuilema was part of a public controversy. A 2015 column he wrote about white privilege landed him on the “Professor Watchlist” from the right-wing group Turning Point USA and made him the focus of an article in The Daily Caller, the conservative publication Tucker Carlson founded and was still editing at the time. (Headline: “Professor Blames White Privilege for the Existence of Michigan.”) When the publicity led to a wave of angry emails and social media posts, including a few death threats, more than 100 of Kuilema’s colleagues rallied to his defense with an open letter asking to be part of the same watchlist. It was testimony to the high regard he had among fellow scholars and the main reason he was optimistic about his chances for tenure in 2018, especially because he also had enthusiastic backing from his department and dean. Kuilema’s final interview with the screening committee went so well that he wrote a Facebook post afterward thanking all of the people who had helped his career ― and noting that he seemed likely to get tenure even though, as he admitted, he had gently poked the administration. The “poke” he had in mind was yet another statement he’d made, during the interview, about his feelings about the LGBTQ community and the church’s posture toward it. He told me he mentioned it for the same reason he did when he first joined the faculty: He thought honesty demanded that he be upfront about his feelings. But Kuilema didn’t get tenure. The Board of Trustees rejected the recommendations, and in a letter outlining its rationale cited a number of instances (including the Facebook post) when he’d made public or private statements about LGBTQ issues. The letter noted the tradition of such dissent at Calvin but said it was important to express such disagreement with a “tone” and “strategy” that was more respectful toward the CRC and its positions. “The Board needs more evidence that your communications, whether written or spoken, formal or informal, serve to strengthen the college and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways,” the letter said. Several professors later told Chimes that they could not recall another instance of the trustees overruling a screening committee recommendation, let alone one that was so strong and backed by so many members of the faculty. But instead of leaving, Kuilema took up the trustees’ offer (which was itself unusual) to stay on at Calvin, with a two-year contract that could be renewed, in order to demonstrate that he could address their concerns. Kuilema took several steps, like taking care to recruit panelists who held the traditional position for an LGBTQ “teach-in” and giving plenty of emphasis to the CRC’s position during a classroom lecture ― so much so that a student complained it gave short shrift to the pain people experience when they must hide their identities. Kuilema also began working with Micah Watson, a politically conservative, Princeton-educated political scientist who believes the traditional CRC posture on LGBTQ issues represents the most honest reading of Scripture and the confessions. Watson bristles at the suggestion that the CRC (or Calvin) should “condemn” people for what they feel or desire; in an interview, he said he hopes that both would continue to welcome members of the LGBTQ community. The goal, he said, should be to set clearer standards for behavior and then “be pastoral, understanding and grace-filled” to “those of us who, for whatever reason, have a hard time living up to the standard.” Kuilema said one reason he sought out Watson was that he wanted to demonstrate he could engage with such arguments and their advocates respectfully, which was something else the trustees had questioned. Kuilema told me later that the collaboration helped him sort out his own thoughts ― and that he has enjoyed getting to know the more senior professor, whom he considers a friend. Watson said pretty much the same thing about Kuilema, describing him as intellectually serious, well-versed in Scripture and full of integrity. “I like Joe,” he said. On the day of the wedding, Kuilema said, he was calm for the first time in weeks. Early in his remarks, he followed the couple’s request to memorialize their union as significant without turning the ceremony into a political statement. He mentioned the “difficult and painful decisions about who is safe to be open with” that the two had frequently faced ― and how, just a few years prior, “we would not have been able to stand here and legally marry you.” Then he spoke about their relationship, echoing the sentiments of his old senior class paper and throwing in a corny joke about the two former marching band performers making music together. “You have built your relationship together, with few models for how to do so or what it might look like, and you have built something beautiful,” Kuilema said. The ceremony went well, and so did the celebration, despite some morning rain and a lack of fall colors that Sweda and Steen had hoped for when they picked the October date. They danced to “Golden Hour” by Kacey Musgraves and managed to get a few bites of the beef tenderloin and goat cheese-stuffed mushrooms from the buffet. Sweda said she felt disappointed that one college friend had opted not to attend, apparently because the friend’s husband objected to the ceremony on principle. But they still had about 150 guests, including some other Calvin faculty, alumni and students. “The overriding emotion was just joy,” Kuilema said. “It was such a beautiful day.” Sweda and Steen told me they were careful when posting about the wedding on social media, consciously excluding photos of Kuilema presiding because they didn’t want anybody to accuse him of using the wedding to make a public statement. To this day, neither they nor Kuilema knows who sent the image to Toly, the provost ― and Toly wouldn’t tell me. But when the summons to the meetings came, both Kuilema and Sweda knew something was amiss. Sweda told me she got even more scared when the other officials present began the meeting with a prayer, asking for God’s help to give her peace. “It felt very ominous,” Sweda said. It took a few weeks for administrators to sort out her situation. Eventually they cut ties with the research center where she worked, allowing it to operate independently. The decision took many faculty members by surprise, but it meant that the center was free of Calvin’s personnel rules and Sweda could have a job. Kuilema wasn’t so lucky. In April, he got a five-page, single-spaced memo from the dean, Benita Wolters-Fredlund, acknowledging his “stellar record” as a scholar, teacher and colleague, and quoting several professors who gushed at length about his work. But, Wolters-Fredlund explained, the decision to preside at the wedding and failure to consult anybody in the top echelons of campus governance was a “serious lapse in judgment” that threatened the university’s integrity, especially given that Sweda was a Calvin employee. Because of this judgment lapse, Wolters-Fredlund said, the university was not renewing his contract. The memo made it clear that Kuilema could file an appeal, which he promptly set about doing, although he knew it meant winning over some of the same officials who had already ruled against him ― and who were subject to pressures of their own. “We all at various points in our lives join communities or institutions that have rules or norms we wouldn’t make ourselves.” Colleges around the country are about to hit a demographic cliff when the population of potential new first-year students will decline by as much as 15% ― enough to threaten financial stability at all but the most elite, sought-after and generously funded schools. The situation is even more dire for colleges that draw heavily from the Midwest, because of out-migration. On top of that, Calvin is still recovering from a period of unrelated financial instability that led to buyouts, layoffs and eliminations of whole departments. One consequence of that pressure is that campus controversies can have serious fiscal implications, especially when they touch on hot-button political issues of interest to powerful alumni. A former Calvin official told me it was widely known that a number of major donors was angry and in some cases stopped providing contributions after all the national publicity about Claire Murashima, who in 2020 came out as Calvin’s first openly queer student body president. Current Calvin officials wouldn’t comment on that except to point out that donor reactions to news are common and run in both directions. But nationally, “it’s often the donors and conservative trustees who are opposed to full LGBTQ inclusion,” according to Jonathan Coley, an Oklahoma State University sociologist and author of “Gay on God’s Campus: Mobilizing for LGBT Equality at Christian Colleges and Universities.” At Calvin, it’s no secret that one high-profile university supporter, Allan Hoekstra, resigned from the Board of Trustees in 2020 at least partly because of the school’s handling of LGBTQ students. Hoekstra is president of a real estate holding company in nearby Holland, Michigan. He is also a prominent figure in conservative circles with ties to the DeVos and Prince families, who together form one of the most powerful dynasties in national right-wing politics. (As of mid-2020, according to tax filings, Hoekstra was secretary/treasurer of the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, which has in the past financed Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and other organizations promoting a Christian conservative agenda.) Among the DeVos and Prince family members who received their undergraduate degrees at Calvin is Betsy DeVos, the conservative activist who has championed Christian schooling and served as education secretary in the Trump administration. One of the largest donations in Calvin’s history was a pair of $10 million contributions, one each from DeVos and Prince family foundations, that underwrote construction of the DeVos Communications Center and the Prince Conference Center. The DeVos center is now home to an institute that focuses on Christianity and public life. In 2021, Hoekstra wrote an email to several officials and professors in which he recounted some of the reasons he’d stepped away from the board a year earlier. He mentioned some recent university-sponsored seminars on inclusiveness, one of which he called a “roadshow,” as well as a story he had heard about a Calvin graduate who “had a double mastectomy, changed her identity from she to he and married her female partner.” “Parents and students have the right to believe teaching at Calvin will reflect that sex has its rightful place in the context of a marriage between one man and one woman,” Hoekstra wrote. “I could not remain as a trustee, who had executed the very same Covenant as you, knowing that faculty members were endorsing same sex marriage and the board and administration was unwilling to hold them accountable to the prescribed process.” Kuilema told me he thinks he’s the professor in the email, although he can’t be sure. Hoekstra declined to answer questions about either the email or his broader feelings about the school. As for the reference to parents, that resonates with what a number of people in the greater Calvin universe told me about the school, the image and its future as a financially stable institution. “Some parents send their children to Calvin, or to some other Christian school, in order to stop them from being gay,” said Smith, who ran the speaker series. “It doesn’t actually work that way,” she added quickly. But in the face of a shrinking enrollment pool, and given that families with more affirming attitudes might be less interested in a religious school anyway, Calvin has a strong incentive to make sure the school remains appealing to families who expect it to remain a bulwark against a culture increasingly supportive of the LGBTQ community. “The market really plays to conservative Christians in the Christian college orbit,” said Kristin Du Mez, a history professor and author of the 2020 bestseller “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.” “I can say that whereas before I’ve always felt like I belonged at Calvin … that’s now an open question. And I think it is for many of us.” Kuilema started the 23-page letter appealing the school’s decision on his contract by recounting his deep ties to the college. “I love Calvin University,” he wrote, noting that both his parents and his wife were graduates and that he had been part of campus life since he was a kid. He also spoke about his faith and its centrality to his work: “I love the idea of being ‘reformed and always reforming according to the word of God,’ the sense that God is alive and active, moving and working in God’s creation, and that we return again and again to God’s word to discern and confess what each new moment demands of us.” Under faculty guidelines, a successful appeal requires demonstration of procedural errors or injustices ― or relevant information that university officials lacked while making their decision. Kuilema said there were several, arguing that faculty guidelines were unclear about the restrictions on conduct and whose permission he needed to seek. He argued that his church, not Calvin officials, were the rightful arbiters of whether his actions violated CRC doctrine. He also recounted his efforts to demonstrate he could live up to the standards in the tenure denial letter while reprising some of his substantive critiques of the CRC position. By this time, his case was getting media attention and public support ― through those online alumni and faculty petitions, plus an opinion article in Chimes, written by psychology professor Emily Helder, hailing his contributions and warning that “I am finding it increasingly difficult to work at Calvin with integrity.” It was amid the growing outcry that I met with Noah Toly at his campus office on a rainy day in early May. Toly is something of an outsider at Calvin. He’s not from the Midwest and didn’t grow up in the CRC, although he belonged to churches with similar theological bearings. He came to Calvin from Wheaton College, the evangelical Protestant school in Illinois where he was an undergraduate and then a professor of urban studies and politics. His 2020 book, “The Gardeners’ Dirty Hands: Environmental Politics and Christian Ethics,” uses Greek and biblical texts to think through debates about climate change, which he believes is real and requires policy responses. Its theme is the need to recognize and accept the tradeoffs ― even painful ones. Toly maintained the institution’s silence on the specifics of the Kuilema case but addressed some of the broader issues it raised for an institution like Calvin ― including the apparent tension between academic freedom and fealty to biblical authority, which, Toly said, didn’t really exist in the way many outsiders imagine. “We assume that God has made that world both good and intelligible to us and has called us and equipped us for vocations of serious intellectual inquiry,” he said, calling Calvin’s commitment to academic freedom one of its great virtues. “And we believe that that inquiry is not going to lead us to conclusions that are against the grain of God’s truth as revealed in Scripture or taught by the church.” When I pressed Toly about the obligations of faculty who find CRC positions on issues like same-sex marriage objectionable and who believe Scripture is on their side, he said the university respects the right to dissent. But, he said, “the expectation to abide by those positions remains even for those who disagree.” Calvin’s position will only become more precarious following the big Synod vote this past week, which makes opposition to same-sex relationships a matter of confessional status ― in other words, something that congregations can’t violate. Many observes believe it will turn the existing divide over sexuality within the denomination into a potentially irreparable breach, in ways that resemble the broader polarization of U.S. politics. Congregations with more affluent, more highly educated members are more likely to recognize LGBTQ relationships. Many of them are in and around Grand Rapids, whose downtown is full of bars and restaurants with pride flags. One of churches recently elected a deacon who is in a same-sex marriage. Congregations in more rural areas and with more blue-collar members are more likely to have the traditional view, that same-sex marriage and homosexual activity more generally is sinful. So do many foreign chapters within the CRC, which have been providing a critical source of new membership at a time when churchgoing across denominations in the U.S. is falling. During the debate at the Synod, those foreign CRC congregations were among those supporting adoption of the stricter human sexuality standard, according to an account in The Banner. It could take a few years for the results of the Synod vote on sexuality to take full effect as the denomination goes through its own process of bureaucratic implementation. But there’s already widespread talk of individual churches breaking away from the CRC. At Calvin, prominent faculty, such as history professor Du Mez, are openly questioning what it all means for the denomination and the school. “I can say that whereas before I’ve always felt like I belonged at Calvin and within the CRC, that’s now an open question,” Du Mez told me. “And I think it is for many of us.” “The hardest thing, I think, has been seeing LGBTQ students wrestle with this. What does this mean for them? And can they still be here?” Whatever Calvin’s future, Kuilema won’t be part of it. In late May, he got a letter from Bruce Los, chair of the Board of the Trustees. It was just two pages and conspicuously lacking in the pleasantries of earlier communications. It disputed Kuilema’s claims, concluding that he failed to show either process errors or incomplete information in the university decision. Absent those two conditions, Los said, there was no grounds for reversal. Los said the university’s decision did not represent a substantive judgment on either Calvin or CRC policies toward the LGBTQ community. The core issue, he said, was Kuilema’s failure to work “within college policies and procedures” and to act in ways that would “strengthen the [university] and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways.” The decision shook other professors, including Rachel Venema, who joined the faculty about the same time that Kuilema did and, like him, has a Calvin undergraduate degree. When we spoke in May, while Kuilema’s appeal was still pending, Venema said she was torn about her future. “The hardest thing, I think, has been seeing LGBTQ students wrestle with this,” she explained. “What does this mean for them? And can they still be here? I really want them to know that there are still plenty of people on campus who are affirming of their identity and their relationships. But I also feel like my CV, like having worked at Calvin for 13 years, is starting to become a sort of a liability in the field of social work. I think that there may be some assumptions about who I am and what I think about same-sex relationships ― things that aren’t true. And so I feel like I need to be on the record in some way.” Last week, Venema revealed her plans in an email to colleagues. She has decided to leave. One other question I asked Toly was about prospective students who identify as queer. What advice would he give them about attending Calvin? He was unequivocal: He said he hoped that they would come, that they would feel like they would be loved. He noted that the rules against intimacy outside of marriage apply equally to students of all sexual orientations. Asking for celibacy might seem like a lot, he acknowledged, but college is just four years. “We all at various points in our lives join communities or institutions that have rules or norms we wouldn’t make ourselves,” Toly said. “We often find ourselves submitting to those rules or norms, for a season at least.” I put the same questions to the students and alumni I interviewed, including those who now identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The responses varied, with some saying it was worth coming to Calvin in order to push it in a more progressive direction and others saying the difficulties were simply too great. Sweda said she would advise queer students to go to secular colleges, although she says some don’t have that choice because their parents won’t pay tuition if they don’t attend Christian schools. “The point a lot of people miss is that, for a lot of queer students... there is some sort of financial or family coercion going on there.” Sweda has actually set up a GoFundMe, which she says she uses to help LGBTQ Calvin students while on campus. A very real possibility is that Calvin could evolve over the next few years so that it has fewer students like Sweda and fewer professors like Kuilema, creating a campus and academic environment both more aligned with CRC teachings and more insulated from the culture around it. Universities like Bob Jones, Liberty and Oral Roberts offer a possible glimpse of that future. They have never had Calvin’s reputation for intellectual diversity. And although those schools have LGBTQ students, over the years many have spoken about the shame and stigma they feel, even instances of abuse, while experts and advocates worry about the toll on the students’ mental health. This was the biggest concern I heard over and over again from former staff who worked with LGBTQ students ― their fears for students struggling with issues of identity and sexual orientation, maybe for the first time and perhaps without sympathetic families. “There’s no such thing as just giving a philosophical and theological message like this without affecting someone’s well-being, because people internalize it,” said Kelsey Colburn, who was coordinator of student success and sexuality programming from 2019 to 2021. “If you’re telling queer young people … that [they] shouldn’t be able to be in relationships, then they end up wrestling with that themselves internally and thinking maybe I’m not OK, maybe there’s something wrong with me, maybe God doesn’t want me this way. And that can lead to severe mental health problems. I’ve seen it.” As for Kuilema, he has a wife, a toddler and two baby twins. For all of the recent discussion about morality and student well-being, Scripture and institutional integrity, Kuilema is still a working parent with bills to pay. When I called him last week, he was on the job market, looking for a faculty position at another institution. I asked him how he was feeling, given that Calvin has been part of his life for as long as he can remember, and whether he now wished he had made a different decision about the wedding. He admitted to some emotional ups and downs, likening them to the process of a grieving cycle, but added, “I strongly believe that it was the right thing to do, that it was consistent with everything that I believe. I wish we had been able to find a way to work it out, but I don’t regret officiating at all.” A few days later he was back at Calvin for a protest against the Synod vote. He brought his kids, calling it a “family tradition.” Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost"

The mob was ready to “tear Pence limb from limb,” former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman noted on MSNBC Saturday. It was “as dark as it gets,” added Litman, who called it a “set up” by Trump. Litman angrily responded to a chilling video of Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, in which one can be heard saying that “Pence just caved,” before adding that “we’re going to drag motherf**kers through the streets.” Trump already knew by then that Pence had decided he would not aid his effort to overturn the 2020 election, noted Litman. Yet Trump still indicated to his supporters before they breached the Capitol that Pence could be pressured into rejecting the electoral votes. “Trump goes out to the crowd and pretends ... it’s all up to Pence,” Litman emphasized. “He knows that Pence has already decided, but keeping it open like that is designed to induce the murderous rage in the crowd when they do find out,” Litman added. Once Trump’s supporters discovered Pence was not going to reject the electoral votes cast for Joe Biden in key states, the crowd became “absolutely inflamed,” he continued. “We have testimony ... that it was no joke,” Litman said, referring to the hearings of the House select committee investigating the insurrection. “They were ready to tear him [Pence] limb from limb. So Trump plays this dishonestly in such a way to rev the crowd up to its maximum level of violence. Really sinister,” he added. Check out Litman’s interview in the video below.

He was uninjured. “I’m good,” Biden told reporters after Secret Service agents quickly helped him up. “I got my foot caught.” Trump’s fake video, posted Saturday on his Truth Social account, shows footage of Trump hitting a golf ball spliced together with doctored footage of Biden’s bike mishap, with a golf ball flying into his head.

3,George Conway: Trump Incriminated Himself In 'Illegal' Election Plot Yet Again,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump continues to very publicly admit he was involved in an “illegal” scheme to overturn the election, conservative attorney George Conway said Saturday. In a two-hour speech at the “Faith and Freedom” conference on Friday, Trump talked at length about pressuring Mike Pence to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021. “I said to Mike, ‘If you do this, you can be Thomas Jefferson,’” Trump told the crowd. “And then after it all went down, I looked at him one day and I said, ‘Mike, I hate to say this, but you’re no Thomas Jefferson.’” It was Trump’s first speech since a series of riveting hearings by the House select committee investigating last year’s insurrection. “From a prosecutor’s standpoint, let him keep talking,” Conway told host Katie Phang on MSNBC. “He basically is still admitting that he put pressure on [former Vice President] Mike Pence to do something that was completely illegal.” “Somebody should tell him that he has the right to remain silent and anything he says can and will be used against him in a court of law,” added Conway, husband of former Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. Trump also said he would “very, very seriously” consider granting pardons to defendants who stormed the Capitol if he’s reelected. That could be seen as an attempt at “witness tampering” if he had that power now, said Conway. That’s what he “did a few years ago ... dangling pardons to people,” Conway noted. Trump also complained in his speech that those arrested after the insurrection are “having their lives totally destroyed and being treated worse than terrorists and murderers.” He called the violence at the Capitol a “simple protest” that got out of hand, and falsely claimed that “most” rioters have been charged with nothing more than “parading through the Capitol.” The defendants have actually been charged with assault — including causing serious bodily injury to police officers — as well as destruction of property, theft, conspiracy, seditious conspiracy and trespassing, among other offenses, according to the Department of Justice. Rioters at the Capitol caused nearly $3 million in losses, including property damage, and some 140 police officers were injured in the violence. More than 840 people have been arrested. Conway also discussed Trump’s “willful blindness” about the illegality of scheming to overturn a legitimate presidential election. “He understood, but he didn’t care,” said Conway.

4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

7,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer.

9,Newt Gingrich's Kamala Harris Insult Barrage Might Be Beneath Even Him,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Far-right pot-stirrer Newt Gingrich mocked Vice President Kamala Harris’ qualifications to be president on Fox News Tuesday.

The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

10,Tucker Carlson Cries 'Insurrection' After Colbert Production Crew Arrested Near Capitol,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Several crew members filming a comedy segment in an office building near the U.S. Capitol for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” were charged with unlawful entry earlier this week, leading prominent Republicans including Fox News host Tucker Carlson to falsely cry “insurrection.” “Last night, producers from Stephen Colbert’s show on CBS committed insurrection at the United States Capitol,” Carlson falsely claimed on his show Friday night. Carlson was referring to the arrest of seven production crew members for Colbert’s CBS show Thursday night, which was filming a segment at the Longworth House Office Building with Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, a crass puppet voiced by comedian Robert Smigel. Capitol police said Friday that the arrests happened after the building had been closed to visitors and the crew had already been told to leave the building. Colbert’s team had finished up prearranged interviews with lawmakers and were filming “final comedy elements” in the building’s hallways when the arrests took place, CBS news said in a statement. All seven crew members were slapped with unlawful entry charges. The arrests quickly became fodder for Republicans looking to distract from this week’s hearings on the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack by falsely equating the arrests of the crew members to the violence of former President Donald Trump’s supporters. “It’s exactly like what happened on Jan 6., so we’ll take a close look at what the punishments are,” Carlson told his viewers Friday night. He’s wrong. In the case of Jan. 6, five people died and more than 140 officers were injured after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory. In the case of Colbert’s crew, they were arrested filming a comedy segment featuring a puppet best known for hurting people’s feelings. And there were hurt feelings. Congresswoman and QAnon supporter Marjorie Taylor Greene took a photo of comedian Smigel with his puppet and posted it to Twitter to whine about “targeted harassment.” “Now all of you engaged in insurrection & enabled targeted harassment against me and my Republican colleagues,” Greene tweeted. “I’m telling the full story next week.” Disinformation merchant and Pizzagate peddler Mike Cernovich echoed a similar talking point on Twitter. “If they aren’t charged criminally the same as J6 defendants, then more evidence of selective prosecution arises,” Cernovich said in a tweet. “Judges can only rig stuff so much before the judiciary loses all legitimacy. Throw the book at these trespassers.” And Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) took the opportunity to compare Colbert’s production crew being in the Capitol to a tour Loudermilk gave to Jan. 6 participants one day before the violence ensued. “So while they’re accusing me of giving illegal tours of the Capitol, they are giving illegal tours of the Capitol,” Loudermilk said, accusing Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of allowing the production crew access. The difference, of course, is that comedian Smigel was armed with a microphone, and one of the men Loudermilk gave a tour to was later seen marching on the Capitol, filming an accomplice who was armed with a spear while making targeted threats against lawmakers. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly said the crew members were arrested inside the U.S. Capitol. They were arrested in a building that is part of the U.S. Capitol complex.

12,Jan. 6 Witnesses Push Trump Faithful Deeper Down Rabbit Hole,politics," One by one, several of Donald Trump’s former top advisers have told a special House committee investigating his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection that they didn’t believe his lies about the 2020 election, and that the former president knew he lost to Joe Biden. But instead of convincing Trump’s most stalwart supporters, testimony from former attorney general Bill Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka about the election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol is prompting many of them to simply reassert their views that the former president was correct in his false claim of victory. Barr’s testimony that Trump was repeatedly told there was no election fraud? He was paid off by a voting machine company, according to one false claim that went viral this week. Ivanka Trump saying she didn’t believe Trump either? It’s all part of Trump’s grand plan to confuse his enemies and save America. The claims again demonstrate how deeply rooted Trump’s false narrative about the election has become. “It’s cognitive dissonance,” said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a Syracuse University professor who has studied how Trump used social media and advertising to mobilize his base. “If you believe what Trump says, and now Bill Barr and Trump’s own daughter are saying these other things, it creates a crack, and people have to fill it.” The lawmakers leading the hearings into the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol said one of their goals is to show how Trump repeatedly lied to his supporters in an effort to hold onto power and subvert American democracy. “President Trump invested millions of dollars of campaign funds purposely spreading false information, running ads he knew were false, and convincing millions of Americans that the election was corrupt and he was the true president,” said Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the panel’s vice chair. “As you will see, this misinformation campaign provoked the violence on January 6th.” For those who accept Trump’s baseless claims, Barr’s testimony was especially jarring. In his interview with investigators, he detailed Trump’s many absurd allegations about the election 2020, calling them “bogus” and “idiotic.” Barr told the committee when he talked with Trump, “there was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.” “He’s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff,” Barr said. Following his testimony, many Trump supporters using sites like Reddit, GETTR and Telegram blasted Barr as a turncoat and noted that he’s disputed Trump’s election claims before. But many others began grasping for alternative explanations for this testimony. “I’m still hoping Barr is playing a role,” one poster said on a Telegram channel popular with Trump supporters. One post that spread widely this week suggested Barr was paid by Dominion Voting Systems, a company targeted by Trump and his supporters with baseless claims of vote rigging. “From 2009 to 2018, DOMINION PAID BARR $1.2 million in cash and granted him another $1.1 million in stock awards, according to SEC filings. (No wonder Barr can’t find any voter fraud!),” the post read. Wrong Dominion. Barr was paid by Dominion Energy, a publicly traded company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, that provides power and heat to customers in several mid-Atlantic states. Unlike Barr, Ivanka Trump has remained intensely popular with many Trump supporters and is seen by many as her father’s potential successor. That may be why so many had to find an an alternative explanation for why she told Congress she didn’t accept her father’s claims. Jordan Sather, a leading proponent of the QAnon theory, claims both Barr and Ivanka Trump lied during their testimony on Trump’s orders, part of an elaborate scheme to defeat Trump’s enemies by confusing Congress and the American public. “I can just imagine Donald Trump telling Ivanka: ’Hey, go to this hearing, say these things. Screw with their heads,’” Sather said last week on his online show. Some Trump supporters dismissed Ivanka Trump’s testimony entirely by questioning whether any of it was real. That’s another common refrain seen on far-right message boards. Many posters say they don’t even believe the hearings are happening, but are a Hollywood production starring stand-ins for the former president’s daughter and others. “She looks different in a big way,” one poster asked on Telegram. “CGI?” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Jan. 6 Panel Sends Letter Asking Ginni Thomas To Testify,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol has asked Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, for an interview, the panel’s chairman said Thursday afternoon. Thomas, a conservative activist, communicated with people in President Donald Trump’s orbit ahead of the attack and also on the day of the insurrection, when hundreds of Trump’s supporters violently stormed the Capitol and interrupted the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “We have sent Ms. Thomas a letter, asking her to come and talk to the committee,” Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the panel, told reporters after a three-hour public hearing Thursday. He didn’t specify a time or date for an interview. The chairman said her name could also come up at some point in the panel’s hearings that are being held throughout June. Earlier in the day, Thompson and committee vice-chair Liz Cheney had both said it was time for her to come in voluntarily and provide testimony with the nine-member panel after investigators discovered information that refers to Thomas — known as Ginni — in communications they have obtained relating to one of Trump’s lawyers, John Eastman. In response, Thomas told the conservative news site Daily Caller on Thursday that she “can’t wait to clear up misconceptions,” suggesting she would comply with a request to testify. Eastman, who was advising Trump in the weeks and days ahead of the attack, was a central figure in the committee’s third public hearing Thursday. Lawmakers laid out their case regarding the pressure campaign Trump waged, with a legal assist from Eastman, against then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to get him to object or delay Biden’s certification on Jan. 6. On his blog Thursday, Eastman posted a single email from Thomas on Dec. 4, 2020, in which she asks Eastman for a status update for a group she describes as “grassroots state leaders.” “OMG, Mrs. Thomas asked me to give an update about election litigation to her group. Stop the Presses!” the headline on the blog post reads. Eastman also said he never discussed with either Thomas “any matters pending or likely to come before the Court.” Thomas did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. It is not the first time members of the panel have said they want to talk to Thomas. In March, lawmakers on the committee said they were considering inviting her for a witness interview about text messages with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on the day of the attack. But she still has not spoken to the panel. She has been critical of the Jan. 6 committee and signed a letter with other conservatives calling on House Republicans to expel Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois from the GOP conference for joining the panel. Thomas also urged Republican lawmakers in Arizona to choose their own slate of electors after the 2020 election, arguing that results giving Joe Biden a victory in the state were marred by fraud. She has acknowledged she attended the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally on the Ellipse but left before Trump spoke and his supporters later stormed the Capitol. Justice Thomas was the only member of the Supreme Court who voted against the court’s order allowing the Jan. 6 committee to obtain Trump records that were held by the National Archives and Records Administration. The court voted in January to allow the committee to get the documents. The court on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the justice.

14,The GOP's 'Groomer' Panic Is A Green Light For Fascists To Attack LGTBQ People,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost At a Republican fundraiser in Stateline, Idaho, a local GOP official named Dan Bell was excited to introduce the next speaker. “He’s definitely not OK with trans or any of that gay shit,” Bell, youth chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee, said into the microphone as the crowd laughed. “Please give it up for Dave Reilly!” Reilly took the stage that day, April 16, to cheers. “A big round of applause for our Sheriff Norris, who keeps us safe!” Reilly said, pointing to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris in the crowd, according to video footage obtained by HuffPost. Reilly is a white nationalist who recently moved to Idaho and aims to take over the state political system from the ground up. In the crowd with the sheriff was a mix of fellow white nationalists, along with Proud Boys, militiamen and a far-right bike gang. Over the ensuing two months, what bound this group together was a deep ire toward LGBTQ people and a desire to stop a Pride event in nearby Coeur D’Alene on June 11. With the blessing of local Republican officials and using the same rhetoric as many GOP politicians nationwide, this far-right coalition churned out propaganda falsely labeling Pride as a haven for “groomers” and “pedophiles.” Participants also issued warnings to would-be Pride attendees: We’ll be there to confront you, and we’ll be armed. And they were. Bigots turned out in big numbers to harass and intimidate their queer neighbors. A U-Haul truck full of masked men from the white supremacist group Patriot Front turned up ready to storm the Pride event, but they were stopped by police and arrested on charges of conspiring to riot, sparking a wave of national headlines. All 31 men have now been identified and charged with conspiracy to riot. Democratic state Rep. Chris Mathias has suggested prosecutors pursue harsher felony charges under a state terror statute. On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to consider federal charges under the Anti-Riot Act. “It appears these people did not come here to engage in peaceful events,” Norris told a local reporter. The sheriff protected the Pride event from far-right antagonists and got to take some credit for the shocking bust that unmasked 31 white supremacists (a local hotel worker had tipped off his office after seeing them pile into the truck). But there’s also little accounting for Norris’ connections to the very far-right coalition that made Coeur D’Alene Pride a target. Patriot Front needs to be understood as a part of the militant wing of the Republican Party’s revanchist campaign to erase trans people from public life and push queer people back into the closet. When the right uses eliminationist rhetoric about LBGTQ people, it can’t then feign shock when straight-up fascists show up to support its cause. This last year has seen Republican politicians and right-wing media influencers across the country stir up a moral panic about the LGBTQ community being “groomers” — a term for manipulating children to make them vulnerable to sexual abuse. A wave of anti-LGBTQ laws, like Florida’s “Don’t say gay” bill, has swept the nation. This type of rhetoric and legislation has inspired far-right groups to confront and harass queer people in America at an accelerating rate that experts fear could soon mean more violence. And it’s no coincidence this particular group chose Idaho. It was one of the first states to pass anti-trans laws related to state documents and youth sports, and moreover, it has been ground zero for a far-right effort to take power by the ballot box. Eric Ward, director of the Western States Center, a Portland, Oregon-based civil rights organization that monitors right-wing extremists, said in a statement this week that “Idaho is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country may be headed in terms of how anti-democracy groups try to build power.” Norris, the Kootenai County Sheriff, did not respond to a request for comment on why he lent the imprimatur of his office to the gathering of bigots and extremists at Cruisers Bar & Grill back in April. Carl Bjerke, a retired firefighter from California who recently won the local GOP primary for Idaho state Senate — which, in a conservative place like North Idaho, means he’s all but guaranteed to win the general election — was photographed at the event. He also didn’t respond to a request for comment about his attendance. Neither did Bell, the event’s organizer and youth chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee — an organization that’s part of the Christian nationalist insurgency across Idaho. The headliner for the occasion was Bryson Gray, a MAGA rapper who recently released a homophobic song called “Pride Month” that includes the lyrics: “If a man would kiss another man, he’ll prolly kiss a child / Saying this was normal ten years ago, now it’s not allowed / I’m saying what other people think but I say it loud / How you a happy degenerate? Reprobate and proud.” In a music video for the song, Gray can be seen lighting a rainbow Pride flag on fire. During his trip to north Idaho, Gray was photographed with a pair of white nationalist figures who have been welcomed with open arms into the region’s Republican circles over the past year: Reilly, who moved to Idaho recently from Pennsylvania, and Vincent James Foxx, who moved from California. Reilly and Foxx, both of whom have extensive histories of extremism, have been at the center of the anti-LGBTQ push in North Idaho, and their propaganda has often received a boost from national right-wing media influencers. Back in December, according to a video obtained by HuffPost, Reilly spoke at a library board hearing in Post Falls, Idaho, where he lives. Holding his baby in his arms, Reilly — who has said “every Jew is dangerous” and who marched at the deadly 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — took to the podium to speak in favor of removing LGBTQ-related content from the library. “It’s not about censorship, it’s about them promoting a gay agenda and corrupting our children,” Reilly said. “These people are perverts and they are trying to pervert our children. Either we say no and tell them to go somewhere where they are welcome — like Portland or Seattle or LA or San Francisco. Get out of our community!” Some in the crowd jeered, but more cheered for Reilly — who was endorsed by the local Republican committee in an unsuccessful bid for a school board seat last year. “Idaho is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country may be headed in terms of how anti-democracy groups try to build power.” A few months later, in mid-April, Reilly and Foxx turned their attention to the upcoming Pride event in Coeur D’Alene. “Groomers are going to try and gather in the park in June,” Foxx alerted his 95,000 followers on Gab, the fascist-friendly social media platform. By mid-May, Foxx was delighted to see that other far-right groups in the area were now aware of Pride. “The Panhandle Patriots and several other groups plan to protest the ‘Pride in the Park’ event in Coeur d’Alene on June 11th,” Foxx wrote on Telegram for his 40,000 followers on that platform. “God bless Idaho!” Foxx linked to a video showing Panhandle Patriots “sergeant at arms” Jeff White speaking at an event hosted by Republican state Rep. Heather Scott. “We are having an event the very same day,” White said of Pride. “That very same day we actually intend to go head to head with these people. A line has to be drawn in the sand. Good people need to stand up. And she [Scott] was talking about the repercussions. We say, damn the repercussions. Stand up, take it to the head. Go to the fight.” After facing some negative media backlash over the remarks, Panhandle Patriots — which is known to turn up to political events with guns — issued a statement claiming their counter-demonstration at Pride would be “peaceful” but added: “We implore the Christian community to come together and show these LGBT groomers that North Idaho stands firmly against their sick agenda and that God still rules in the Panhandle.” In late May, Reilly seized on the fact that one of the slated Coeur D’Alene “Pride in the Park” vendors was The Satanic Temple. A little online research shows the Satanic Temple is a secular organization that does not actually believe in the deity of Satan, but uses him as a mascot to critique religious fundamentalism. “The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy, eject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense, oppose injustice, and undertake noble pursuits,” the group’s website states. But in Reilly’s hysterical rendering, the group was a cabal of evil “satanists” conspiring with degenerate queers to groom kids. “The Satanic Temple Announcing Attendance at Coeur d’Alene’s “Pride in the Park” — All Ages Event to Host Drag Queen Show for Idaho Children,” read a headline on the Idaho Tribune, a junk news website masquerading as a legitimate news source that, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is run by the same person that runs Reilly’s campaign website. The Idaho Tribune’s stories about Coeur D’Alene Pride got a boost from viral right-wing Twitter accounts, most notably LibsOfTikTok, the one-million follower behemoth run by a Brooklyn real estate agent named Chaya Raichik. In the weeks leading up to Pride, Raichik used LibsOfTikTok — which is now funded by conservative activist and entrepreneur Seth Dillon — to spread fear over drag queen performances and other LGBT+ events. Reilly encouraged Raichik on Twitter to post about Coeur D’Alene, and she repeatedly obliged. Extremism reporter David Neiwert notes that Raichik was “apparently in such close contact with Reilly that one of LibOfTikTok’s tweets promoted a Tribune story about 20 minutes after it was published.” The Satanic Temple eventually pulled out of the event. By June 11, extremists across America knew about “Pride in the Park” in Coeur D’Alene. Some men carried AR-15s. Others wore neo-Nazi skull masks while holding a “Groomers Are Not Welcome in Idaho” banner. And other men, according to a dispatch from Neiwert, held signs “citing the Leviticus verse that recommends homosexuals be put to death.” And then there were Reilly and Foxx, who led a couple dozen Christian nationalists in prayer near “Pride in the Park.” The far right already had a menacing presence at the Pride event when, at around 2 p.m., the U-Haul truck arrived. Police threw open the back door, revealing masked white men packed in like sardines, their hands up. Of the 31 Patriot Front members arrested, only two were from Idaho. A handful of them were from just across the state border in Spokane, Washington. The rest hailed from a dozen states, including Texas, home of the group’s 23-year-old, cowboy-hat-wearing leader, Thomas Rousseau. Rousseau and Reilly both marched at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi associated with a group called Vanguard America drove his car through a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. Rousseau was a member of Vanguard America, which dissolved after the attack. He formed the Patriot Front in its ashes, organizing chapters across the country. Over the last couple of years, he’s led the group in a nationwide hate crime spree, destroying dozens of Black Lives Matter murals and symbols across the country, according to a HuffPost investigation earlier this year. A video obtained by the independent media collective Unicorn Riot also showed Patriot Front members burning a rainbow Pride flag during a ceremony in the woods. “To those who destroy our nation, we will destroy your symbols and all that you worship,” one of the members says in the video. “If you think we will lay down and perish, you are gravely mistaken.” Patriot Front members, like hooded Ku Klux Klan members in the 1920s, often keep their membership in the group a secret, so the 31 arrests on June 11 in Coeur D’Alene amounted to a mass-doxxing event. As the Patriot Front members sat in the grass, hands zip-tied behind their backs, most wouldn’t talk to police, according to a report from the Coeur D’Alene Press. But Wesley Van Horn of Lexington, Alabama, allegedly did. When a police officer remarked that Van Horn had “traveled a long way for his cause,” Van Horn replied, “We go where we’re needed.” Clarification: Language has been edited to clarify the location of the photos taken of Bryson Gray; to clarify Dave Reilly’s relationship to the Idaho Tribune; and to clarify that The Satanic Temple was scheduled to be a vendor at the Pride event, not a sponsor.

15,Trump 'Handed Down Death Sentence To Mike Pence' To Stay In Power: Mary Trump,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump “handed down a death sentence to Mike Pence ” because he knew “the only way to get what he wanted” was for the “worst possible events to unfold” during the insurrection, according to his niece, Mary Trump. “We need to be very blunt about what happened,” she told Katie Phang on MSNBC Friday. Trump “wasn’t just stirring up his insurrectionists to create chaos,” she said. “He handed down a death sentence to Mike Pence.” Trump said that once Pence defied the former president and refused to overturn the election, her uncle had few options left to stay in power, and may have considered something as “absolutely radical” as “declaring martial law,” which witnesses have indicated. The “death of his vice president” could have paved the way for that, she noted. Trump told Lawrence O’Donnell the previous day on MSNBC that Trump’s vision for the insurrection took a particularly dark turn when he finally realized that someone “as weak and sycophantic as Mike Pence” had the “audacity” to go against him. That’s something “Donald isn’t going to take,” Trump said. “What people need to understand is that Donald doesn’t believe he should be denied anything he wants.” That’s when the former president knew “the only way for him to get what he wanted was for the worst possible events to unfold in the Capitol,” she said. The violent mob that stormed the Capitol was calling to hang Mike Pence that day and came as close as 40 feet from him. Despite the dire peril Pence was subjected to by his boss and his likely “abject terror,” Mary Trump does not consider the former vice president a hero for certifying the electoral vote despite the then-president’s demands. “Mike Pence is not a hero. He did the right thing on January 6th but only after exploring every way to avoid doing so,” she tweeted Thursday. “He doesn’t even have the guts to testify in front of the committee.” Mike Pence is not a hero.

Just one thing: He’ll have to do it under oath, in a witness chair, says Swalwell. Or, as he said in a tweet Thursday, “Equal time means sitting your lying ass in a witness chair.

1,Rants By Herschel Walker's Son On Absent Fathers Go Viral At Awkward Moment,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Wild rants by Herschel Walker’s son about absentee fathers are going viral on Twitter just as his Republican Senate candidate dad is trying to explain how he has a few other children the public didn’t know about. While Christian Walker, 22, has been angrily preaching to fathers to “control your thing” on TikTok videos, his dad has admitted he has two other sons and a daughter with other mothers. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner and former NFL star who’s been endorsed by Donald Trump in his campaign against Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), has often spoken out publicly against children being raised in fatherless households, which he has called a “major, major problem.” “Get home and raise your kids!” says an angry Christian Walker in one of his video messages early this week, targeting “Wild N’ Out” host Nick Cannon. “And take care of the women you’re knocking up! Can you control your thing for three seconds?” He had a similar eruption weeks ago on the same topic. “Fathers, it would be great if you stayed home and raised your kids instead of ran off to bang a bunch of women who weren’t your baby mama. Stay home and raise your frickin’ kids!” he said. “Your kids need a father! Get back home!” Christian Walker railing against deadbeat dads, and Nick Cannon specifically, as “everything wrong” w/ America on TikTok five days ago“Get home and raise your kids!

Can you control your thing for three seconds??” pic.twitter.com/2ol553f0LS Another Christian Walker vid from a few weeks ago: “Fathers, it would be great if you stayed home and raised your kids instead of ran off to bang a bunch of women who weren’t your baby mama. Stay home and raise your frickin kids! Your kids need a father! Get back home!” pic.twitter.com/PBI8keA3Ky On Wednesday, Herschel Walker’s campaign confirmed a report in The Daily Beast that he has a 10-year-old son with a woman from whom he’s estranged. He fathered the child “years ago when he wasn’t married,” campaign manager Scott Paradise said in a statement to HuffPost. The Beast reported that the child’s mother, who has not been publicly identified, sued Walker after giving birth to secure a declaration of paternity and child support from Walker, who has limited contact with his youngest son. After his campaign confirmed the 10-year-old son, Walker, 60, then said Thursday that he also has a 13-year-old son and an adult daughter, who was born when Walker was about 20, after it was reported in The Daily Beast. “I have four children: Three sons and a daughter. They’re not ‘undisclosed’ — they’re my kids. I support them all and love them all,” Walker said in a statement to HuffPost. Walker told HuffPost that he “chose not to use them as props to win a political campaign” — though Christian Walker has appeared at events with his father.

2,Gov. Gavin Newsom Joins Truth Social To Call Out 'Republican Lies',politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has joined Donald Trump and his GOP allies on Truth Social, where he’ll be “calling out Republican lies,” he announced Thursday. “This could get ... interesting,” he quipped. In a tongue-in-cheek comment, he greets followers in his first video post on the social media platform with: “Hey, everybody, it’s Gov. Gavin Newsom, and I know we’re all on this platform in search for the truth.” He then points out that eight of the 10 states with the highest crime rates in the nation are Republican-led states. “The truth is, I’ve not been able to find a simple explanation for the fact that we have a red state murder problem,” Newsom said. “So the question is simple: What are the laws and policies in those states that are leading to such carnage?” he added. I just joined Trump’s Truth Social.Going to be on there calling out Republican lies. This could get…interesting.My first post -- breaking down America’s red state murder problem. https://t.co/5IxSCf4XJY pic.twitter.com/RnEaKNwpaF Former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), now the CEO of Truth Social, welcomed Newsom. “We’re happy to have him,” he told Fox Business, even though Nunes said he doesn’t agree with him “on anything.” He insisted Truth Social was designed to be an “open platform” regardless of political affiliation. But though Truth Social has claimed to be a free-speech advocate and enemy of censorship, the operation has developed an overwhelmingly conservative, predictable perspective that highlights Trump’s relentless posts. The site often features gushing praise of Trump and posts few negative reactions to his comments. Trump said the quiet part out loud earlier this year when he told Fox News that Truth Social was intended to be a “platform for my voice.” He added: “Truth is a platform for my voice and for my supporters.” “The key question raised by the launch of Truth Social is how impactful can a social media platform be if its user base is, to some extent, politically homogeneous?” Phil Napoli, a Duke public policy professor, told Yahoo Finance earlier this year. A one-note voice tends to shut down opportunities for debate that could actually draw users, Napoli noted. Truth Social reported in a filing last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had no paid advertisers. Its parent, Trump Media & Technology Group, is losing money and “expects to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future,” the filing said. Truth Social came under fire last week when several users’ accounts were reportedly suspended after they mentioned the dramatic televised hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Nunes called users’ reports “fake news.” But several users posted screen shots of Truth Social suspending their accounts, which they said occurred immediately after posting about the hearings.

3,'Cowboys For Trump' Founder Avoids More Jail Time For Joining Jan. 6 Mob,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — An elected official who was a central figure in a New Mexico county’s refusal to certify recent election results based on debunked conspiracy theories about voting machines avoided more jail time on Friday for joining the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol. Couy Griffin, who founded the political group Cowboys for Trump, was sentenced to 14 days imprisonment. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden gave Griffin credit for the 20 days he already served in jail after his arrest. Federal prosecutors and a probation officer had both recommended a sentence of three months imprisonment. Griffin faced a maximum prison sentence of one year for his misdemeanor conviction. After a trial without a jury, McFadden convicted Griffin in March of entering a restricted area outside the Capitol during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, but acquitted him of a disorderly conduct charge. Griffin didn’t go into the building itself and wasn’t accused of engaging in any violence or destruction. McFadden, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, also ordered Griffin to pay a $3,000 fine and $500 in restitution and perform 60 hours of community service. The punishment for Griffin’s role in the riot that delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory and sent lawmakers running for their lives came the same day Griffin’s Republican-dominated county commission faced a deadline to certify its election results. Otero County commissioners opted 2-1 to certify the results during an emergency meeting Friday. Griffin alone refused to certify, joining the meeting remotely hours after his sentencing in Washington. The two who voted to certify said they had no choice under state law and could be only a rubber stamp. They also acknowledged an order by the state Supreme Court and subsequent threats of legal action by the Democratic state attorney general. While there has been no evidence of fraud, the actions by the commission had threatened to disenfranchise more than 7,300 voters in the politically conservative area of southern New Mexico. During his sentencing, Griffin claimed the commission “found major discrepancies” in an election audit. He didn’t elaborate but said, “That’s all we want, is transparency and truth.” McFadden said he didn’t factor that situation into his sentencing of Griffin. But the judge said public officials like Griffin must be held to a higher standard. “We need our elected officials to support this country,” McFadden said. During the riot, Griffin shouted his unsubstantiated belief that the election was stolen from Trump, climbed a toppled fence and another barrier to access the Capitol steps and used a bullhorn to lead the throngs in prayer. Griffin told McFadden that he only went to the Capitol to pray with others. “My actions on Jan. 6 were the result of my faith,” he said. McFadden said the Capitol riot was a “national embarrassment” and called it “preposterous” for Griffin to claim that he didn’t know he couldn’t be on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6. “I’m not convinced, even a little bit,” the judge said. A day after the Capitol siege, Griffin made a social media video expressing his intention to return to Washington and talking about the prospect of holding a gun rights rally on the Capitol steps, saying “there’s gonna be blood running out of that building.” “But at the end of the day, you mark my word, we will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Donald J. Trump if it boils down to it,” Griffin said. At least 21 riot defendants have pleaded guilty to a single count of the same misdemeanor charge that Griffin was convicted of by the judge. Judges handed down prison sentences ranging from 10 days to three months in 14 of those cases, according to an AP review of court records. Prosecutors said Griffin has shown a lack of contrition for his actions during the attack. Griffin bragged at a county commission meeting about violating orders from police to stay out of the restricted area, has spread conspiracy theories about what happened on Jan. 6 and has made social media posts that questioned the conclusions of the judge overseeing his case, prosecutors said. Defense attorney Nicholas Smith maintained Griffin is remorseful and believes he received a fair trial. But the judge said Griffin’s lack of contrition and apparent disdain for the criminal justice system is “very concerning.” Griffin is one of the few riot defendants who isn’t accused of entering the Capitol building or engaging in any violent or destructive behavior. More than 800 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot. Over 300 of them have pleaded guilty and nearly 200 have been sentenced. _____ Billeaud reported from Phoenix.

4,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

9,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Trump Says He'll 'Look Very Seriously' At Pardoning Jan. 6 Defendants If Reelected,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump said Friday that he would look “very, very seriously” at pardoning his supporters who were charged in last year’s violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol if he’s elected president again. Trump complained at a speech in Nashville, Tennessee, that people who were arrested after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were “having their lives totally destroyed and being treated worse than terrorists and murderers.” He added: “If I become president someday, if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons. Very, very seriously. They’ve been treated very unfairly.” Trump hasn’t yet declared he’s running for the presidency. He also falsely claimed that “most” of those arrested for the events of Jan. 6 were charged with nothing more than “parading through the Capitol.” There is no such “parading” charge. The defendants have in fact been charged with assault — including causing serious bodily injury to police officers — as well as destruction of property, theft, conspiracy, seditious conspiracy and trespassing, among other offenses, according to the Department of Justice. More than 840 people have been arrested. Rioters at the Capitol caused nearly $3 million in losses, including property damage, and some 140 police officers were injured in the violence. Trump indicates he will pardon the January 6 defendants if he becomes POTUS again pic.twitter.com/Ho5kF6Ayl6 Trump’s comments follow three televised hearings by the House select committee investigating the insurrection. The committee has revealed how Trump and his allies threatened to topple the democratic system — and how near former Vice President Mike Pence came to an angry mob that called for his hanging because he had refused Trump’s orders to reject the 2020 election results. Staunch Trump supporter Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said earlier this year that a prior call by Trump to pardon the insurrectionists was “inappropriate,” leading Trump to angrily attack Graham as a “RINO” (Republican in name only). “Lindsey Graham doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about,” Trump said. The former president reiterated his position in his Nashville speech that Pence should have followed his orders and upended the election to keep Trump in the Oval Office. “I never called Mike Pence a wimp,” he said, denying testimony at the hearing. “I never called him a wimp. Mike Pence had a chance to be great … I say it sadly, because I like him, but Mike did not have the courage to act.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,It Suddenly Doesn’t Seem Like Californians Rejected Criminal Justice Reformers,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost With only a fraction of the votes counted in California’s low-turnout, off-year primary elections, The New York Times confidently declared last Wednesday What It All Meant: voters had rejected progressives and their vision of criminal justice reform in favor of tough-on-crime candidates. “Election results in San Francisco and Los Angeles were the latest signs of a restless Democratic electorate that remains deeply unsatisfied and concerned about public safety,” the subhed of the Times’ story read, referring to the recall of San Francisco’s progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin and the early lead of billionaire Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso. Heiress Nellie Bowles, the descendant of a California land baron, took it a step further, claiming that San Francisco had become a “failed city” under progressive leaders because they failed to sufficiently criminalize poverty and drug addiction. The San Francisco district attorney recall, a well-funded campaign that began before Boudin took office in California’s 12th most populous county, was never a good proxy for statewide sentiment. Although Boudin’s ouster is a blow to the progressive prosecutor movement, it is not necessarily indicative of broad rejection of his policies, which are more popular than he is. “With more mail-in ballots counted, the notion that California voters had resoundingly embraced a more carceral approach to governance started to fall apart.” And by the following week, with more mail-in ballots counted, the notion that California voters had resoundingly embraced a more carceral approach to governance started to fall apart. This wasn’t surprising in a state where every registered voter receives a mail-in ballot. People who vote by mail tend to lean progressive and because they have until Election Day to put their ballot in the mail, many of their votes will not be counted until days or even weeks later. County election officials have until July 8 to report official results to the Secretary of State. In Los Angeles, the state’s most populous county, Caruso is now in second place, behind the more progressive Karen Bass, despite spending $39 million of his own fortune. Caruso, a longtime Republican who recently became a Democrat, campaigned on hiring an additional 1,500 police officers to the country’s most lethal law enforcement agency and forcibly removing people from homeless encampments. Although Bass also called for a much more modest increase to LAPD staffing, she promised to fund programs to help people find jobs, housing, food and transportation, warning, “Los Angeles cannot arrest its way out of crime.” Under California’s top-two primary system, Caruso and Bass will compete in a runoff election in November. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who oversees a law enforcement agency overrun with deputy gangs, currently has less than 32% of the vote, leaving him vulnerable in the runoff if his challengers unite behind a single candidate. Villanueva unexpectedly ousted the incumbent sheriff in 2018 by portraying himself as a progressive, but once in office he worked to cover up misconduct within his agency, pushed a recall of reformist District Attorney George Gascón, and railed against the “woke left.” Although several of Villanueva’s eight challengers have positioned themselves as reform-minded, many activists remain skeptical and have been wary of throwing their weight behind anything other than getting rid of Villanueva. Two Los Angeles City Council candidates who both received endorsements from the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter are currently leading their races. Abolitionist organizer Eunisses Hernandez — who has worked to close a Los Angeles jail, remove California’s sentencing enhancements for drugs, and allocate taxpayer money to alternatives to incarceration — is narrowly ahead of incumbent Gil Cedillo with 50.65% of the vote compared to his 49.35%. Labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martinez, who called for an end to “traumatizing” sweeps of homeless encampments “that waste millions of dollars pushing people from block to block” is nearly five percentage points ahead of incumbent Mitch O’Farrell, who oversaw last year’s forced removal of unhoused people from Echo Park. Kenneth Mejia, a 31-year-old CPA and housing-justice activist who ran billboards illustrating how little Los Angeles spends on combating homelessness compared to policing, is 16 percentage points ahead of veteran politician Paul Koretz in the city Controller race. And a slate of public defenders and a civil rights lawyer running for judgeships are on track to make it to November’s runoff. Outside of Los Angeles, other races are complicating the picture of a state desperate for more punitive elected officials. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is on track to easily keep his job, despite a challenge from tough-on-crime Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert. Schubert, who ran as an independent, has failed to crack 10% of the vote. In Contra Costa County, about 40 miles east of San Francisco, voters reelected District Attorney Diana Becton, who is part of a progressive prosecutor alliance with Boudin. Becton, the county’s first prosecutor to bring felony charges against a law enforcement officer for an on-duty shooting, won her primary outright by receiving more than 50% of the votes, staving off a challenge from a colleague backed by law enforcement unions. In Alameda County, home to Oakland, voters ousted Sheriff Gregory Ahern, who oversaw the county’s deadly jail, cooperated with ICE on deportations and platformed the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia. Ahern lost to Yesenia Sanchez, a sheriff’s commander who has called for alternatives to jail for people with mental illness and reducing the use of solitary confinement. Ballots are still being counted and the results of close races could still change. With statewide turnout hovering around 29%, progressives who fared well in the top-two primary could still lose in the general election as candidates consolidate and more voters show up. But with the information currently available, handwringing takes about a crime-terrorized electorate desperate for law and order just don’t hold up.

12,Twitter Users Mock Peter Navarro's Desire To Postpone Trial Because Of Book Tour,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost No one can say Peter Navarro doesn’t have his priorities, but that doesn’t mean people can’t laugh at them. After Donald Trump’s former trade adviser pleaded not guilty to two contempt of Congress charges on Friday, he tried to delay the start of the trial until next year. His reason? So he could promote his new book, “Taking Back Trump’s America: Why We Lost the White House and How We’ll Win it Back.” Ironically, Navarro’s book discusses the Jan. 6 insurrection ― the same topic that he refused to discuss with the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol — hence the contempt charges. Federal prosecutors considered Navarro’s argument about his book tour to be a “clearly unwarrented” delaying tactic. “The government has serious concerns about the postponement of the trial for a book tour,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Vaughn said, according to The Daily Beast. “The public has a stake in the resolution of this case.” U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta apparently agreed, tentatively setting a Nov. 17 trial date. Many Twitter users lacked sympathy for Navarro’s plight, especially since his book discusses many of the things he refused to talk about under oath. But what about my book tour, your honor? https://t.co/kDCdKrneUl via @TPM LOL, Navarro's lawyers say he can't go on trial later in the year because he'll be on book tour.The book is on the topics he refused to discuss with the committee citing executive privilege. Oh dude, no, that's not an excuse. https://t.co/XYoLXvBWKX Hearing this live in court is like a slow-rolling comedy sketch. https://t.co/7ENkCWQse5 One person wondered if a delay in Navarro’s trial would have provided even more evidence-gathering possibilities.

13,Peter Navarro Pleads Not Guilty To Contempt Of Congress,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost A former White House adviser to Donald Trump pleaded not guilty Friday to two contempt of Congress charges stemming from his refusal to provide documents and testimony to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Peter Navarro, Trump’s former trade adviser, was charged earlier this month with one count of contempt for failing to appear for a deposition before the House committee and with a second count for failing to produce documents the committee requested. The committee asked for Navarro’s documents and testimony to help piece together what took place in the days surrounding the Jan. 6 attack that left five people dead and more than 140 police officers injured. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in the District of Columbia set a trial date for November. Though Navarro declined to cooperate with the House committee, the former Trump aide has made several television appearances and wrote a book about his time in the White House. Navarro was arrested earlier this month at an airport while trying to board a flight to Nashville, Tennessee, for another TV appearance. “Who are these people? This is not America,” Navarro said during his initial court appearance. “I was a distinguished public servant for four years!” Navarro is the second Trump aide to face criminal charges for defying the House panel. Former White House adviser Steven Bannon was indicted last fall for refusing to comply with a House subpoena. Bannon’s case is set for trial next month after a judge denied his motion to dismiss the charges. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Montana Gov. Spent Days Vacationing In Italy As His State Suffered Historic Flooding,politics," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte was nowhere to be found this week, as his state was devastated by historic flooding. The flooding, triggered by torrential rain and rapid snowmelt, devastated communities across southwest Montana. Swollen rivers washed away bridges, buildings and entire roads in and around Yellowstone National Park, stranded tourists and polluted drinking water in many communities. The National Park Service shuttered all of Yellowstone, and northern areas of the park are expected to remain closed for months — dealing what is likely to be a devastating blow to the economies of gateway communities like Gardiner, which were hard-hit during the early part of the pandemic when tourism ground to a halt. But for days, Gianforte’s office refused to disclose the governor’s whereabouts, citing “security reasons.” It acknowledged in statements to local reporters that he’d left the country last week, before the floods, on a “long-scheduled personal trip with the first lady,” and said he was returning home “early and as quickly as possible.” Around the state capitol in Helena, rumors swirled that the governor was in Africa, likely on safari, according to a Twitter post from Max Croes, a longtime Democratic campaign manager and staffer based in Helena. Maritsa Georgiou, a correspondent for Newsy based in Missoula, ultimately discovered that the governor and his wife were vacationing in Tuscany, the ritzy region of central Italy. Newsy obtained a photo from an anonymous source that showed the couple dining at a restaurant in the village Casole d’Elsa. The picture was reportedly taken 12 minutes after Gianforte’s office sent out its statement about the governor returning to Montana “as quickly as possible.” Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office says he will be back in Montana tonight. They say they do not share his location when he's out of the country for security reasons. @Newsy has obtained a time stamped photo that shows he's been in the Tuscany region of Italy. #mtnews #mtpol The incident quickly earned Gianforte comparisons to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who famously fled to Cancun, Mexico, last year as his state was reeling from winter storms and widespread power outages. Gianforte’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Friday morning. But in a statement to local press, it finally confirmed his whereabouts. “With the governor back in the state and security concerns no longer an issue, we are providing information as promised,” Brooke Stroyke, a spokeswoman for the governor, wrote. “The governor departed early Saturday morning to Italy with his wife for a long-planned personal, private trip.” His office has never detailed what “security concerns” were at play, or why it took several days for him to return. Stroyke noted Gianforte had delegated his authority to Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras, who signed a statewide emergency declaration in the governor’s absence. She said the two “worked closely over the last four days to take swift, decisive action.” Gianforte is scheduled to visit Gardiner, located at the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park, on Friday to survey damage, according to his office. Gov. Gianforte was in Italy, his office confirms Friday morning. The governor left Saturday for a personal trip to Italy and returned last night. He will be in Gardiner today for a tour and briefing. #mtnews #mtpol #MTFloods #YellowstoneFloods pic.twitter.com/4PUXF0atfx While Gianforte was in Italy, Montana National Guard soldiers were rescuing dozens of his constituents from floodwaters. A team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, was on the ground assessing flood damage. And President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for the state. When Cruz escaped winter storm-ravaged Texas for sunny Mexico last year, conservatives flocked to his defense with absurd justifications, including that he would have had nothing to offer Texans and was “not using up valuable resources of energy, food and water.” Montana Republicans have similarly come to Gianforte’s defense. “Regardless of where he was, he was communicating with the people on the ground to make sure that the issues were being addressed,” Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) told Fox News. Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Bill Pascrell calls on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to resign over new reporting about Ginni Thomas.""Clarence Thomas cannot possibly be seen as a neutral actor but instead as a corrupt jurist who has poisoned the High Court."" pic.twitter.com/NnvMOUDd3e Clarence Thomas did not recuse himself from cases relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and was the lone vote of dissent in a case over claims of executive privilege by Trump and his aides, including onetime chief of staff Mark Meadows, involving documents sought by the House committee investigating the Capitol riot. The House Jan. 6 committee said Thursday it will now be seeking to interview Ginni Thomas after reviewing emails she had exchanged with John Eastman, a lawyer advising Trump on his efforts to challenge the results of the election. While the content of the emails remains unknown, sources told The Washington Post the letters show a more significant involvement than previously known. “We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee,” Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said, according to a tweet by Axios reporter Andrew Solender. Ginni Thomas herself said she would welcome the request, telling The Daily Caller Thursday: “I can’t wait to clear up misconceptions. I look forward to talking to them.” The committee is already in possession of text messages Thomas sent to Meadows calling on Trump not to concede the election. “It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back,” Thomas wrote to Meadows on Nov. 6, 2020.

16,Iowa Supreme Court: Abortion Not Protected By State Constitution,politics," DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for lawmakers to severely limit or even ban abortion in the state, reversing a decision by the court just four years ago that guaranteed the right to the procedure under the Iowa Constitution. The court, now composed almost entirely of Republican appointees, concluded that a less conservative court wrongly decided that abortion is among the fundamental privacy rights guaranteed by the Iowa Constitution and federal law. Friday’s ruling comes amid expectations that the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Then Iowa lawmakers could ban abortion in the state without completing the lengthy process of amending the state constitution. The Iowa decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by abortion providers who challenged a 2020 law that required a 24-hour waiting period before a woman could get an abortion. A judge who struck down the law cited the state high court’s 2018 ruling. The judge also concluded the law violated rules prohibiting passage of bills with more than one subject. The state Supreme Court returned the waiting period case to district court. In its 2018 ruling, decided by a 5-2 vote, the court said that “autonomy and dominion over one’s body go to the very heart of what it means to be free.” The reversal of a decision after just four years reflects a dramatic change in the court’s makeup. Gov. Kim Reynolds has named four justices since 2017, so six of the seven people on the court have been appointed by Republican governors. Reynolds, an outspoken opponent of abortion rights, and Republicans in the Legislature have repeatedly said they hoped the court would overturn the 2018 ruling. With that in mind, Reynolds and GOP lawmakers gave the governor more control over the panel that chooses which lawyers and judges are nominated for court positions.

1,Court Refuses To Dismiss Dominion's $1.6 Billion Defamation Lawsuit Against Newsmax,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost A Delaware judge on Thursday denied Newsmax’s motion to dismiss a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems alleging the network’s reporting about the voting software company following the 2020 election was false. Judge Eric M. Davis of the Superior Court of Delaware ruled Dominion at this stage has a case for defamation and allowed the company’s suit to advance. “The Complaint supports the reasonable inference that Newsmax either knew its statements about Dominion’s role in the election fraud were false or had a high degree of awareness that they were false,” Davis wrote in his decision. The judge also said Newsmax continued pushing election fraud claims, even though the network “knew the allegations were probably false.” “Newsmax possessed countervailing evidence of election fraud from the Department of Justice, election experts, and Dominion at the time it had been making its statements,” the judge wrote. Dominion sued Newsmax Media Inc. on Aug. 9, 2021, for $1.6 billion, arguing the right-wing media company deliberately made false statements about the 2020 presidential election and Dominion’s voting machines. On the same day, Dominion filed two additional defamation lawsuits against One America News Network and former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne. Newsmax told HuffPost it was “not surprised” by Thursday’s ruling. The same judge ruled in December 2021 that Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News could proceed. “We are not surprised by the judge’s decision as this was a preliminary motion and he made a very similar ruling in the Fox News case,” the company said in a statement. “Newsmax reported on both sides in the election dispute without making any claim about the results other than saying they were ‘legal and final.’” “We are confident that Newsmax will ultimately prevail given the strong First Amendment protections provided to ensure free speech and a free press,” the statement continued.

2,Joe Biden Hosts Climate Meeting Amid High Gas Price Pressure,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden, who has recently been focused on boosting oil production to reduce rising gasoline costs, turned his attention to climate change on Friday when he convened a virtual meeting of some of the world’s biggest economies. Among the participants are China, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Also present is Egypt, which is hosting the next United Nations summit on climate change, and the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres. Biden reiterated his goal to lower gasoline prices that are averaging a record $5 a gallon in the U.S. while also shifting away from fossil fuels in order to limit climate change and the risks it presents. “I’m using every lever available to me to bring down prices for the American people,” Biden said. “But the critical point is that these actions are part of our transition to a clean and secure and long-term energy future.” The conference is known as the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, and it began under President Barack Obama in 2009. Among the priorities are slashing methane leaks and getting more zero-emission vehicles on the roads. Biden administration officials, insisting on anonymity to discuss the event, said they expect some of the countries to announce more ambitious climate targets as part of the landmark agreement reached in Paris in 2015. Biden sounded the alarm on extreme weather events in an Oval Office interview on Thursday with The Associated Press. “We have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding,” he said. “People saw what — I took my kids years ago to Yellowstone Park. They call me, ‘Daddy did you see what happened at Yellowstone, right?’ Well, it’s unthinkable. These are 1,000-year kinds of events.” But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has scrambled Biden’s climate goals by driving up the cost of gas. Facing political pressure to get prices under control in a midterm election year, the Democratic president has urged U.S. oil refiners to produce more fuel even as companies say they lack the long-term incentives to do so because the administration is accelerating the move to clean energy. “Well, I say in the short term, do the right thing,” Biden said Thursday, stressing his view that energy companies should increase production instead of trying to maximize their profits. Biden is also expected to visit Saudi Arabia next month. The White House recently praised the kingdom after OPEC+ announced that it would pump more oil to boost the global supply.

3,Mike Lindell Fumes Over Cancel Culture After Walmart Drops MyPillow,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Mike Lindell accused Walmart of canceling him after the retail giant removed MyPillow products from its shelves. Lindell, the MyPillow founder and a loud supporter of Donald Trump who backs his election lies and got sued for it, said he told a Walmart executive: “You guys are just canceling us.” The far-right conspiracy theorist was told his pillows were no longer rated high enough, The Daily Beast reported on Thursday. Lindell told the outlet the executive smirked at him, prompting the bedding mogul to slam his laptop shut and basically end the meeting. He blamed “cancel culture” for Walmart’s decision. Lindell, who recently caused a stir in Wyoming by declaring that state’s 2020 results rigged despite a landslide victory for Trump there, told Steve Bannon in a livestream that Walmart’s exclusion will result in a ”$10 million hit” for his Minnesota-based bedding company, The Hill reported. Walmart told The Hill that while it no longer stocks Lindell’s goods in brick-and-mortar stores, “MyPillow products continue to be available on Walmart.com.” Other retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond, Wayfair and Kohl’s, quit selling MyPillow products in January 2021 following the Capitol riot.

Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said. You can watch the moment Muir cuts Christie off below.

8,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

9,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
10,From Movement To Mayhem: Inside The ACLU’s Post-Trump Reckoning,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost On April 6, Anthony Romero, the longtime executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, joined a Zoom call with several dozen employees. He was there to eat crow. The mood on the call was testy. The employees belonged to the ACLU’s national political advocacy department, a relatively recent addition to the 102-year-old civil liberties organization. Romero, who has led the ACLU since 2001, had made the department central to his ambitions to transform the ACLU from a legal powerhouse into a full-scale electoral and grassroots movement for civil rights. But a series of internal shake-ups and disastrous choices by leadership had led to the steady attrition of staff and a feeling of despondency among many who remained. There were people on the call who had been exhorting Romero to take action for months, if not years. Romero had finally fired the head of the department, Ronald Newman, just a few weeks earlier. On the call, Romero told the employees he cared deeply about them and their work. “How we play a policy and political game has never been more essential for the work and for the future of this organization,” he said, in the deliberate, paternalistic cadence that is his signature. “I’m really grateful and appreciative that you’ve decided to make the world a better place by deploying your energies, your talents, your dreams, your aspirations here.” “I know, being frank, some of you don’t trust me,” he concluded. “I’m just asking: Give us a chance, because we’re trying to do this differently.” In fact, the ACLU had been trying to do things differently for years. Over the past decade, it has been Romero’s goal to build the organization — which has historically done most of its fighting in the courtroom — into one that wields as much political and cultural clout for civil rights as the National Rifle Association does for the gun lobby. Romero had even commissioned a study, in 2013, of what made the NRA so powerful. Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House put the ACLU’s ambitions on rocket boosters. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, millions of stricken Americans opened their wallets to the ACLU or joined its legions of volunteers, giving the organization both the mandate and the money to try to lead the anti-Trump resistance. But slapping rocket boosters on a century-old ship has consequences. “I’ve never seen a big, legacy liberal institution successfully pivot, and certainly not as quickly as the ACLU was trying to,” a former employee said. And six years later, the damage still shows. The advocacy department, which was supposed to seed political victories in cities and states across the country, has hemorrhaged staff. Its army of volunteers, which it spent millions to cultivate, is flagging. An organization-wide transformation that started with high energy, high-priced consultants and celebrity-studded launch parties has led to listening sessions, HR investigations and outside counsel. The pandemic and the summer of Black Lives Matter hit the ACLU like any other workplace, prompting employees who say they experienced racism and inequality at the country’s premier civil rights organization to declare: enough. This article is based on more than 30 interviews with former and current ACLU staffers and internal documents, emails, chat logs, recordings of meetings and legal filings that corroborate their accounts. Most current employees spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, while many former employees requested anonymity because they continue to work in civil rights and don’t want to jeopardize their relationship or their employer’s relationship with the ACLU. This turmoil is not unique to the ACLU. Nearly all progressive legacy institutions have undergone some kind of gnarly reckoning since 2016. The left writ large is suffering from grassroots malaise. As Sam Adler-Bell recently wrote in New York magazine: “After four years of fever-pitched marching and movement-building by anti-Trump resistors, antifascists, Democratic Socialists, and Black Lives Matter militants, the sudden quiet from the country’s left flank has been deafening. Where, I find myself asking, is the movement?” But the ACLU is a glimmering star in the progressive universe, with a history stretching back to the Scopes trial — long before most of these groups even existed. “This is an important inflection point: whether the mission is going to become more balanced, or whether we stay on the current course,” a current employee said. “I still want to believe we’ve got the chance to do it right.” None of this would have been possible without the “Trump bump.” Prior to 2016, the ACLU typically raised around $6 million a year from online, small-dollar donors. From the morning after Election Day 2016 to the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration 11 weeks later, the ACLU raised a whopping $40 million. The outpouring of support for the ACLU made sense: Where other groups in the progressive and civil rights spaces seemed to reel in the face of Trump’s election, the ACLU appeared to be battle-ready. Within hours of Trump signing the first Muslim ban, on Jan. 27, 2017, ACLU lawyers had joined the throngs of protesters at the nation’s major airports, where they were determined to stop deportations. The ACLU had its first client by 9 p.m. and filed its first lawsuit at 5:30 a.m. the next day. That night, as authorities tried to force their client onto a plane bound for Syria, ACLU attorneys persuaded a judge in Brooklyn to issue a nationwide stay of deportations under the Muslim ban. “When Anthony comes out of the courthouse at Cadman Plaza after a judge blocked the Muslim ban, you can see his eyes dart around in awe at the crowd,” a former staffer said. A huge protest had materialized outside the courthouse, one so large that Romero and an ACLU lawyer on the case could hardly get out the door. The crowd was chanting “A-C-L-U!” “I swear you can see it on the footage: the moment he realizes, ‘Oh shit. We could be a thing.’” To make these ambitions a reality, Romero selected Faiz Shakir, a former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Shakir would lead the National Political Advocacy Department, which predated Shakir but would now grow by leaps and bounds. (The week it helped defeat the Muslim ban, the ACLU had done record fundraising again, receiving the largest-ever influx of one-time gifts and new recurring donations, according to a 2020 internal document shared with HuffPost.) NPAD would grow to include dozens of staffers, run ballot measure campaigns, advance civil rights legislation at the state and local levels and, significantly, take a position in state and local elections. On the day after Trump’s inauguration, Shakir gave an “electric” speech to the staff, said Chris Anders, a longtime ACLU policy staffer. “It was the only staff meeting in my 25 years that was memorable,” Anders recalled. “He said, ‘We are not a public interest law firm, we are not a law firm protecting civil rights. What we are, and what we’re about, is building a movement. A movement for civil liberties and rights that will outlive and outlast us.’” The ACLU was not entirely new to electoral fights. During the Obama administration, the organization had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in public relations campaigns and ballot measures to legalize same-sex marriage. But there were thorny problems to solve if the ACLU was going to become a full-blown movement. No matter how much its mission had grown in recent years, the ACLU was still known first and foremost as the country’s premier legal advocate for civil liberties. Ira Glasser, Romero’s predecessor, led a group of critics who insisted that the organization could not uphold its core values — including, crucially, defending unpopular speech under the First Amendment — while simultaneously leading a political movement. “The Trump era calls us in particular to take our fight beyond the courtroom and to try to change the consciousness of the nation,” Shakir said in a recent interview with HuffPost. “You just don’t have many institutions that have 50-plus state affiliates, a footprint on the ground all across the country.” The ACLU was also a huge, bureaucratic institution with hundreds of national staffers and 53 state and local affiliates who were used to orienting their work primarily around lawsuits and the courts. What’s more, virtually every large progressive organization in the country was competing to tap into the power of the resistance. The ACLU’s entry into the organizing sweepstakes was called People Power. People Power sought to channel all of that energy into a lasting, nationwide grassroots network the ACLU could deploy to demonstrations and canvassing events. And the energy was genuine. An ACLU employee at the time recalled meeting a group of strangers who oohed like she was a celebrity when she told them she worked on People Power. Shakir brought in several veterans of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign as consultants to build up the ACLU’s digital organizing capabilities. In March 2017, Padma Lakshmi headlined a splashy kickoff event that the ACLU broadcast live to more than 200,000 people at 2,300 house parties. One of People Power’s first initiatives was to put grassroots pressure on police and sheriff’s departments to end the practice of turning over local residents who were undocumented to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Hundreds of ACLU volunteers protested at local jails and county board meetings, and many blue cities ultimately abandoned their ICE agreements. Its next major campaign was an awareness-raising effort for Amendment 4, a 2018 ballot initiative in Florida to restore voting rights for up to 1.4 million people with prior felony convictions. The measure passed. To Shakir and to some local activists, these were examples of how the ACLU could offer its superior clout and resources to vital local causes. But many local activists, and even the ACLU’s state and local affiliates, resented the national organization for swooping in at the last minute and taking credit. Immigrant rights groups had been protesting local ICE cooperation agreements for years. Amendment 4 was primarily the fruit of years of local organizing and canvassing led by the very people, formerly incarcerated Floridians, with the most at stake. But over time, the list of volunteers became more inactive, said one current and two former staffers, who blamed a lack of continuity in between campaigns. The ACLU offered ad hoc training for the mission of the day, such as making calls for the ACLU’s preferred candidates in local sheriff’s races in 2018 and 2020. But it put much less thought into how to keep a successful national organizing effort going, the employees claimed. “We did not stay in touch with those People Power groups,” one former employee said. “[We] did not invest in long-term organizing. We did not create a base of people who could respond to shit that’s happening in their own state ... We didn’t build any lasting power.” Several organizers hired by the ACLU after People Power launched felt there wasn’t enough for them to do by the time of the 2020 elections, and some quit. “I was getting the message that [organizing] was politically irrelevant,” another former employee said. “They wanted People Power to be this group of people we could pull in for one-off actions,” said the first former employee. But “volunteers will not keep volunteering with your organization if there’s not a relationship being built.” Today, the online bulletin board where the ACLU and People Power groups used to post information about rallies and trainings is mostly empty. Many People Power Facebook groups have gone dormant. The former and current in-house organizers agreed that most of those groups never became self-directed or developed lasting relationships with the ACLU’s local affiliates. They are less activist groups than they are email lists. The success stories, like Amendment 4, obscured how many wasted hours went into volunteer-focused initiatives that fizzled out, they said, especially once Ronnie Newman took over NPAD in spring 2019. The organization always expected some volunteers to become less active once Trump left office, Shakir said. While People Power may not exist in its original form, the ACLU’s work still benefits enormously from the work it did to recruit thousands of volunteers, said Kary Moss, the current interim leader of NPAD, and a senior NPAD staffer, both of whom the ACLU made available for questions. ACLU volunteers were essential to the organization’s efforts in 2018 and 2020 to elect several reformist candidates for local sheriff, they said. People Power made it possible to launch Rights for All, a campaign in which volunteers went to dozens of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders’ campaign events and got them on the record about the ACLU’s core issues. During the 2020 general election, the ACLU identified four counties in Georgia where mail-in voting was severely jeopardized by access issues and mail delays. The ACLU called on its volunteers to pack local online hearings and demand fixes from election officials, said the senior staffer, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly. In Michigan, where the ACLU is currently working to put a measure on the ballot that would prevent the state from banning abortion, more than 30,000 ACLU volunteers have raised their hands to gather signatures, said Moss. “Capacity-wise, prior to 2017 we couldn’t have done any of that,” the senior staffer said. NPAD had made it possible. Growing pains, hiring through your networks, bringing in your own people — these things happen in the C-suite of every organization. That is the view, today, of several of the higher-ups and Shakir acolytes brought in after 2016, who don’t see anything nefarious about hiring a lot of new and ambitious people to help the ACLU achieve new and ambitious things. “There was a lot of cleaning up broken glass while we were there, breaking things first and asking for forgiveness later,” said one of the newcomers. “And I think for the old guard, that got really old, really quickly.” There was also the matter of who was doing the cleaning up. Since 2016, the ACLU national staff has ballooned in headcount, from 323 to 544, and has grown more diverse, a spokesperson for the ACLU said. About half of the current staff and half of the current leadership identify as people of color. But turnover among people of color, especially among Black staff, was high during this period. The ACLU recently boasted, in response to a discrimination lawsuit that is still ongoing, that the attrition of Black staff had fallen from 2018 to 2021 by nearly half. “They had all these fancy ideas but a complete cultural disconnect from social justice conversations that had been going on around them.” Multiple former Black staffers said they got tired of covering for their white colleagues. “They had all these fancy ideas but a complete cultural disconnect from social justice conversations that had been going on around them,” said one, referring to the many young, white political professionals who flocked to the organization after 2016. “And I just remember having to explain really basic things to them.” By the time of the 2018 annual staff retreat, there was a nascent unionization effort afoot. (The staff won voluntary recognition in May 2021.) Members of the organizing committee slipped into conference rooms ahead of key panels and left leaflets on the seats highlighting racial disparities inside the ACLU. But the bigger conversation dominating the conference was about a virtual reality exhibit the ACLU was preparing for the ACLU100 Experience — a 14-city festival in 2019 that featured celebrity performances, guest lectures, music, live art and interactive exhibits to ring in the ACLU’s 100th anniversary. Designed at huge expense by an outside production company, the VR exhibit was staged inside an empty shipping container where attendees could virtually “experience” the United States’ brutal treatment of immigrants throughout history. In one scene, according to the recollections of those who saw it, you’re being searched at Ellis Island. In another, you’re a Japanese American child at an incarceration camp whose father has just been hauled out of sight. In the present day, you can hear children wailing or migrants screaming just beyond your cell. The staff revolted. “It was the definition of trauma porn,” one former staffer recalled. It was a “theme-parky” take on suffering, insulting to fellow activists who actually had been detained or imprisoned, and obviously designed to impress people who had not. “We were like, absolutely not, for so many reasons, we can’t do this,” another person said. The uproar caused the ACLU to kill the exhibit. But then a small group, which included a few Black staffers, became responsible for repurposing the shipping container with a fraction of the initial budget and timeline. They opted for decorating the container with portraits of migrants and audio recordings of each person telling their story. “As we do with many of our activities, staff got a preview of the exhibit in 2019 at our all staff conference before it went to the public,” said an ACLU spokesperson in written responses for this article. “In response to staff concerns, we redesigned the exhibit which received raves.” One team in particular that hemorrhaged people of color was the newly created analytics department. The team was led by Lucia Tian, who’d worked at McKinsey & Company for many years before she joined the 2016 Clinton campaign, where she was the No. 2 on the team that handled the campaign’s disastrous voter-targeting models. Tian had a more fruitful time at the ACLU, where, starting in 2018, she built out a modern analytics team that provided legal research, streamlined internal operations and gave executives the ability to have detailed donor and fundraising information at their fingertips. The team provided vital research for the ACLU’s lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, and for its fights for a fair redistricting process. But members of the team complained there was a clear pattern as to who thrived under Tian’s leadership and who didn’t. All three managers and the deputy she chose were young and white. And by the time she left, in early 2022, nearly every person of color who’d originally worked on the team had been fired or quit. A Latina data scientist with a Ph.D. and more than a decade of research experience joined the legal analytics team and wound up reporting to a white woman who lacked managerial experience and, by her own admission, had fewer technical skills than the data scientist. The data scientist found herself not only doing her own work but pointing out her manager’s errors — such as when the manager assigned a task to someone who didn’t have sufficient technical knowledge, or when the manager mistakenly left her out of key meetings with litigators. She was constantly afraid that the team would put out flawed work and give the ACLU’s opponents an opportunity to tear its evidence apart. And at the end of the day, her manager took home the credit, she later wrote in a legal declaration — and the higher salary. (Her manager declined to comment.) “Set up to fail”: That’s how multiple former employees in interviews and in legal declarations came to describe the way Tian positioned people of color on her team — particularly Black men. One had his direct reports reassigned; Tian demoted and fired another. By mid-2020, members of the team were sounding alarm bells about the lack of equity in hiring and promotions. Amber Hikes, who uses they/them pronouns, is the ACLU’s chief equity and inclusion officer, and mediated several disputes on Tian’s team. They told Sophie Kim Goldmacher, the head of HR, and Terence Dougherty, the ACLU’s general counsel and Tian’s supervisor, in no uncertain terms that Tian was not investing in her staffers of color the way she supported the advancement of her white staff, Hikes later told the data analyst. Tian and her deputies responded to complaints by acting hurt and defensive, former employees said in interviews and legal declarations. “Nothing has changed,” read an anonymous letter that eight members, or about three-quarters, of the analytics department sent to Dougherty and KP Trueblood, the ACLU’s chief of staff, in September 2020. “The team managers continue to center the feelings of white managers rather than the effects their actions have on BIPOC on the team.” The occasion for the letter was Tian’s decision to fire one of the team’s analysts, Robert Jackson, in August 2020. Jackson, who is Black, contended — at the time and, later, in a lawsuit against the ACLU and Tian — that his firing was related to the 2019 ACLU staff conference in Montgomery, Alabama. At the conference, an ACLU executive, Kary Moss, had snapped a group photo with former U.S. attorney general and civil rights arch-villain Jeff Sessions. Horrified, Jackson and several other Black men made a speech to some 150 ACLU employees demanding that the organization confront its own problems with systemic racism. The job for which Jackson was hired was not supposed to require a high degree of coding or technical capabilities, according to documents from a lawsuit Jackson later filed, interviews with his former co-workers, and a declaration from a former co-worker on his hiring committee. But when he returned from Alabama more vocal about workplace discrimination, in his telling and according to declarations from a former co-worker, Tian not only shut down those conversations, she began assigning him work requiring advanced technical skills for which he had not been hired. The ACLU and Tian, in their response to his lawsuit, argue roughly the opposite. They note that after Montgomery, Jackson wrote to Tian to say he felt “safe, welcome and honored” because she and the team had his back. They also say he wasn’t proficient in all the skills he listed on his resume, and they gave examples of Jackson blowing his deadlines. Tian demoted Jackson in January 2020, which slashed his salary, and fired him in August 2020. On his last day, Jackson sent a series of bittersweet and blistering notes to the entire national staff. “I have a ton of scars and trauma due to how I was managed, mismanaged, and ultimately handled,” he wrote. Tian, distraught, Slacked the analytics team and told them to read between the lines of Jackson’s farewell message for “untruths.” She said she was mainly sorry that dealing with Jackson had consumed so much of her time. Hearing Tian call their friend and former colleague a liar in so many words was the spark for the anonymous letter to Dougherty and Trueblood. Eight members of her team co-signed it, and six wrote out testimonials. “The undervaluing of BIPOC members of our team is a very real pattern that I wish you could recognize, address and take ownership over even if your intentions are good,” read one representative excerpt. “My assumption was — about the culture — it’s the ACLU. I’m a Black queer dude, I’m gonna be good, I’m gonna be myself. This place is different because it’s supposed to act like a beacon and a champion for people like me.” Tian tried to restore the team’s trust. Through a series of mediations, Tian, the team and Hikes agreed on ways to improve the team’s hiring and promotion practices. But the damage was done. Around this same time, the data scientist complained to HR and Hikes that Tian had not made her manager’s role open for anyone to apply. The ACLU brought in outside counsel who looked at her case in isolation and determined that the decision did not meet the legal standard for discrimination, because her manager’s promotion had already been in the works when she applied for the data scientist role. Hikes, though, told the data analyst that they’d emphasized to Dougherty and Goldmacher that they saw clear bias on the team. Hikes said they warned Dougherty and Goldmacher that if Tian weren’t held accountable, Tian, who is Asian American, might herself be the only person of color left in an otherwise all-white department. (Through the ACLU, Hikes, Dougherty and Goldmacher denied that Hikes said these things.) The Black man whose direct reports Tian had reassigned quit in late 2020, citing discrimination. “We’ve been significantly better at talking about it, but not at actually putting things into action,” he wrote in a goodbye email. The data scientist quit in late 2021. By then, she had received a promotion, but it materialized slowly and entailed less responsibility than she’d anticipated, she claimed in her legal declaration. Around the time she left, she wrote to the board of directors: “Among current and former employees, and in the circles in which they move, the reputation of the ACLU is already suffering.” Tian left too, in early 2022. In response to questions for this story, Tian referred HuffPost to the ACLU’s comments about Jackson’s retaliation and discrimination lawsuit, which he filed against her and the ACLU in 2021. The ACLU highlighted some of these changes in response to HuffPost’s questions about analytics, and said that several of them, like the more equitable hiring practices, apply to the whole organization. It has also invested in career advancement and talent retention with a focus on staffers from underrepresented backgrounds, said the ACLU spokesperson. “As we stated when the suit was filed,” the spokesperson said, “the organization brokers no tolerance for retaliation and discrimination, and we flatly reject the claims in the complaint.” Jackson says the whole experience still has him reeling. “My assumption was — about the culture — it’s the ACLU. I’m good, I’m a Black queer dude, I’m gonna be good, I’m gonna be myself,” he said in a recent interview with HuffPost. “This place is different because it’s supposed to act like a beacon and a champion for people like me, who look like me.” Occasionally, people in his network still ask him if they should apply to work there. “What am I supposed to say?” What stung most of all, members of the analytics team said, is that they knew better than anyone that the existential threats facing Black and brown communities were generating record off-cycle fundraising for the ACLU ― especially when those threats came from the Trump administration. The first “Trump bump” was small compared to the outpouring of donations when Trump signed the Muslim ban in January 2017. In June 2018, Trump’s family separation policy, and news footage of kids in cages, resulted in another huge spike in recurring donors. Nothing else came close until the “police brutality moment” of 2020 — which is how the data team tactfully referred to the five weeks of national protest following the murder of George Floyd that May. According to a slide deck shared with HuffPost, the ACLU raised $21 million in individual donations and added more recurring donors, 25,000, than in any previous crisis. (The ACLU told HuffPost the actual amounts were higher than that, but not a record. The ACLU also noted that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing and a rash of anti-abortion bills in 2019 resulted in fundraising moments; they are the smallest fundraising moments as measured by the analytics team.) A member of the analytics team made a slide deck analyzing the best strategies for getting these new, one-time donors to keep on giving money. The presentation described the police brutality moment as “uniquely valuable to the organization.” Romero declined to speak to HuffPost for this story, but sent a statement: The ACLU was fortunate to see an outpouring of support from millions of individuals to help fuel our fight against the Trump administration. This support allowed us to expand our fight across multiple fronts including at the grassroots level and expand the tools to do this work which included investing in people, technology and analytics. With the Supreme Court on the cusp of rolling back a right to an abortion which has existed for nearly 50 years, it’s increasingly clear that we can’t put all our eggs in the litigation basket, and the initiatives and experiments of the last several years will serve to fuel new types of advocacy in the years to come. In January 2019, Shakir left NPAD to become campaign manager for Sanders’ second run for president. Romero named Newman as Shakir’s successor that spring. People recalled he was well-liked, smart and clear-eyed about the country’s state of emergency. Newman was a veteran of Barack Obama’s State Department and National Security Council, where he worked on refugee protection. He’d been overseeing NPAD’s budding electoral work, including its early experiments in electing reformist sheriff candidates. Current and former staffers say Newman came up with a narrow, unrealistic standard for what kinds of campaigns NPAD ought to run. He demanded high-impact work, but he mainly wanted to launch campaigns that could succeed within a year. He focused on victories at the state and local levels, but he often resisted working with the state affiliates on their existing priorities, or adopting their strategic approaches, if they differed from his own. He loathed what he saw as excessive deliberation. He had little interest in influencing Congress, or even, after Joe Biden’s election, influencing federal policymakers. And even though roughly half of all states were under Republican control, he was disinterested in defeating bad policy, and laser-focused on playing offense, the staffers said. “Ronnie had way too much emphasis on fights that could be won this year as opposed to fights that are tough but that, whether you win or lose, you can build power and make it more likely that the next item around, you can make it a win,” said an ACLU employee who works closely with members of Newman’s team. If it was going to take lawmakers more than one legislative cycle to pass a bill — if, for example, some lawmakers were skittish about crossing a powerful lobby, but you could get a bill out of committee as a proof of concept one year, and pass it the next — that was usually a nonstarter, current and former staffers said. Early on in Newman’s tenure, a police killing in a solid blue state was putting pressure on policymakers to pass a first-of-its-kind accountability measure. Newman initially balked at joining the pressure campaign, in part because he felt the killing had taken place too long ago — it had been barely a year — to guarantee the momentum would keep going. Major issues started to fade from the NPAD portfolio. Defensive work on behalf of AMEMSA communities ― that is, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim and South Asian ― fell by the wayside, according to a former employee and complaints raised by employees in meetings with Newman. When Biden was inaugurated, NPAD had no comprehensive plan to lobby the administration on its core issues. “To be really honest with you, I’m not proud of the work we were doing,” said one current staffer. “I don’t think it was tremendously impactful.” Few teams struggled with Newman’s definition of success more than the reproductive justice team. Around the time Newman became head of NPAD, a major donor asked Romero what the ACLU was doing about the Republican assault on abortion rights. So Newman asked his staff to tee up a major win, and quickly. The problem was, it is nearly impossible to restore decades of lost abortion access in a single motion. There were virtually no states where it would be possible to flip a few legislative seats or the governor’s mansion for the Democrats in order to build a total firewall against abortion restrictions; the GOP’s power ran too deep. A ballot measure that established the right to abortion could result in the judiciary overturning restrictions that were already on the books, but only if such a measure were coupled with legal action. That entailed both too many steps for Newman’s liking and not enough credit for his department. “No one has a silver bullet on how to win on reproductive rights where it really matters,” one former staffer said. “And he didn’t understand that.” The team and Newman went back and forth for months. He dismissed some potential campaigns out of hand because he didn’t believe they could win over the median voter, or because he personally approved of certain abortion restrictions, such as laws requiring parental notification or approval before a minor has an abortion. Newman, for his part, was furious at what he saw as the team’s fatalism and lack of creativity. Longtime members of the team were used to working with attorneys, and would offer long, legalistic explanations without necessarily making a confident recommendation. Eventually, in late 2019, Newman came around to the idea of supporting a ballot measure in Michigan to establish a constitutional right to abortion. But now the team faced the challenge of getting Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Michigan on board before the deadline to make the 2020 ballot. Both organizations were nervous about how the ballot question might affect a swing state in a presidential election year, and whether it would pass. When the team asked Newman to make the case to local partners, he fumed and swore. For unclear reasons, the project was put on ice. “Look, he’s not an idiot, he knows what he’s doing. We can’t just throw money at whatever Planned Parenthood tells us to,” a former employee said in an interview. “He just went way too far in the other direction, trying to be a total cowboy ... He gives not two shits about collaborativeness or the ability to bring people along.” Newman’s strategic choices might not have resulted in a full-blown attrition crisis if they weren’t coupled with the way he treated the staff. He once said he was a fan of forcing prospective hires to quote their own salary to keep salaries low, and that if a new hire would work for peanuts, he didn’t see what use it was to pay them more. Many of those who worked for Newman believe that he was harsher toward those belonging to or working on behalf of minority communities, the LGBTQ community and the reproductive justice movement. When those employees pitched new campaigns, according to more than half a dozen people who worked for him and emails they supplied, Newman’s default response was to be skeptical if not outright derisive. (“The advocacy team that works on reproductive freedom within NPAD is one of the most constant teams within the department,” the ACLU spokesperson said.) By early 2020, a group of NPAD staffers were raising alarms over the steady attrition of women of color. Goldmacher, the head of HR, reassured the department in a February 2020 meeting that many employees were leaving for better opportunities, or to go back to school. But the staff knew that the toxic atmosphere at NPAD was what drove them to look for other jobs in the first place. “The baseline opinion is he was kind of a jerk,” said the employee who works closely with members of Newman’s team. “And the question is whether he was more of a jerk to some people than to others.” Two moments from early 2020 stood out as examples. On both occasions, employees were raising concerns to Newman that the department was hardly doing any advocacy for AMEMSA communities. In one instance, Newman dismissed those concerns with a joke, several people recalled — something along the lines of, “You got me! I hate Muslims.” Weeks later, at a large meeting between Newman, his staff and HR — this one concerning NPAD’s attrition problem — a young woman many times his junior recalled how his joke had made her feel like shit. Newman responded not by apologizing, but by picking apart her recollection in front of her horrified colleagues. The moment was classic Newman, people said. Yes, it was his prerogative to pick and choose campaigns — but he didn’t need to embarrass the woman. NPAD no longer has anyone focused on AMEMSA advocacy, although the ACLU continues to work on issues affecting the AMEMSA community, the spokesperson said. By late 2020, NPAD staffers had started demanding that ACLU leadership take action. Members of the ACLU’s board had noticed tweets from staffers that alluded to the department’s low morale. Romero had no choice but to intervene. “Anthony doesn’t ever, ever, ever want to be pulled into organizational drama, ever, at all,” a former employee said. Perhaps that explains why Romero’s first attempt to help sounded so hostile. It was October 2020, and the NPAD staff were gathered on a Zoom call. Romero, in his usual deliberate meter, started out on a reassuring note. “I am definitely aware of some of the issues that a bunch of you are raising,” he said. “I am not an absentee landlord who comes around just to collect the rent once a month. I am deeply engaged.” As a next step, he was inviting as many staffers as possible to talk to him one-on-one about what needed to change at NPAD. But he implicitly warned the staff against taking up too much of his valuable time. “You know, it’s year-end, I bring in a bunch of money at the year-end. You want me to keep my donor appointments, right? Because that’s what helps pay the salaries, the rent.” He also reminded the staff that he’d endured a leadership challenge before. In the mid-2000s, he survived a knock-down, drag-out fight with the ACLU’s board and a vote of no confidence that took place on his birthday. They could go and read about it in The New York Times. It was an odd, discordant address. Romero closed by repeating his offer to talk one-on-one but cautioning that he had once reduced an NPAD manager to tears. (She was on the call; he mentioned her by name.) “I’m direct,” he said. “I’ve always been. ‘Frank as you are ugly,’ as my grandmother would say to me,” he said, repeating one of his favorite aphorisms. That was his my-door-is-always-open message. That was his offer to help. “Some of you will be disappointed by any plan that doesn’t encompass leadership change. While I heard those suggestions, I rejected them in the end.” More than two dozen members of the NPAD staff met with him anyway. After those conversations, as HuffPost previously reported, Romero sent the staff a jarring memo in which he acknowledged the substance of their complaints — the attrition, the low morale and the lack of long-term thinking — while redoubling his support for Newman. “Some of you will be disappointed by any plan that doesn’t encompass leadership change,” Romero wrote. “While I heard those suggestions, I rejected them in the end. Ronnie is enormously talented and I value him.” “For each of you individually, the hard question is: ‘Can I give this another shot and give it my best?’” he continued. “If the answer is honestly ‘no,’ then you owe it to yourself, the organization, and to your colleagues to be real and to make a change that allows you to engage at some other part of the ACLU or at another organization.” It read to almost everyone like an invitation to quit, which many did. By July 2021, at least 19 more members of the department, including all of the women in senior leadership, had left the ACLU, an employee said in a Zoom meeting between Newman, NPAD staff and the ACLU’s general counsel. Fourteen of those who left were women, 12 of them women of color. In the meeting, Dougherty, the general counsel, promised staff that the ACLU took their concerns about discrimination “incredibly seriously.” Newman, though, told his staff that their accusations of misogyny had no factual basis, and that he saw them as based on his race. (Newman is Black.) “I am not sure, exactly, what it is about me personally that seems to make the baseless assertions flow a bit more easily. But I do think we ought to be able to do a bit better,” he said. “Especially within a civil liberties organization.” He added that his wife didn’t think he was sexist. “As a Black man who is married to a Black woman — who is a force of nature, both personally and professionally — I don’t take that kindly to being alleged to be a misogynist,” he said. HuffPost emailed detailed questions about its reporting to Newman and followed up over the course of several weeks. He never responded. Newman’s defenders say the ACLU and its fellow legacy organizations have spent too long reacting to attacks on civil liberties, and that Newman was trying to lead them out of a losing cycle. He was obsessed with wins because he felt a moral urgency to offer real protections ― not “grad student lectures,” in the words of one of his defenders, a current ACLU employee ― to the country’s most vulnerable people. At Newman’s direction, the ACLU played a prominent role in persuading the Food and Drug Administration under Biden to lift restrictions on the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone — a genuine reproductive rights milestone. Those sheriff’s races Newman loved so much? The ACLU’s candidate usually won. As for that Michigan ballot measure, the ACLU, the ACLU of Michigan and Planned Parenthood Affiliates of Michigan are gathering signatures to place the Michigan Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative on the ballot later this year. “I enjoyed having him as a leader,” a current director at NPAD, who’d been hired by Newman, said in an interview. “I think he provided an enormous amount of guidance. I always felt respected in our disagreements.” Speaking of Newman’s standards and the work he asked them to perform, she said: “At no point had I ever felt it was unnecessary or uncalled for or unattainable or unsupported. I always felt there was an opportunity to have a larger conversation about the work if there were any disagreements.” “There’s a time and place for building power and building movements, and then there’s exercising the power you have today, to move the people who are in power today, in the world as it exists at this moment,” said the current ACLU staffer who believed in Newman’s vision. “To the extent that there has been attrition in the organization, it’s because Ronnie has expected accountability.” But the attrition didn’t stop. And so, in October 2021, the ACLU told staff it had hired an outside human resources consultant, Muriel Watkins, to conduct an investigation of NPAD. Romero later said the investigation was the result of three HR complaints received that August accusing Newman of sexism. Watkins interviewed more than 30 former and current staffers and surveyed almost two dozen others. She didn’t find that Newman targeted people because of their race or gender — notably, either conclusion could have opened up the ACLU to a discrimination lawsuit — but she acknowledged just about every other complaint: Newman’s poor leadership, his my-way-or-the-highway approach, the widespread belief that he reacted to criticism by “placing those who spoke up or spoke out into disfavor.” She gave Romero her final report on Jan. 24. On Feb. 17, Newman was abruptly fired. That week, the staff was in revolt over an op-ed by one of Newman’s deputies, Vikrum Aiyer, in which he called for enhanced policing in response to San Francisco’s homelessness crisis. HuffPost had also informed the ACLU that it was planning to report on Watkins’ investigation. “As with most organizations that aim to try something big and new, we didn’t always get things right, but we have built a stronger foundation learning from those growing pains,” Romero said in his statement to HuffPost. “This includes continuing to invest in our most precious resource ― our staff who are the most talented and passionate team I’ve worked with. We are all deeply committed to the approach that it’s the power of people who’ll bring about change.” Kary Moss, of the Jeff Sessions incident, is taking Newman’s place as the organization searches for a replacement. “We’re spending a lot of time working on culture,” she said, and making it possible for the team to pick long-term battles and go on the defense. Emphasizing the commitment to reproductive rights, she said the vast majority of the organizing team’s time right now is being spent fighting for the Michigan abortion rights ballot initiative. Staffers still trade theories about why Newman lasted as long as he did. One theory is that he was extremely good at courting donors, a skill Romero prizes highly. Romero habitually pushes for the children of major political donors to get ACLU internships or entry-level jobs. (“We would take issue with the uses of the term ‘habitually’ and ‘push,’” the ACLU spokesperson said. “As happens with many senior staff here and likely other places, Anthony passes along resumes he receives.”) Romero tacitly acknowledged many of Newman’s shortcomings in his mea culpa to the NPAD staff this April. “Write these down,” Romero said. The department’s new leadership was going to respect the staff’s expertise, repair relationships with local affiliates and activists and pursue long-term policy goals, not just short-term wins. “We want to play offense and defense on the key civil liberties and civil rights battles in the states and in Congress. Congress is important,” he said. “The federal government is important. We can’t abandon the most important player in the field for civil liberties and civil rights.” Later that afternoon, HR and the equity and diversity officer held a meeting with NPAD staffers, where anger mixed with relief. “It’s been three years of collective banging and yelling behind a locked door, but it feels like the bolt has been pulled back,” one staffer said in the Zoom chat. Another staffer asked a question that hung in the air: “For the folks that are no longer here, where is their restitution and their apology?” “I do appreciate the conversation and the transparency. I feel like this has been the most transparency we’ve had for a while,” this person continued. “But I do think that there has been a culture here where people pass the buck ... Once a person’s gone, or that person’s in the hot seat, they bear everything, [not] the people who also had the power and access and privilege to change, and who have said nothing.” Accountability, transparency — what did those concepts mean to the ACLU? the staffer asked. Were they just buzzwords? “Because we always do this to the world,” they said ― meaning, tell hard truths and ask hard questions. “But we have an issue doing it with each other.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said that KP Trueblood, not Sophie Kim Goldmacher, was among the people who denied that Amber Hikes had warned them about inequality in the analytics department.

11,The Coming War On Abortion Drugs,politics," Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. There’s a new war on drugs looming. But it won’t involve addictive narcotics or S.W.A.T. teams banging down doors. Instead, the approaching battle will be over medication that is safer than Tylenol and approved by the Food and Drug Administration: abortion drugs. Medication abortion is the most common method of abortion in the country, accounting for about 60% of all abortions in the U.S. Abortion drugs were approved by the FDA in 2000, and are safe, effective and widely prescribed for miscarriage and abortion care before the 10-week mark. If Roe v. Wade falls in the coming weeks, rolling back the constitutional right to abortion care, about half of the states will immediately ban or severely restrict abortion ― leaving a small patchwork of blue states to cover care for the rest of Americans. The country is staring down a historic moment that will irrevocably change the political and cultural face of the U.S. But medication abortion can ensure we don’t go back to the pre-Roe days of back-alley abortions and desperate women dying on tables in dingy motel rooms. Many people don’t know that abortions can now, in many cases, be done from the comfort of their home. And anti-choice lawmakers and other abortion opponents are banking on you not knowing about medication abortion. Many have already started explicitly attacking access to abortion pills: In the first three months of 2022 alone, more than 100 measures attempting to restrict medication abortion were introduced in red states across the country ― in addition to dozens of other extreme abortion restrictions that have gone into effect this year. “It’s critical to remember that medication abortion is incredibly safe, incredibly effective and in high demand ― and the states hostile to abortion rights know this,” said Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “That’s why they are trying to increase stigma around medication abortion… and create additional liability for those trying to access the pills.” With or without Roe, anti-choice lawmakers know the next chapter in abortion care will center on medication abortion. And they’re starting to quietly wage a war, hoping to cut off access to a safe and effective abortion method before most Americans even know about it. Medication abortion is a two-drug regimen ― one mifepristone pill, usually followed by four misoprostol pills ― that’s commonly used in the U.S. and around the world. Misoprostol alone can also be used to induce an abortion, and is widely used in countries outside of the U.S., but only a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol has FDA approval. When used together, they are more than 95% effective. Misoprostol used alone is also extremely safe, but only about 80% to 85% effective. “For the longest time, everyone’s imagined abortion in a pre-Roe way ― a physical procedure that you must have,” said Christine Matthews, a veteran pollster who focuses on gender and voting. “Most voters don’t know that about half of abortions these days are done with pills.” Some experts argue that the lack of common knowledge around medication abortion is by design, and overregulation has deliberately stifled the full potential of abortion pills in the U.S. In some countries, both mifepristone and misoprostol are available over the counter. In others, just misoprostol is available at pharmacies. Neither drug is available over the counter in the U.S., and mifepristone can only be prescribed and dispensed by certified prescribers. “Anti-choice lawmakers know the next chapter in abortion care will center on medication abortion. And they’re starting to quietly wage a war, hoping to cut off access to a safe and effective abortion method before most Americans even know about it.” Medication abortion can be obtained in a few different ways, but typically people set up an appointment at their local abortion clinic and are sent home with a bag of pills to be taken over the next 72 hours. Leigh was recently one of those people, making the 20-minute drive to a clinic in Washington, D.C., to come home with a handful of abortion pills and Netflix their way through the abortion from the comfort of their bed. “I was thankful I didn’t have to be in a clinic, that I could be at home in familiar surroundings and just try to relax as best as I could,” they said. (Leigh, who is nonbinary, is using a pseudonym for privacy reasons.) But obtaining abortion pills in a clinic setting is becoming increasingly more difficult depending on where you live. In the last few years, anti-choice lawmakers have ramped up their efforts to restrict access to in-person clinic care by using targeted regulation of abortion providers, also known as TRAP laws, and other medically unnecessary restrictions, such as state-mandated waiting periods between the consultation and getting the pills prescribed, required counseling that’s not based in science or laws that force people to listen to fetal activity before accessing an abortion. In states like Oklahoma and Texas, which have extreme abortion bans, people are forced to take multiple-day journeys out of state just to access a handful of abortion pills. Since in-clinic access has all but disappeared in many red states, some providers have moved online, allowing people in certain states to access abortion pills by mail. States including California, New York and Colorado allow telehealth for abortion before the 10-week mark, through online pharmacies like Hey Jane and Abortion On Demand. This means that a physician can virtually prescribe and send abortion pills right to your doorstep, allowing you to manage your abortion from the comfort of your home. And it’s clear there’s a growing interest in accessing abortion pills from these online pharmacies. Before the Supreme Court draft decision leaked in early May, Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, an advocacy organization that provides people with information on how to obtain abortion pills, told HuffPost her website averaged around 2,500 visitors every day. The night the draft decision leaked, Wells said her website saw 16,000 visitors. The next day, it had 56,000 visitors. But with more awareness of the benefits of and easy access to abortion pills, comes more attacks from abortion opponents. Heavyweight anti-choice groups like Susan B. Anthony List and Americans United For Life stated at the start of this year that restricting abortion drugs is a top priority in 2022. Already, 19 states have banned prescribing medication abortion via mail or by virtual telehealth visits. This year alone, Missouri lawmakers introduced bills that would equate mailing abortion pills to drug trafficking. In Kentucky, lawmakers created a public database that lists the name of medication abortion providers so that people can anonymously report any purported violations of the state’s abortion laws. Tennessee lawmakers passed a bill making it a felony to mail medication abortion, punishable by a $50,000 fine or up to 20 years in prison ― a similar law passed in Texas last year. And all of the draconian abortion bans in places like Texas, Oklahoma and Idaho apply to both procedural and medication abortions. “In the face of these unjust laws and unjust court decisions, this is what we want people to know: There is something you can do,” Wells said. “We’ll tell you where to find these pills, how to use them, how to get support and what you need to know about the landscape around using pills for self-managed abortion, including the potential legal risk.” As access to in-clinic and telehealth abortion dwindles in red states, some women and birthing people will prefer self-managing their own abortions because it’s easier than navigating the ever growing list of barriers. And many will simply be forced to self-manage their abortions because they don’t have any other options. Thankfully, self-managing your own abortion with medication looks very similar to one done in a clinic or via telemedicine. A self-managed abortion is done outside of a traditional health care setting, often when a person obtains abortion pills not from a physician and undergoes an abortion without medical assistance. Because medication abortion is extremely safe and effective, it will ensure that we don’t go back to the pre-Roe days of botched abortions that left so many dead. There are several ways to to get abortion drugs outside of the traditional health care setting, including in Mexico, where misoprostol is widely available over the counter. People can also go through Aid Access, an Austria-based nonprofit that prescribes medication abortion via mail to all 50 states. Aid Access can offer telehealth abortion anywhere in the U.S. despite specific state restrictions because their provider is based in Austria. This allows the group to circumvent U.S. regulations that penalize providers, and prescribe medication free of legal risk. Obtaining abortion pills through Aid Access is not technically characterized as a form of self-managed abortion because patients are guided through the process by a physician. But most people who need to go through Aid Access are likely navigating state restrictions or bans on abortion. Managing an abortion outside of traditional health care settings brings with it certain legal gray areas. “People have been targeted for criminalization for self-managed abortion in this century in numerous states where prosecutors misapply laws that were never intended to be used against somebody for ending a pregnancy,” said Sara Ainsworth, the senior legal and policy director at If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice. “One of the reasons we understand that that happens is, in addition to the political opposition to abortion, is that there’s so much stigma that surrounds abortion generally,” she added. “The idea that it must be illegal if someone is managing an abortion on their own is unfortunately very pervasive.” “The more stigmatized and banned abortion is, the more people will be forced to self manage and the more likely it is that politically motivated prosecutors will look to other laws to try to go after the people who self-manage their care and investigate, prosecute or criminalize them in some way.” Lizelle Herrera is a perfect example of how the law can be misunderstood and incorrectly applied when it comes to self-managing abortions. Herrera, a 26-year-old Texas mother of two, was arrested and charged with murder in April for allegedly self-inducing an abortion. Many of the details around Herrera’s case are unknown, but she likely used medication to terminate her own pregnancy. She was held in a jail with a half-million-dollar bail. But self-managing your own abortion is not illegal in Texas. It’s actually not illegal in any of the 50 states except Nevada, South Carolina and Oklahoma ― and legal experts caution that it’s unclear if those laws would even stand up in court if challenged today. The charges against Herrera were eventually dropped, but her story is emblematic of what could come if Roe falls and half of the states ban abortion. “The more stigmatized and banned abortion is, the more people will be forced to self manage and the more likely it is that politically motivated prosecutors will look to other laws to try to go after the people who self-manage their care and investigate, prosecute or criminalize them in some way,” Ainsworth said. Many pro-choice lawmakers in blue states, however, are preparing for a post-Roe world where prosecutors misunderstand or misapply the law to people self-managing care. Washington state just passed a law that bans the criminal legal system from investigating or prosecuting people who self-manage their abortions or anyone who helps them. California and Michigan are also debating similar measures, including ballot initiatives to ensure people are not criminalized for their pregnancy outcomes. While abortion pills will revolutionize access and allow people to self-manage their abortions in a post-Roe world, there are glaring limits. Dr. Christie Pitney, a provider at Aid Access and the CEO of Forward Midwifery, cautioned that there will always be people who don’t know their options or are too afraid of presumed legal risks to attempt to self-manage. Or people who are simply past the 12-week point and will need a procedural abortion. “Medication abortion will absolutely not be enough of a stop-gap. It will help to an extent, but it won’t be the end all be all,” Pitney said. “The ideal situation would be that folks can choose between community care, getting a medication abortion or procedural abortion at a clinic in their area, or choosing telehealth. It shouldn’t be that politics is forcing us to choose one option over the other.” Every single abortion restriction that has passed into law in modern history excludes one person from being punished: the pregnant person. Most measures target physicians; other laws, like those in Texas and Oklahoma, also penalize anyone who aids and abets someone looking to get an abortion. But never the person getting an abortion. This is important because it avoids criminalizing people for any pregnancy outcome, including a miscarriage of a wanted pregnancy, and ensures that women cannot be thrown in jail for self-managing their own abortions with abortion drugs. At least for now. Louisiana recently tried to pass a law that would allow prosecutors to charge women who got abortions with criminal homicide. Although the bill drew immediate criticism and never made it to a vote, it’s emblematic of what could come ― especially if Roe falls. “We know that criminal law penalties and sanctions fall hardest on historically marginalized communities who are already subject to racism in so many systems,” said Smith, from the Center for Reproductive Rights. “When we think about a future where abortion is unavailable in potentially half of the states and we think about people exerting their bodily autonomy by self-managing their abortions,” she added, “there is an anticipation that the racialized prosecutions we’ve seen in the history of prosecutions based on pregnancy outcomes would likely accelerate.” It’s hard to truly understand the many ways the fall of Roe will impact people across the country. But a few things are definitive: There will be delays in care and an onslaught of misinformation. Many will be forced to self-manage their own abortions, and many more will simply be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. To get a glimpse of a post-Roe future, just look to Texas, said Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas). “On a number of levels, Texas represents the dystopian vision that Republicans have for Americans,” she said. “The Republican Party has become an extremist movement and when you have politicians who are angling for that extremist base, they will stop at nothing. So, Texas absolutely does give us insight into the kind of future that Republicans want for women and healthcare professionals.” If you or anyone you know needs assistance self-managing a miscarriage or abortion, please call the Miscarriage + Abortion Hotline at (833) 246-2632 for confidential medical support or the Repro Legal Helpline at (844) 868-2812 for confidential legal information and advice.

12,Trump Lawyer's Request To Join 'Pardon List' Spawns A Meme,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Twitter erupted with memes Thursday after the Jan. 6 House select committee revealed a brazen email written by an attorney who advised then-President Donald Trump on his effort to overturn the 2020 election. “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works,” John Eastman wrote in an email Rudy Giuliani, then Trump’s personal attorney, in the days following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress. The House select committee presented the document Thursday in its third day of hearings, alongside other evidence indicating that Eastman publicly championed the theory that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to certify fake slates of electors to keep Trump in office while privately acknowledging it likely wouldn’t stand up in court. That admission could be used to argue that Eastman knowingly committed a crime when he pressured Pence to obstruct the electoral vote count, which the vice president presided over on the day of the Capitol riot. Eastman spoke at Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally just before the assault on the Capitol. In his remarks, he pushed the former president’s lie that the election had been rigged and demanded that Pence send the official Electoral College results back to the states. Hundreds in the crowd went on to storm the U.S. Capitol, some chanting “hang Mike Pence” as they took matters into their own hands to attempt to keep Trump in power.

13,Critics In Stitches After GOP Lawmaker Deletes Mortifying Take On Jan. 6 Hearings,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) tried to attack CNN and the Jan. 6 House select committee hearings Thursday and succeeded only in getting egg on his face. The Florida lawmaker, like many of his Republican colleagues, looked for a way to dismiss this month’s hearings from the House committee presenting its findings about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. “In case you forgot the sham #January6thcommitteehearings are purely for TV ratings, [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi let The Communist News Network build a full TV set where Abraham Lincoln’s desk once stood,” he tweeted, sharing an image of a CNN discussion about Thursday’s proceedings. Rep. Greg Steube removed his tweet calling CNN ""The Communist News Network"" who built ""a full TV set where Abraham Lincoln's desk once stood"" because was informed this what we the TV business refer to as a screen. pic.twitter.com/h7HLPEOFCa He then deleted his tweet, ostensibly after he became aware that CNN was using a digital screen in a studio and not actually setting up shop in the National Statuary Hall, where Lincoln’s desk was once located and where rioters waving Trump flags paraded on Jan. 6. Steube was one of the 147 Republicans in Congress who voted to overturn the 2020 election results even after the mob of Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the electoral votes that the then-president wanted to overturn in his favor. Earlier this year, Steube made headlines after he waved three guns around during a virtual hearing on gun violence. Scroll for the reaction to Thursday’s tweet: Something that actually did happen: insurrectionists incited by Trump's Big Lie stormed the Capitol on January 6th, some carrying the Confederate battle flag.

14,10 Important Moments From The Third Jan. 6 House Committee Hearing,politics," Reporter, HuffPost In its third day of hearings, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol narrowed in on two opposing figures that day: John Eastman, the lawyer who helped Donald Trump craft a plan to overturn the election, and Mike Pence, the vice president who refused to play along. In both live and recorded testimony, attorneys, aides and other people in Trump’s orbit on Jan. 6 last year defended Pence’s actions and accused Eastman of wreaking havoc on American democracy. Here are some of the most notable moments from Thursday’s hearing. Greg Jacob, who was Pence’s legal counsel at the time of the Capitol riot, told the committee Thursday that Eastman made it very clear to Trump that the plan they’d crafted to overturn the election was illegal. “I believe he did on the 4th,” two days before the riot, Jacob said of Eastman’s conversation with Trump about rejecting the official slates of state electors in order to stop the election’s certification by Congress on Jan. 6. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), vice chair of the select committee, said of Eastman: “He knew the outcome he wanted, and he saw a way to go forward if he simply pretended that fake electors were real.” A memo he wrote asserting that Pence could declare Trump the winner “was false, and Dr. Eastman knew it was false. In other words, it was a lie,” she said. In a December 2020 email the committee presented, Eastman acknowledged that his and Trump’s plan to use alternative electors in the certification would be “dead on arrival” if presented before Congress. Jacob said Thursday that Eastman privately acknowledged to him that if Pence did what he was asking him to do and the matter went before the U.S. Supreme Court, they would “lose 9-0.” However, Jacob said Eastman didn’t think the matter would end up before the highest court. Jacob said he asked Eastman to consider the absurdity of what he was suggesting, reminding him that Al Gore was vice president when he lost the presidential election to George W. Bush in 2000: “If you were right, don’t you think Al Gore might have liked to have known in 2000 that he had authority to just declare himself president of the United States?” Jacob summarized Eastman’s response as: “Al Gore did not have the basis to do it in 2000. Kamala Harris shouldn’t be able to do it in 2024. But I think you should to it today.” The committee played testimony from Eric Herschmann, a lawyer and former senior adviser to Trump, who said Eastman cared little about the barbarity his plan could unleash. “You’re going to cause riots in the streets,” Herschmann recalled telling Eastman, who allegedly replied: “There’s been violence in our history to protect the republic.” After all hell broke loose, Eastman sought a way out. Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), who led Thursday’s hearing, said Eastman wrote an email to Rudy Giuliani, another one of Trump’s lawyers, “a few days after” Jan. 6 asking for help avoiding legal repercussions. “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works,” wrote Eastman. He also invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate himself 100 times during his testimony, the committee said. Pence’s onetime chief of staff, Marc Short, told the committee that Pence informed the president “many times” that he didn’t have the power to overturn the election and that it would be illegal for him to try to do so. That contradicts statements made by Trump, who said before the insurrection that he and Pence were in “total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.” Pence has never indicated that to be true. Jacob also said Thursday that Trump’s claims were false. “We were shocked and disappointed because whoever had written and put that statement out, it was categorically untrue,” Jacob said. Jacob shared that in early December, he and Pence discussed whether the 12th Amendment gave him the power to overturn the election and that Pence’s first instinct was that it did not. Jacob said he agreed and put together a memo stating that, adding at Thursday’s hearing that it’s “just common sense” that the Constitution’s framers would never “have put in the hands of one person the authority to determine who was going to be the president.” In video testimony from Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who served as one of the president’s advisers, she said her father had a profanity-laden call with Pence as the events unfolded on Jan. 6 “The conversation was ... was pretty heated. It was a different tone than I’d heard him take with the vice president before,” she recalled in the testimony aired Thursday, adding that he used “the p-word.” Nicholas Luna, a former assistant to Trump, said in his testimony: “I remember hearing the word ‘wimp.’ Either he called him a wimp — I don’t remember if he said, ‘You are a wimp, you’ll be a wimp.’ Wimp is the word I remember.” Aguilar said that the committee’s investigation found that the crowd of rioters were within 40 feet of Pence inside the Capitol at one point. “Approximately 40 feet. That’s all there was. Forty feet between the vice president and the mob,” he said. “Make no mistake about the fact that the vice president’s life was in danger.” The committee also played videos of the mob chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.” Aguilar also said they found evidence that the mob got more out of control when Trump tweeted mid-riot: “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done,” referring to his refusal to throw out the election results. “Our investigation found that immediately after the president’s 2:24 p.m. tweet, the crowds both outside the Capitol and inside the Capitol surged,” Aguilar said, adding that Pence then had to be moved to a secure location. The committee aired testimony from White House staffers who said that was exactly what they feared might happen. Deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said that after staff urged Trump to tweet something that would calm the crowd, he instead tweeted his attack on Pence. “The situation was already bad, so it felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire by tweeting that,” she said. Retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig, who served as a legal adviser to Pence before the Capitol riot, said at the hearing Thursday that he was still very worried about Trump’s influence, calling him, his allies and supporters “a clear and present danger to American democracy” because of their stated plans to overturn the 2024 presidential elections if Trump runs and loses again. “Our democracy today is on a knife’s edge,” he said. Had Pence done that Trump wanted of him, Luttig also said, “it would’ve been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the republic.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,New Mexico Prosecutor Says GOP County Must Comply With Order To Certify Votes,politics," SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s top prosecutor on Thursday told a Republican-led county commission to comply with an order to certify results from its primary election, the latest development in a case arising from far-right conspiracy theories over voting machines that have spread across the country. A spokesperson for Attorney General Hector Balderas said the Otero County commission “must comply with the rule of law or we will take legal action.” The governing commission in Otero County refused to certify the local results of the state’s June 7 primary because of unspecified concerns with the equipment, even though it has identified no problems with the Dominion systems used by the county to tally paper ballots. Following the 2020 election, various allies of former President Donald Trump claimed that Dominion voting systems had somehow been manipulated as part of an elaborate scheme to steal the election, which President Joe Biden won. The secretary of state’s office asked the attorney general to investigate the Otero County commission for possible violations of state election and government ethics laws. That came after the state Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the county commission to certify its election results. Otero County Attorney Roy Nichols said an emergency meeting of the commission is scheduled for Friday, ahead of the state’s certification deadline. He said he could not speak for the commissioners and it’s unclear whether they will vote to certify the results. If they don’t, he said it would be possible for state officials to pursue election code violations against them. So far, all but 10 of New Mexico’s 33 counties have certified their results from the statewide primary. No other county officials have said publicly that they intend to vote against certification. There is no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting equipment in the 2020 election, and election experts say the refusal to certify results of free and fair elections threatens the democratic process.

16,Girlfriend Of Capitol Officer Who Died Sends Icy Message To Jared Kushner And Ivanka Trump,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The girlfriend of late U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick has pointed the finger at Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump for their part in the insurrection that led to her partner’s death. Sandra Garza appeared Thursday on CNN following the third hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Her boyfriend, Sicknick, was assaulted during the riot, collapsed after returning to his office that day and died about eight hours later. Medical officials said he suffered two strokes. “I was actually more moved on the first hearing with a lot of the testimony that I heard,” Garza said, “because there was so many people that could have intervened and said, ‘You know what? I’m going to go to the media. I’m going to go to the press. I’m going to scream from the rooftops and try and stop this.’” “They knew Trump intimately. They knew how dangerous he was. And nobody did anything to stop him.” Sandra Garza, partner of fallen Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, asks Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner why they didn’t try to stop the insurrection before it happened pic.twitter.com/Uzr9oWXdFg Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper if she was referring to former President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Kushner, Garza said “absolutely, yes. Ivanka in particular.” “I mean, families were decimated because of what happened on the sixth. People died because of what happened on the sixth.” She noted that Kushner, in testimony aired at last week’s hearing, said he thought of White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team’s repeated threats to resign in the days before the attempted coup as “whining.” “They basically had a conscience,” Garza said, but Kushner just put that down to “whining.” In Ivanka Trump’s testimony, she said she believed former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who dismissed Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was rigged as “bullshit.” “Tell Jared Kushner what you think,” Tapper told Garza. Looking directly into the camera, Garza said: “Jared, Ivanka, yes, it’s hard to stand up to a family member, a father, father-in-law. But you could have done something. You could have avoided the bloodshed that took place, including the suicides that took place after. People died.” Garza said Sicknick was a Republican and had voted for Trump.

1,Sonia Sotomayor Reassures Liberals As Conservative Decisions Loom,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Justice Sonia Sotomayor didn’t tell a gathering of liberal lawyers Thursday what will happen in the big upcoming abortion decision, nor did she give any hint of when it would drop. She didn’t talk about the internal drama roiling the court or how she’s getting along with her colleagues. These topics were off-limits for her speech at the American Constitution Society convention. But she did perhaps offer some reassurance to the crowd — ahead of what is expected to be a devastating series of decisions for progressives coming in June — that ultimately, “the arc of history bends toward justice.” In response to a question about rapidly declining public trust in the Supreme Court, Sotomayor said that institutions like the court are made up of human beings and that it is human nature to “make mistakes.” One “mistake” she raised was the 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford where the court found that Black people “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,” therefore denying them the rights and privileges of citizenship throughout the entire United States. The Dred Scott decision is widely agreed to be among the worst decisions issued by the Supreme Court in its history, both for its racism, inaccurate history and poor legal reasoning. But, as Sotomayor noted, the decision was ultimately overturned by the adoption of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. And even though the racist logic continued in the court’s Plessy v. Ferguson decision upholding racial segregation, that, too, was overturned in the Brown v. Board of Education decision. “When we, as institutions, have made mistakes,” Sotomayor said. “Other parts of the branches [of government]” and “the people have worked to make change.” “Dred Scott lost his 11-year battle for freedom,” she said. And yet, with the decision in Brown, “He won the war.” “That’s why I think we have to have continuing faith in our court system, in our system of government,” she added, noting that that the system allows for constitutional amendments and legislation to address outcomes like Dred Scott. That is why “I truly believe in the magical words, ‘the arc of the universe bends towards justice,’” she said. Sotomayor’s comments come as the Supreme Court’s six-vote conservative supermajority is expected to overturn the 1973 precedent in Roe v. Wade enshrining abortion rights when it rules in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in the coming weeks. In May, Politico released a leaked draft opinion showing that five conservative justices had already aligned themselves to overturn Roe. Since then, the court has been described as “in turmoil,” “imploding” and seething “with resentment.” Protesters appeared outside of the homes of the conservative justices who appear ready to overturn Roe. One man, outraged over Roe’s imminent demise, called the police on himself as he planned to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the marshal of the Supreme Court to launch an unprecedented leak investigation. Investigators have asked clerks to turn over their phones, and clerks, in turn, have hired lawyers. While Sotomayor made no comment on the turmoil within or surrounding the court, Justice Clarence Thomas was more forthright in a talk hosted by a conservative think tank in May. In pointed public comments, Thomas, now the longest-serving justice on the court, said he no longer trusted his fellow justices. “When you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I’m in, it changes the institution fundamentally,” Thomas said at a May 14 event hosted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “You begin to look over your shoulder. It’s, like, kind of an infidelity that you can explain it, but you can’t undo it.” Thomas even said that the court has not been the same since former Chief Justice William Rehnquist died in 2005 and was replaced by current Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts, notably, was the lone conservative justice not to join the draft opinion that leaked. No one has yet taken responsibility for leaking the opinion. There have been a handful of theories about whether the leak came from progressives or conservatives. Sotomayor’s invocation of Dred Scott can only be seen as a call for the next generation of liberal lawyers to keep the faith as they see the progressive advances of the 20th century rolled back by the current court’s conservative supermajority. At the end of her remarks, as she walked around the conference room shaking hands with attendees, the justice explained how she deals with setbacks and losses. “There are days where I get discouraged,” she admitted. “There are moments where I am deeply, deeply disappointed. And, yes, there have been moments where I have stopped and said, ‘Is this worth it anymore?’” “And every time I do that, I lick my wounds for a while,” she added. “Sometimes I cry. And then I say, ‘OK, let’s fight.’” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,"Pro-Trump Mob Was 40 Feet From Mike Pence In Capitol Attack, Says Jan. 6 Panel",politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The mob of pro-Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was at one point 40 feet away from former Vice President Mike Pence, and some rioters wanted to kill him, according to details revealed Thursday in the latest hearing of the committee investigating the attack. “Approximately 40 feet. That’s all there was,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), who led most of the hearing’s proceedings. “Forty feet between the vice president and the mob.” The committee had just aired footage from Jan. 6, which featured hundreds of riled up rioters demanding that Pence carry out former President Donald Trump’s demand that he reject the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost. The video featured people chanting, “Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!” Outside the Capitol, footage showed that the insurrectionists had constructed an actual hangman’s gallows. Greg Jacob, Pence’s former counsel and one of two witnesses testifying on Thursday, was with Pence on Jan. 6. as they fled the mob and hid in an undisclosed location for hours. He learned in Thursday’s hearing, along with everyone else, just how close the rioters were to reaching the vice president. “I could hear the din of the rioters in the building while we moved,” Jacob recalled. “But I don’t think I was aware that they were as close as that.” Aguilar then dropped another stunning detail: A recent court filing from the Justice Department revealed that a confidential informant from the Proud Boys, the far-right neofascist group that took part in the Capitol attack, told the FBI that the Proud Boys “would have killed Mike Pence if given the chance.” That same informant also told the FBI, “Anyone they got their hands on, they would have killed, including Nancy Pelosi,” said Aguilar, referring to the House speaker, a Democrat from California. “Make no mistake about the fact that the vice president’s life was in danger,”Aguilar added. During his testimony, Jacob provided some new details about what Pence was doing as the attack unfolded. There were discussions among Pence and his security as to whether the vice president should leave the building, something Pence insisted he would not do. Asked if Trump had called the vice president at all to check on his safety during the hours-long attack, Jacob simply said, “He did not.” He said Pence and his wife reacted to that “with frustration.” Trump had called Pence in the morning of Jan. 6, and after he failed to persuade Pence to reject the election results, the president apparently erupted with anger. He called Pence “a wimp,” one Trump aide told the committee in a previously recorded deposition. Ivanka Trump told the committee in her deposition that Trump called Pence “the p-word.” Pence was “steely, determined, grim” after that call, recalled Jacob. The other witness in Thursday’s hearing was former federal judge J. Michael Luttig, who previously advised Pence on the legal argument rejecting Trump’s attorney’s theory that Pence could thwart the election results. Speaking slowly and solemnly, Luttig told the committee that if Pence had obeyed Trump’s orders and declared him the next president on Jan. 6, 2021, it “would have plunged America into what I believe would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis.” The United States would have been facing “its first constitutional crisis since the founding of the Republic,” he said.

3,Bipartisan Gun Talks Hung Up Over ‘Boyfriend Loophole’,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON – The bipartisan group of lawmakers working on a bill to curb gun violence is struggling to finalize several issues, including provisions dealing with “red flag” laws and closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole.” “We don’t have a deal yet ... It’s time to fish or cut bait,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Thursday, expressing frustration with the status of the talks after several rounds of meetings failed to produce an agreement this week. A group of 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans, including Cornyn, agreed to an outline of a bill that would close the “boyfriend loophole” and create incentives for states to pass “red flag” laws, which are designed to seize weapons from those deemed to be a danger to themselves and others. Federal law prohibits several categories of offenders from owning firearms, including people who have been convicted of domestic violence. But the law applies only to current or former spouses, people who lived together or people who have children together — it excludes someone in a romantic relationship who doesn’t share a child or an address. An average of 70 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month, according to an analysis of CDC data by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. The negotiators have struggled with how to define a “boyfriend” or partner in the Senate bill. Republicans worry that overly broad definition would lead to Second Amendment violations. “I’m begging [Democrats] to come up with something that I can get my arms and my head around right now because we need something very clear. And so far, we haven’t gotten there yet,” Cornyn told reporters on Wednesday. The House of Representatives has repeatedly addressed the boyfriend loophole through passage of the Violence Against Women Act, but Republican senators complained about the provision and it was ultimately dropped from the final version of the legislation that made it to President Joe Biden’s desk this year. The House bill would have changed the law to included a “dating partner or former dating partner” on the list of domestic violence perpetrators barred from having guns. It defined a dating partner as someone “who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the person” and said the relationship did not have to be sexual. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), one of the core gun negotiators, said the House language remained unacceptable. “During the violence against women [debate], we had difficulty and what we’re trying to do is just find some language ... that hopefully bridges the gap,” Tillis told HuffPost this week. Nineteen states impose their own gun restrictions on intimate partners; Tillis said Thursday after leaving a meeting that the negotiators were looking at state definitions, but he declined to elaborate. “The definition is there for the taking, and so my hope is that we’ll be able to get that locked,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. Closing the boyfriend loophole has been a longstanding Democratic priority. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) pushed for it to be addressed in this round of bipartisan talks over gun violence. If the Senate legislation ultimately does not close the boyfriend loophole, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) lamented that “a very small bill would shrink even more.” “Support for this bill on the Democratic side is largely made up of people who believe that something is better than nothing but the Republicans keep whittling down on something,” Warren told HuffPost. The negotiations are operating on a tight timeline. Democrats want to pass the bill before the two-week July 4 recess and they need agreement on bill text in order to make that happen. It’s already been nearly a month since the horrific elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and any added delays threaten to further slow momentum for federal gun reforms.

4,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

9,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Homeland Security Tightens Scrutiny Of Internal Misconduct,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Employees accused of misconduct at the Department of Homeland Security could face more stringent penalties under an overhaul announced Thursday that follows complaints about the handling of internal discipline in the third largest U.S. government agency. DHS said it will standardize serious misconduct investigations in a sprawling organization that includes Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The new procedures are the result of a review ordered by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in April after reports revealed that thousands of employees had experienced sexual harassment and misconduct and that some DHS components paid settlements without penalizing or even investigating the perpetrators. “The deeply concerning reports this spring underscored the need for urgent action to prevent and address harassment and other misconduct in the workplace,” Mayorkas said in a statement outlining the changes. Some of the changes to the internal disciplinary procedures, Mayorkas said, have already been put in place while others will occur in the coming months after consultations with the various unions representing an agency that has about 230,000 employees. A key aspect of the changes will be to make the response to allegations of misconduct as well as the potential penalties more uniform across DHS, the agency said. It will also centralize investigations within the components to avoid scenarios in which serious cases are handled by an employee’s supervisor. Employees found to have committed some kind of misconduct, which can include such behavior as theft, sexual harassment or abusing people detained by the law enforcement components, have typically faced a broad range of potential penalties. The penalties will be more specifically spelled out and the range narrowed under the new policy to create a “more accurate system of accountability,” a senior DHS official said. In some cases, when the potential range has been too broad, the penalty for misconduct has been “inadequate,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the policy changes ahead of their release. The agency didn’t specify how the changes would affect individual components, because there is a wide spectrum in how each now handles allegations of misconduct. But the official acknowledged that the new policy would address criticism of Customs and Border Protection. “There has been public criticism of some of the discipline at CBP and I think it stands to reason that we may do more centralization there as well as other places,” the official said. The impetus for the review was the release of details from draft reports from the DHS Office of Inspector General. One from December 2020 showed that more than 10,000 employees of CBP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service and the TSA had experienced sexual harassment or sexual misconduct at work — over one-third of employees who responded to a survey. Another showed that DHS law enforcement agencies paid nearly $1 million in settlements to 21 employees to resolve allegations of sexual harassment despite inspectors finding no record of an investigation or disciplinary action. The draft reports were obtained by the nonpartisan Project on Governmental Oversight and published by The New York Times. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Trump Adviser Seemed To Know His 'Fake Elector' Plan Was Garbage,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost The conservative law school professor advising then-President Donald Trump on his effort to overturn the 2020 election appeared to know his legal theory was bogus, the Jan. 6 committee argued Thursday. During its third day of hearings, the committee presented evidence that lawyer John Eastman, who publicly championed the theory that former Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to certify fake slates of electors to keep the former president in power, admitted privately that it likely wouldn’t stand up in court. Eastman acknowledged to Pence attorney Greg Jacob that he believed the Supreme Court would likely unanimously strike down the plan, Jacob testified. Eastman seemed to be more confident in an alternate idea for delaying the certification of the election: Pence could send election results back to the states. Both of those efforts were part of a broader push to stop Congress from certifying the election results ― a normally routine procedure that on Jan. 6, 2021, sparked an insurrection. The Jan. 6 committee argued on Thursday that Trump and his allies, Eastman included, spurred on the attack on the Capitol by pushing lies about the election. The “fake elector” theory was part of that plot. After Trump lost the 2020 election to now-President Joe Biden, Republicans in seven battleground states devised plans to form alternate slates of electors to help overturn the results. Eastman told Jacob that if Pence did certify these electors, the Supreme Court would side against him. “[Eastman] initially started, ‘Well, maybe you’d only lose 7-2,’ but ultimately acknowledged that, no, we would lose 9-0. No judge would support his argument,” Jacob testified. That admission could be used to argue that Trump’s outside attorney knew he was committing a crime when he pressured the vice president to obstruct the electoral vote count. The committee also revealed Thursday that Eastman requested a pardon from Trump in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. “I’ve decided I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works,” Eastman wrote in an email to Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The committee pointed to a memo by Eastman that argues there’s a “historical precedent” for the vice president to reject state’s electors, an idea that former federal judge Michael Luttig shot down unequivocally in his testimony. Luttig, an adviser to Pence, said there was no such precedent for a vice president deciding the outcome of the election. “There was no support whatsoever, either in the Constitution of the United States nor the laws of the United States for the vice president, frankly, ever to count alternative electoral slates from the states that had not been officially certified,” Luttig testified. Jan. 6 committee vice chair Liz Cheney (R.-Wyo.) said Eastman was well aware that there was no precedent for his theory. “This was false, and Dr. Eastman knew it was false,” Cheney said. “In other words, it was a lie.” Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Rep. Bennie Thompson Says It's Time For Ginni Thomas To Talk To Jan. 6 Committee,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost So far, Ginni Thomas has avoided answering questions under oath about her involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But that seems to be changing thanks to the reports of emails between Thomas and John Eastman, the lawyer who advised former President Donald Trump how to fight the election results. Previously, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol seemed hesitant to question Thomas, whose husband is Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, but the emails recently obtained by the committee seem to be a tipping point, committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said Thursday. “We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee,” Thompson said, according to a tweet by Axios reporter Andrew Solender. NEW: Jan. 6 Select Committee Chair Bennie Thompson says they will request testimony from Ginni Thomas in light of the Eastman emails.“We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee.” Later Thursday, Thomas told the conservative website the Daily Caller that she “can’t wait to clear up misconceptions” about her involvement. Still, the existence of the emails — which was first reported by The Washington Post Wednesday —shows Thomas was more involved in trying to reverse Trump’s election defeat than previously known. It comes on the heels of news that she also emailed more than two dozen Republican state lawmakers in Arizona in her attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Thomas has not commented on the emails, and the contents and timing of the exchanges has not been revealed. Despite her efforts, her husband has repeatedly refused to recuse himself from cases related to Jan. 6. In fact, Clarence Thomas was the only justice to support Trump’s attempt to block the release of White House documents and communications sought by the House committee investigating his effort to overturn the election. Not surprisingly, Twitter users had thoughts to share about Thompson’s statement suggesting Ginni Thomas could face a subpoena if she doesn’t voluntarily speak to the committee. I'm sure she'll just swing on by when it's convenient, no biggie. https://t.co/MS0moGHlqE Tell her to bring her +1, if you know what I mean. 😈⚖️⚖️⚖️⚖️⚖️⚖️ https://t.co/0yeGkMsbWd Can't wait for them to ask Ginni Thomas if she gave John Eastman insider intel on a ""heated fight"" happening between Supreme Court justices about whether to take up Trump's case...https://t.co/CaPks9eAIY https://t.co/2rwH65N1aR It would damage the J6 committee's credibility NOT to seek testimony from Ginni Thomas.

13,Jan. 6 Committee Lays Out Election Theft Scheme That Nearly Got Mike Pence Killed,politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s last-gasp scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power put his own vice president’s life in grave peril, as Trump’s social media attack on Mike Pence further enflamed the mob that had already breached the U.S. Capitol, the House Jan. 6 committee detailed in a hearing Thursday that included the revelation that the pro-Trump Proud Boys group was prepared to murder Pence on that day. Committee chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Pence himself explained in a recent speech that it was “un-American” to do what Trump wanted. “Mike Pence said no. He resisted the pressure. He knew it was illegal. He knew it was wrong,” Thompson said. The pressure on Pence, which Trump had been applying in both private and public for weeks, continued even on Jan. 6 itself, with a late morning phone call Trump initiated. The call became “heated,” according to testimony revealed Thursday, with one former Trump aide telling investigators that he heard Trump call Pence “a wimp” and say he had “made the wrong decision” five years earlier when he chose Pence as his running mate. An aide to daughter Ivanka Trump said she was upset because Trump had called Pence “the ‘P’ word.” Just three hours later, after Pence publicly announced he would not do as Trump wanted, Trump tweeted an attack on Pence, claiming the vice president “didn’t have the courage” to do what was necessary. “Donald Trump turned the mob on him,” Thompson said. The committee revealed evidence from the Department of Justice’s investigation into the Proud Boys extremist group that a witness has sworn that “they would have killed Mike Pence if given the chance.” Committee member Peter Aguilar, a California Democrat, showed a video illustrating how close the pro-Trump attackers got to Pence, his staff and his family as the Secret Service hustled them to safety. “Approximately 40 feet. That’s all there was,” Aguilar said. “Forty feet between the vice president and the mob.” As the panel had done in the other two hearings in the past week, it shared testimony from Trump’s own inner circle to show how damning Trump’s actions were in the weeks leading up to the Capitol assault and on that day itself. On Thursday, it came from Greg Jacob, the former counsel to Pence at the White House who testified in person, and from former Pence chief of staff Marc Short, who provided videotaped testimony. Both were with Pence in the Capitol on Jan. 6, and Jacob told the committee he had not realized how close the attackers had gotten. “I could hear the din of the rioters in the building as we moved, but I wasn’t aware they were as close as that,” he said. Also appearing in person was J. Michael Luttig, the retired federal appellate judge who, at the request of Pence, helped him with a statement that was released as Trump was still speaking at his pre-insurrection rally near the White House on Jan. 6. Luttig told the committee that had Pence “obeyed the orders from his president,” it would have thrown the country into the first true constitutional crisis since the founding. “That declaration of Donald Trump as the next president would have plunged America into what I believe would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis,” Luttig testified Thursday. Integral to Trump’s plan were the slates of fake, pro-Trump electors that Trump’s campaign began organizing not long after his loss was confirmed. These groups met in seven states won by Joe Biden on Dec. 14, 2020, the day of the Electoral College vote, to send fraudulent Trump ballots to Washington, D.C. The strategy was for Pence, having before him “competing slates” of electors from these states, to invalidate all of them, leaving Trump with a majority of electoral votes from the remaining states — which would let Pence award Trump a second term. Alternatively, Pence could send the ballots back to the states, where GOP-controlled legislatures would override the popular votes in those states and declare Trump the winner. That theory was pushed by a group of pro-Trump lawyers, led by John Eastman, who were pressing Pence to act unilaterally. Jacob, who had been conducting an extended argument with Eastman on the topic, said his own research into the Constitution and the 1887 Electoral Count Act made it clear that the drafters of the Constitution, having recently broken free of a tyrannical king of England, would not have put such power into the hands of the vice president. “There was no way they would have put it in the hands of one person to determine who would be the president of the United states,” Jacob testified Thursday. Luttig said Eastman was simply wrong. “There was no basis in the Constitution or laws of the United States for the theory espoused by Mr. Eastman at all. None,” he said. Pence, in any event, refused to go along with the scheme, and in the days leading up to Jan. 6 enlisted the help of Luttig, a longtime icon in conservative legal circles who was considered for the U.S. Supreme Court by former President George W. Bush. Luttig on Jan. 5 posted a series of tweets explaining why Pence had no authority to do what Trump was demanding. “The Constitution does not empower the vice president to alter in any way the votes that have been cast, either by rejecting certain of them or otherwise,” Luttig wrote. Pence’s team then cited that Twitter thread in the letter he released to Congress and the public at the start of the certification ceremony on Jan. 6. The committee on Thursday revealed that Eastman, in the closing days of Trump’s tenure, asked Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani for a pardon. “I’ve decided I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works,” an email displayed by the committee read. Committee member Peter Aguilar, a California Democrat, then showed video of Eastman repeatedly claiming the Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate himself in his deposition before committee investigators. “Dr. Eastman pled the Fifth 100 times,” Aguilar said. The bipartisan committee is nearly halfway through a series of public hearings intended to lay out Trump’s role in stoking anger among his millions of followers following his election loss and then inviting them to Washington, D.C., for the express purpose of intimidating Pence and lawmakers into letting him remain in power anyway. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. He spurred on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot — a last-ditch attempt to remain in office — which led to five deaths, including one police officer, injuries to an additional 140 officers and four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024. Based on that, Luttig offered the committee and the country a warning near the hearing’s close: “Donald Trump and his allies and supporters, are a clear and present danger to American democracy,” he said. “I don’t speak those words lightly.” Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,"Amid Push To Stem Gun Violence, Republicans Reject Biden's ATF Nominee In Committee",politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Amid bipartisan efforts to do something — anything — to stem the nation’s epidemic of gun violence, Senate Republicans demonstrated Thursday that they won’t even support the simplest of steps: confirming a permanent director at the top agency that enforces federal gun laws. Every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted against advancing President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Steven Dettelbach. The committee vote was an 11-11 tie. The Republicans who voted no are Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), John Kennedy (La.), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.). Notably, Cornyn is currently leading the bipartisan effort to pass a gun safety package in response to recent mass shootings, including the devastating attack in his home state, where 19 children and two teachers were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Dettelbach still advanced to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. But only after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) forced Dettelbach out of the committee by filing a discharge petition later in the day. The vote was 52-41 to move Dettelbach’s nomination to the floor, with just two Republicans joining all Democrats in voting yes: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Rob Portman (Ohio). Seven GOP senators did not vote. “We need a fully functional, fully staffed ATF in order for that agency to fulfill its mission of keeping our communities safe from gun violence,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, just before the vote. “Obviously, the gun safety legislation we’re negotiating is very important, but so is having a fully functioning ATF.” The ATF hasn’t had a permanent director in seven years. The position, which has long faced opposition from gun rights groups who don’t want anyone confirmed to run the agency charged with regulating them, has only had one Senate-confirmed director in 16 years. Ahead of Dettelbach’s committee vote, chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said a vote to confirm him is a vote to make the nation safer. He noted that Dettelbach, who has a two-decade career as a Justice Department prosecutor, has been endorsed by virtually every major law enforcement organization in the country. “Seven years, no leadership,” Durbin said. “For stability, for responsiveness, for accountability and for agency morale, this is long overdue.” Dettelbach appears to have the votes to be confirmed, which would be a huge win for Biden and gun safety advocates. He is the president’s second pick for the job; his first choice, David Chipman, failed to advance last year after a handful of Democrats wouldn’t support him. This time around, those same Democrats ― Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Jon Tester (Mont.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with Democrats ― have signaled support for Dettelbach.

15,Mitt Romney Got More Republicans To Back Monthly Child Allowance,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Since last year, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has been the only Republican on Capitol Hill willing to embrace a monthly cash allowance for parents. Now he’s got two conservative colleagues, Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.) and Richard Burr (N.C.), co-sponsoring his Family Security Act, a bill that would pay parents as much as $350 a month per child. Their support shows growing bipartisan momentum for an idea long discussed on the left — one that other rich countries put into practice decades ago. Romney’s bill is broadly similar to the monthly child tax credit payments Democrats put in place for six months last year but failed to continue after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) refused to support an extension. If Democrats can’t muster 50 votes among themselves, the only way to resurrect the monthly payments would be some sort of bipartisan compromise. Now that Romney has won over two more Republicans, the bipartisan path looks a little more plausible. “I’m willing to sit down with them and look at several provisions,” Romney said Wednesday. “There are a number of things they won’t like in our bill, and we’ll have to work on a bipartisan basis to get something that we can all agree to.” A key difference between the Republican bill and what Democrats did last year is that Republicans would deny payments to parents with zero income. In other words, the GOP bill has a “work requirement” — something Manchin had insisted on that Democrats refused to include. Romney had omitted such a work requirement from a similar bill last year that no other Republican supported. “The first version didn’t have a work requirement, and we got lots of pushback that, ‘Hey, this shouldn’t be a welfare program, people should be required to work,’” Romney told HuffPost. “So we added a work requirement and therefore some people come back and say, ‘Hey, why do you have a work requirement?’ So you could prove you can’t satisfy all the people all the time, but the work requirement is modest, meaning it’s $10,000 for a couple for an entire year.” Allowing the poorest parents to receive payments last year was a top priority for Democrats because that’s how the payments slashed child poverty by nearly 30%. Romney’s bill would allow low earners to receive only partial benefits, meaning it would cut child poverty by only 12.6%, according to an analysis by the Niskanen Center. Another major difference between the two approaches is that Republicans would offset the cost of their bill by eliminating a handful of tax benefits, including the deduction for state and local taxes — something that Democrats from New Jersey and other coastal states would strenuously oppose. Still, Democrats said they were heartened by Romney’s bill. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), a key proponent of the child tax credit, said he deeply appreciated Romney’s effort to get more Republicans on board. “While we have clear policy differences, one thing is certain — we can’t continue to allow 11M kids to live in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world,” Bennet tweeted. Republicans approach the issue of paying parents from a different direction than Democrats do. Democrats want to reduce child poverty, which results from a lack of parental income, while Republicans want to encourage more people to have babies. They also might want to show more support for parents as the Supreme Court prepares to roll back Roe v. Wade. Romney touted support for his bill from anti-abortion groups like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and National Right to Life. His bill would allow expectant mothers to begin claiming the monthly benefits. “This life-affirming provision not only empowers mothers, but acknowledges that life begins before birth,” National Right to Life said in its endorsement of the bill. Bennet and Romney have told HuffPost in recent weeks that they’ve been having informal conversations about the child benefit, but Romney said he can’t really negotiate with Democrats until they quit negotiating among themselves about their previous vehicle for the policy, a doomed bill known as the Build Back Better Act. “If it really goes away, then I think they will be interested in sitting down and seeing if we can find a bipartisan deal,” Romney said.

16,Republican Election Deniers Quiet On Fraud Claims After Primary Wins,politics," Nevada Republican Jim Marchant insisted there hadn’t been a legitimate election in his state in more than a decade. All of Nevada’s election winners since 2006, he said on a recent podcast, were “installed by the deep-state cabal.” But when Marchant won the Republican nomination for Nevada secretary of state this week, he immediately celebrated the victory as legitimate. “I am beyond humbled by the overwhelming support of our campaign. Nevadans made their voices heard,” Marchant declared on social media. Such inconsistency has become a hallmark of election deniers in Republican primary contests across the U.S. in this year’s midterms. Dozens of GOP candidates who sought former President Donald Trump’s backing in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere have spent months parroting his baseless claims of 2020 election fraud but then declared victory without raising such concerns in their own elections. Amid such seeming hypocrisy, many Republican candidates are still vowing to pursue a series of election reforms that could make it more difficult to vote — particularly for those who traditionally support Democrats — in the name of election integrity. Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison warned that “MAGA Republicans will do anything in their desperate chase for power.” “From undermining our democracy by spreading Trump’s Big Lie, to laying the groundwork to try to cancel votes when they don’t agree with the outcome, but falling silent if they win, this is today’s Republican Party,” Harrison told The Associated Press. In Nevada on Tuesday, Marchant was among a slate of election deniers who secured their places on the November ballot without questioning the legitimacy of the results. The group included candidates for Senate, state treasurer and a Las Vegas-area congressional seat. That’s even as the majority of counties relied upon Dominion voting machines, which continue to be the target of conspiracy theories by Trump and his allies. The phenomenon extends well beyond Nevada. In Pennsylvania, Republican nominee for governor Doug Mastriano spearheaded a state Senate hearing in which witnesses — including former Trump campaign attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani — aired false claims about mass voter fraud. Mastriano also was outside the U.S. Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building during the deadly 2021 insurrection. And he later tried to bring a partisan election audit to Pennsylvania before he was stripped of his committee chairmanship by his own party. Mastriano made no mention of voter fraud as he declared victory in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for governor last month. “God is good,” a smiling Mastriano told cheering supporters. The Mastriano campaign declined to respond to a question about the apparent double standard. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also ignored questions about his contradictory positions on voter fraud. Paxton won his fiercely contested primary last month after spending much of the last year championing Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud. In the aftermath of Joe Biden’s presidential win, Paxton filed a legal challenge to the election results in four battleground states. He asked the U.S. Supreme Court to set them aside and allow the Republican-controlled state legislatures to determine the winner. Seventeen other Republican state attorneys general supported the effort. The high court rejected the challenge three days after the lawsuit was filed, finding Texas did not have standing to sue other states over how they conduct their elections. And the state bar moved to discipline Paxton just days after his primary win, claiming his leading role in petitioning the Supreme Court to block Biden’s victory was “dishonest.” State and federal election officials across the country and Trump’s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the election was tainted. The former president’s allegations of fraud also were roundly rejected by courts, including by judges he appointed. But after nearly two years of Trump’s constant claims that the election was “stolen,” which have been embraced by hundreds of Republican candidates across the U.S. seeking his support, an extraordinary number of Americans have lost faith in the U.S. election system. Only 45% of U.S. adults said they have significant confidence that votes in the 2022 midterm election will be counted accurately, and 30% have some confidence, according to a February AP-NORC poll. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to be very confident, 66% vs. 24%. Polling continues to show most Republicans have doubts about the 2020 presidential election. In July 2021, 68% of adults ― but only 33% of Republicans ― said Biden was legitimately elected president, according to an AP-NORC poll. Sixty-six percent of Republicans said he was not legitimately elected. In addition to key state officials, several Trump-backed Senate candidates promoted the specter of election fraud over and over — except when delivering their primary victory speeches in recent weeks. Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker repeatedly claimed Biden’s victory was tainted by fraud over the last year and even called for seven swing states Trump lost to vote again. Ohio GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance claimed the 2020 election was “rigged” or “stolen.” North Carolina Senate nominee Ted Budd, a Republican congressman, refused on the day of his May primary victory to say that Biden won the 2020 presidential election. And Pennsylvania Republican nominee for Senate Mehmet Oz said there was “definitely” widespread fraud in his state, even as the evidence says otherwise. None raised similar claims about their own primary victories. In Nevada, state GOP Chair Michael McDonald said Marchant acknowledging his primary win wasn’t hypocritical because he continued to have questions about vote-counting in the Las Vegas area. “He was questioning the results last night, even though he was winning, which I found admirable,” McDonald said, recounting a 1:30 a.m. phone call with Marchant. Marchant did not respond to requests for comment, but his campaign consultant Rory McShane said he continued to have questions about voting in Clark County, which leans Democratic and is where the vast majority of the state’s population lives, despite the race being called for him. There may be no more vocal proponent of Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud falsehoods than Marchant, a 66-year-old former failed congressional candidate. Marchant was present in Carson City when the party sent a dueling slate of electoral votes to Congress in December 2020. Throughout the primary, he was a fixture at rural county commission meetings during discussions about Dominion voting machines and potentially switching to hand-counting ballots. And he has toured the country with other 2020 election denialists, using phrases and terminology associated with QAnon conspiracy theorists. Cisco Aguilar, the Democrat running against Marchant, described the Republican’s statements about the 2020 election, voting machines and mail-in ballots as out of touch with reality. In an interview, Aguilar said he feels immense responsibility after Marchant’s victory and said he’s now weighing questions he hadn’t anticipated when he entered the race, such as whether agreeing to a debate would be giving a conspiracy theorist a platform. “He’s created a massive fear among a subgroup of individuals here in Nevada,” Aguilar said. “I don’t even know if you can have a debate with someone who is unwilling to listen.” ___ Peoples reported from New York and Metz reported from Salt Lake City.

1,Republican Election Deniers Quiet On Fraud Claims After Primary Wins,politics," Nevada Republican Jim Marchant insisted there hadn’t been a legitimate election in his state in more than a decade. All of Nevada’s election winners since 2006, he said on a recent podcast, were “installed by the deep-state cabal.” But when Marchant won the Republican nomination for Nevada secretary of state this week, he immediately celebrated the victory as legitimate. “I am beyond humbled by the overwhelming support of our campaign. Nevadans made their voices heard,” Marchant declared on social media. Such inconsistency has become a hallmark of election deniers in Republican primary contests across the U.S. in this year’s midterms. Dozens of GOP candidates who sought former President Donald Trump’s backing in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere have spent months parroting his baseless claims of 2020 election fraud but then declared victory without raising such concerns in their own elections. Amid such seeming hypocrisy, many Republican candidates are still vowing to pursue a series of election reforms that could make it more difficult to vote — particularly for those who traditionally support Democrats — in the name of election integrity. Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison warned that “MAGA Republicans will do anything in their desperate chase for power.” “From undermining our democracy by spreading Trump’s Big Lie, to laying the groundwork to try to cancel votes when they don’t agree with the outcome, but falling silent if they win, this is today’s Republican Party,” Harrison told The Associated Press. In Nevada on Tuesday, Marchant was among a slate of election deniers who secured their places on the November ballot without questioning the legitimacy of the results. The group included candidates for Senate, state treasurer and a Las Vegas-area congressional seat. That’s even as the majority of counties relied upon Dominion voting machines, which continue to be the target of conspiracy theories by Trump and his allies. The phenomenon extends well beyond Nevada. In Pennsylvania, Republican nominee for governor Doug Mastriano spearheaded a state Senate hearing in which witnesses — including former Trump campaign attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani — aired false claims about mass voter fraud. Mastriano also was outside the U.S. Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building during the deadly 2021 insurrection. And he later tried to bring a partisan election audit to Pennsylvania before he was stripped of his committee chairmanship by his own party. Mastriano made no mention of voter fraud as he declared victory in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for governor last month. “God is good,” a smiling Mastriano told cheering supporters. The Mastriano campaign declined to respond to a question about the apparent double standard. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also ignored questions about his contradictory positions on voter fraud. Paxton won his fiercely contested primary last month after spending much of the last year championing Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud. In the aftermath of Joe Biden’s presidential win, Paxton filed a legal challenge to the election results in four battleground states. He asked the U.S. Supreme Court to set them aside and allow the Republican-controlled state legislatures to determine the winner. Seventeen other Republican state attorneys general supported the effort. The high court rejected the challenge three days after the lawsuit was filed, finding Texas did not have standing to sue other states over how they conduct their elections. And the state bar moved to discipline Paxton just days after his primary win, claiming his leading role in petitioning the Supreme Court to block Biden’s victory was “dishonest.” State and federal election officials across the country and Trump’s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the election was tainted. The former president’s allegations of fraud also were roundly rejected by courts, including by judges he appointed. But after nearly two years of Trump’s constant claims that the election was “stolen,” which have been embraced by hundreds of Republican candidates across the U.S. seeking his support, an extraordinary number of Americans have lost faith in the U.S. election system. Only 45% of U.S. adults said they have significant confidence that votes in the 2022 midterm election will be counted accurately, and 30% have some confidence, according to a February AP-NORC poll. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to be very confident, 66% vs. 24%. Polling continues to show most Republicans have doubts about the 2020 presidential election.

2,"Herschel Walker, After Disparaging Absent Dads, Has More Kids You Didn’t Know About",politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker confirmed that he actually has four children, following revelations that the critic of absentee fathers has a 10-year-old son with whom he reportedly has limited contact. In addition to the 10-year-old, the aspiring Georgia senator has a 13-year-old son as well as an adult daughter who he had when he was around 20 years old, The Daily Beast first reported Thursday. He also has a 22-year-old son who he has previously publicly disclosed. This brings his total, publicly reported children to four. “I have four children. Three sons and a daughter. They’re not ‘undisclosed’ - they’re my kids. I support them all and love them all,” Walker said in a statement to HuffPost Thursday. The former football star, who has received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, said he has never denied having four kids ― despite conflicting comments made by his campaign Wednesday. Walker said he reported the four children to the federal government when appointed to the President’s Council on Sports Fitness and Nutrition by Trump in 2018. He reportedly shared with the Daily Beast a copy of the form he filled out for this appointment, which listed the names and ages of all four kids. Walker, in his statement to HuffPost, said he “chose not to use them as props to win a political campaign. What parent would want their child involved in garbage, gutter politics like this?” “Saying I hide my children because I don’t discuss them with reporters to win a campaign? That’s outrageous. I can take the heat, that’s politics - but leave my kids alone,” he added. Walker’s campaign has made no prior mention of these children until now. In a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday, his campaign manager, Scott Paradise, said he had one child when he was unmarried years ago. “Herschel had a child years ago when he wasn’t married,” the statement said. “He’s supported the child and continues to do so. He’s proud of his children. To suggest that Herschel is ‘hiding’ the child because he hasn’t used him in his political campaign is offensive and absurd.” News of Walker’s additional children is noteworthy as he has been a public critic of children being raised in fatherless homes. The Daily Beast reported Tuesday that the mother of his 10-year-old son had to sue Walker after giving birth in order to secure a declaration of paternity and child support from the former NFL player. He has not played an active parental role in this younger son’s life, though he sends him Christmas and birthday presents, The Daily Beast reported, citing a person close to the child’s family. In a 2020 interview with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Walker called fatherless homes a “major, major problem” in Black communities and described himself as acting “like a father” to fatherless kids in the Georgia town where he grew up. “Remember, you can leave the wife, but don’t leave your child,” he said he advises young men he meets. In another 2020 interview with conservative video bloggers Diamond and Silk, Walker disparaged Black fathers who leave boys to be raised by their mother. He likened this to when Black families were separated during slavery. “Even if you have to leave that woman — you don’t leave that child,” he said.

3,John Hinckley Jr.'s Concert Canceled After Backlash To Reagan Shooter's Gig,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The show won’t go on for the man who shot President Ronald Reagan. John Hinckley Jr.’s upcoming concert in Brooklyn, New York, has been canceled, the venue announced Wednesday. (See the full notice below.) Hinckley, who this week was freed from court supervision 41 years after attempting to assassinate the president, has been trying to launch a performing career. He has posted several of his original songs on YouTube. He also joined Spotify. The Market Hotel wrote on Instagram that it originally booked Hinckley for July 8 because it would be a “memorable night” and send a message that a criminal past “can be atoned for.” But it conceded the planned show was antagonizing people to the point that it was raising safety issues. “If we were going to host an event for the principle, and potentially put others at risk in doing so, it shouldn’t be for some stunt booking — no offense to the artist,” the venue wrote. “We might feel differently if we believed the music was important and transcended the infamy, but that’s just not the case here.” Hinckley, 67, became a free man this week after the remaining restrictions of his court-supervised living in Virginia were lifted. Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside a Washington hotel in 1981, wounding the president, partially paralyzing press secretary James Brady and injuring two other men. Brady died in 2014. Hinckley, found not guilty due to insanity, spent most of his confinement in a Washington mental hospital.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

10,Ginni Thomas Exchanged Emails With Trump Lawyer John Eastman: Report,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is in possession of emails Ginni Thomas, the wife of conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, exchanged with John Eastman, a lawyer advising former President Donald Trump how to overturn the 2020 election. The correspondence shows Thomas was more involved in trying to reverse Trump’s election defeat than previously known, two sources told The Washington Post. The content of the emails, and the timing of the exchanges, wasn’t known. Earlier this month, a judge ordered Eastman to surrender 159 documents to the House panel. In another email exchange dated Dec. 24, 2020, reviewed by the committee and detailed in The New York Times, Eastman wrote to Kenneth Chesebro, another lawyer supporting Trump, and other Trump officials, that Supreme Court justices were arguing over whether to hear a case contesting the results of the 2020 election. In the email, Eastman discussed filing a lawsuit over the results in Wisconsin, hoping to nudge at least four justices needed for the Supreme Court to take a case. “So the odds are not based on the legal merits but an assessment of the justices’ spines, and I understand that there is a heated fight underway,” Eastman wrote, two sources told the Times. “For those willing to do their duty, we should help them by giving them a Wisconsin cert petition to add into the mix,” Eastman continued. Eastman, who previously clerked for Clarence Thomas, will also be a focus of Thursday’s Jan. 6 hearing. The panel’s third public hearing is set to illustrate Trump’s efforts on Jan. 6 and the days before to pressure his vice president not to certify electoral votes. “President Trump plotted with a lawyer named John Eastman and others to overturn the outcome of the election on Jan. 6,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said in a video posted by the committee on Twitter. A message from Vice Chair @RepLizCheney about Thursday’s hearing. pic.twitter.com/SsnOOEnyVq The video also included an excerpt from the committee interviewing Eric Herschmann, a former White House lawyer, who said Eastman called him the day after Jan. 6. “He started to ask me about something dealing with Georgia and preserving something potentially for appeal,” Herschmann said. Herschmann also recounted legal advice he offered to Eastman, before hanging up. “Get a great f’ing criminal defense lawyer, you’re going to need it,” Herchmann said. This is not the first time Ginni Thomas’ role in supporting Trump has come under the spotlight. A few days following the 2020 election, Thomas emailed 29 state lawmakers in Arizona, calling on them to ignore Joe Biden’s win and instead appoint electors in support of Trump, according to another Post report. She wrote they had “power to fight back against fraud” and “ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen,” even though Biden won the state by more than 10,000 votes. The House panel has also reviewed text messages Thomas sent to Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows from November 2020 to January 2021, calling on him to fight the result of the democratic election. “Do not concede,” she wrote Meadows on Nov. 6, 2020. “It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.” The House panel was reportedly considering pursuing a voluntary interview with Thomas in March. Since then, committee members have said Thomas is not seen as “a focal point.” “Well, she was not really a focal point of the broader committee’s work,” committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told CBS News on May 19. “She just happens to be the wife of a Supreme Court justice.” The new emails with Eastman, though, could change this calculus, with the committee now considering allocating time to review Thomas’ efforts to overturn the election, according to The Post. Thomas also told the Washington Free Beacon she attended the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Ellipse, preceding the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. “I was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on Jan. 6,” Thomas said in the interview. “There are important and legitimate substantive questions about achieving goals like electoral integrity, racial equality, and political accountability that a democratic system like ours needs to be able to discuss and debate rationally in the political square. I fear we are losing that ability.” Ginni Thomas also insisted she kept her opinions “separate” from those of her husband. “Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles, and aspirations for America,” Thomas told the Free Beacon. “But we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me, and I don’t involve him in my work.” Clarence Thomas did not disclose his wife’s role in plotting to overturn the election. The Supreme Court has no ethics rules on conflicts of interest. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"Bill Clinton, Ex-NRA Member, Gives Down-Home Advice On Persuading Other Side",politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Former President Bill Clinton, who signed an assault weapons ban that lasted for 10 years, said Wednesday that reform supporters can win new firearms-safety measures by watching their tone with gun enthusiasts. (Watch the video below.) Clinton explained on “The Late Late Show” that an overwhelming majority of people support sensible reform, “but the gun culture itself is sufficiently strong that there are more people who are against doing something than for it, if it’s a voting issue. A lot of gun owners are inherently suspicious of government, easy to spook, and don’t want to take a chance.” Browbeating the fearful won’t help, Clinton told host James Corden. Clinton noted that he grew up in gun culture in Arkansas, still owns a hunting rifle and used to belong to the National Rifle Association — “when they cared about resolving real issues.” Americans who fear laws will strip them of personal or hunting firearms merit respect, he said. “Don’t talk down to them,” Clinton said. “Instead of telling them they’re dumb if they don’t agree with you, ask for their help. ... It’s not necessary for somebody to agree with you to trust you with their vote.” Recent mass shootings in New York and Texas have made the issue boil over again, prompting the Senate to work on a bipartisan framework to curb the violence. But convincing the skeptical requires understanding, according to Clinton. “We gotta reach people where they live,” the former president said.

12,Sarah Palin Advances In Special Election For Alaska's Only U.S. House Seat,politics," JUNEAU, Alaska — Republican former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Republican Nick Begich and independent Al Gross have advanced to the August special election for the state’s only U.S. House seat. Palin, Begich and Gross, an orthopedic surgeon, were among 48 candidates in last Saturday’s special primary for the seat, which was left vacant following the death in March of Republican Rep. Don Young. Young had held the seat for 49 years. The top four vote-getters in the special primary advance to a special election, set for Aug. 16, in which ranked choice voting will be used. The winner of that race will serve the remainder of Young’s term, which ends in January. State elections officials were releasing vote counts on Wednesday, the first day since the special primary in which counts were held. Counts also are planned for Friday and Tuesday. With 132,730 votes counted, Palin had 28.3%, followed by Begich with 19.3% and Gross with 12.8%. Democrat Mary Peltola had 8.7% and Republican Tara Sweeney, 5.5%. The election was unusual in that it was conducted primarily by mail. It also was the first election under a system approved by voters in 2020 that ends party primaries and institutes ranked voting for general elections. The election went on as scheduled following a legal fight over ballot access issues, with the state defending itself against accusations that the manner in which the election was held discriminated against voters with visual impairments. Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, held significant name recognition in a field that also included current and former state legislators and a North Pole city council member whose name is Santa Claus. Many of the candidates were relative unknowns. Begich comes from a family of prominent Democrats, including uncles Mark Begich and Tom Begich, who have both held elected office. Gross unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2020 with the endorsement of state Democrats. Alaska Democratic party leaders in this race urged voters to pick a Democrat. Peltola, who was one of six Democrats on the ballot, is a former state lawmaker. Sweeney was an assistant secretary of Indian Affairs in the U.S. Department of Interior during the Trump administration. Palin told The Associated Press on Wednesday she felt good about the campaign she’s run but wanted to see the final numbers. In a statement on election night, Palin said she was looking forward to the August special election. Palin said Wednesday she would be looking forward to it whether she had qualified for the race or not. She said she would remain positive and would “never play ... the politics of personal destruction because I’ve been on the receiving end of that, and I wouldn’t want that to happen to my worst enemy.” The campaigns of Begich and Gross have reminded voters Palin resigned as governor and questioned her motives in running for the House. Palin “quit on Alaska,” Gross said. “She had a chance to stay in the fight for Alaska, but she chose to chase cheap fame,” Begich’s campaign said in a fundraising appeal. Palin, making her first bid for elected office since resigning as governor partway through her term in 2009, attributed her resignation to an onslaught of records requests and ethics complaints she said were frivolous and had become distractions. Palin took issue with those who have questioned her ties or commitment to the state. “I’m so Alaskan I hit a moose the other night,” she said, adding that her vehicle got totaled but that she was fine. During this race, Palin touted endorsements from a number of national figures, including former President Donald Trump. Palin was an early supporter of Trump during his 2016 presidential bid, and he participated in a telerally for her. An August primary and November general election will decide who serves a two-year House term beginning in January. Palin, Begich and Gross are running in that race. Peltola and Sweeney also are candidates. Sweeney in a statement said she would meet with her campaign team and supporters in the coming days to determine “next steps” after she said it appeared that she would “fall just short” of advancing to the special election. Begich wasn’t immediately available for comment Wednesday. An email seeking comment was sent to Gross’ campaign. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,The End Of Roe Would Be A Disaster For These Women — And Too Many People Are Ignoring It,politics,"  This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. When a draft decision that would fully overturn Roe v. Wade and end abortion access for millions of women leaked in early May, Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the decision, had a curious and inflammatory aside. He suggested that Black people who get abortions are committing genocide against their own race. In the draft, Alito wrote that some abortion advocates are “motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the African American population” and that this theory is correct because the majority of people who have had an abortion are Black. But he did not mention pregnancy-related deaths among those very same people. The real danger for Black mothers will come if Alito’s draft becomes the court’s final decision. Black women in the U.S. already face a dismal maternal death rate, and studies have shown that restricting abortion access will lead to a surge in pregnancy deaths. More than half the states have trigger laws in place, meaning if Roe falls, abortion becomes illegal in that state. Reproductive health experts and advocates have been warning that this outcome will lead to an increase in deadly illegal abortions, the criminalization of pregnancy and a rise in the already high Black maternal death rate. The United States’ maternal death rate is uniquely horrifying. Data shows that after years of declining, the rate began ticking back up starting in the year 2000, and researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that two out of three deaths were preventable. The maternal death rate and the end of Roe are inextricably linked. If someone is denied an abortion, they are more likely to stay pregnant. The people who will have the hardest time accessing an abortion in a post-Roe world are Black, and they are more likely to die during pregnancy. According to the CDC, in 2020 the maternal mortality rate was 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. But for Black people, the mortality rate was 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is 2.9 times the rate for their white counterparts. Contrary to mainstream anti-abortion talking points, abortion deaths are exceedingly rare. In 2018, the latest data available from the CDC, two people died from complications from a legal abortion. The data shows that remaining pregnant is the more dangerous option. “Forcing people to remain pregnant can kill them.” Even though anti-choice activists and conservative leaders say their crusade to end legal abortion stems from so-called pro-life beliefs, there doesn’t seem to be any concern for the lives of pregnant people. “Pregnancy can be less safe for some,” Jamila Taylor, the director of health care reform and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, told HuffPost. “And a lot of that is rooted in health equity and racism.” The worsening Black maternal death rate isn’t something that is set in stone, but rather a result of policy choices. There are several different reasons why the Black maternal death rate is higher than other racial groups, but most trace back to structural racism. Black people are less likely to be listened to by their doctors. Higher rates of poverty mean that they are more likely to suffer from illnesses and diseases that can cause pregnancy complications. Lack of access to health care means that some complications are missed entirely. Overturning Roe will have repercussions across the country, the brunt of it will fall on the backs of Black birthing people and women — many who already live in states with little access to abortion care and higher maternal mortality rates. “States that have the poorest maternal health outcomes also have the most draconian abortion restrictions,” Taylor said. “These issues are obviously intertwined.” In a study, Amanda Stevenson, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, found that if there were a nationwide abortion ban — an idea on the to-do list of GOP politicians — there would be a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths overall. For Black people, that increase would be 33%. “It’s just a whole lot deadlier to stay pregnant and that increase in deadliness is profoundly and unjustly distributed,” she said. “Forcing people to remain pregnant can kill them.” The fall of Roe would mean that in states where abortion is illegal, health care providers who are trying to save pregnant patients’ lives could also have to deal with strict policies that are made by lawmakers rather than based on science. “I care for patients every week who are making difficult decisions about whether to terminate or carry their pregnancy to term because of a risk to their own health,” Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University, told HuffPost. While states with the most severe restrictions like Texas and Oklahoma have exceptions for maternal health reasons, it’s not as simple as doctors deciding that an abortion is a necessary medical procedure. Swartz said he’d have to worry if his reasoning meets the legal requirements for an abortion. The doctor treats many patients who deal with health issues that could be a threat to their lives. “I’ve cared for a number of patients who have early onset preeclampsia,” Swartz said, referring to a potentially fatal pregnancy complication. “I’ve cared for patients who need an abortion because they’re in renal failure and patients that face a 30-50% mortality risk if they get pregnant.” Abortion restrictions can take away the option to terminate, even if patients face dangerous health outcomes. “Those decisions are already hard to make,” Swartz said. “And these barriers are making them more difficult.” A certain faction of religious extremists, conservative activists and Republican politicians has spent decades working to overturn Roe. They have chipped away at reproductive rights by passing laws and restrictions that are already forcing people to have unsafe abortions and criminalizing pregnancy. The fact that the most marginalized people are already suffering under this regime and will only suffer more once the final nail is in the coffin is not something that should surprise anyone. For supporters of reproductive rights, the hypocrisy is infuriating: How can anti-abortion activists call themselves pro-life when they know that the thing they’re trying to accomplish will lead to more deaths? But when have the deaths of Black people been a concern for followers of Christian conservatism? Black people are more likely to die of COVID, from police violence and due to poverty. For far too many, that’s just business as usual. There is no definitive number on how many more Black people will die from pregnancy-related causes when Roe falls. “The projections that we have are best guesses and there are a lot of assumptions,” Stevenson said. But that’s not really the important question, she said. “Don’t ask how many will die, but why will more people die?” "
14,Blue State Abortion Providers Are Bracing For A Massive Surge In New Patients,politics," Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. The looming U.S. Supreme Court decision on abortion is expected to upend access to the procedure as we know it, leaving in its place a patchwork of states where the legal right to abortion varies and bottlenecking patients in places where the procedure remains safe and accessible. “This will truly be a public health crisis like this country has never seen before,” said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, who serves as the chief medical officer for reproductive health services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, or PPSLR. “We are now going to be mass mobilizing tens of thousands ― perhaps millions ― of people for basic reproductive health care,” she said of the patients in the 22 states that will automatically outlaw or severely restrict abortion if the court strikes down Roe v. Wade ― which a bombshell leaked draft indicates the justices are planning to do. McNicholas’ Planned Parenthood branch operates the sole remaining abortion clinic in Missouri and one just over the border in Illinois, which it opened in 2019 as the fight over abortion in Missouri began exploding. Abortion providers across deep-blue Illinois, meanwhile, are gearing up to operate as a so-called “abortion island” surrounded by a sea of states ready to outlaw the procedure as soon as the court strikes down Roe. “This will truly be a public health crisis like this country has never seen before.” For people in Missouri ― where Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt said an all-out abortion ban would go into effect “immediately” if Roe falls ― Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin and beyond, Illinois may soon be their closest destination for an abortion. “We feel like we have a responsibility as an abortion oasis in this vast desert from care in the Midwest,” said Jennifer Welch, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Illinois. She’s anticipating anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 additional out-of-state abortion patients a year if the court strikes down Roe ― a massive leap from the roughly 60,000 people the provider has seen annually for all reproductive health care needs in recent years. There’s a similar feeling at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, or PPRM, which operates in several mountain west states, including two that are poised to become abortion safe havens: Colorado and New Mexico. Dr. Kristina Tocce, PPRM’s medical director, spoke frankly when asked if she’s confident they’ll be able to meet the demand. “Not at all,” she said. “I feel confident that we are going to deliver excellent, safe, compassionate abortion care to as many patients as we can, which will be more patients than we have served in the past, but if you just look at the numbers ... it’s just such an exponential increase.” There are more than 30 million women and girls of reproductive age in the U.S. at risk of losing access to legal abortion in their states, Tocce emphasized. Realistically, she said, “there are going to be patients that simply cannot access care.” If Roe falls, abortion providers in Colorado and New Mexico will be the closest abortion destinations for many people in several states likely to cut off access, including Utah, Arizona, Wyoming and Nebraska. They’re already seeing a major influx in patients from Texas, which enacted a six-week abortion ban last September, and Oklahoma, which followed suit with an even more restrictive law. Expanding telemedicine services is essential to keep up with demand, Tocce said, noting that PPRM had already begun broadening those systems in recent years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For much of the first trimester, pregnancy may be terminated with a series of prescribed pills that don’t necessarily require a clinic visit. “If we can take care of as many patients as we can outside of the brick-and-mortar facilities, that’s going to be so instrumental in getting more patients who need in-person visits into those centers,” she said. In Illinois, Welch said, they’ve been preparing for the fall of Roe since the day former President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. “Every time that president got another nominee on the Supreme Court, we knew that it was over,” she said of abortion protections. Since then, the Illinois branch has embarked on a big fundraising campaign, doubling the size of some existing clinics and building new ones along the borders of states that are hostile to abortion, including one near Indiana in 2018 and one near Wisconsin in 2020. They’re welcoming any out-of-state clinic staff who want to start assisting with the surge in Illinois. “Clinics have been turning every available space into procedure rooms, and it hasn’t been enough to meet the need.” The additional capacity for abortion care has already proven essential in recent years as nearby states whittled away at access with mandatory waiting periods, medically unnecessary ultrasounds and other barriers. The abortion bans in Texas and Oklahoma ― which relied on a legal loophole to proceed without the Supreme Court’s approaching ruling ― have only compounded that need in recent months. Elizabeth Nash, a state policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, said it’s not unusual for clinics to schedule appointments two to four weeks in advance right now, due in part to absorbing patients from Texas and Oklahoma and to the national health care worker shortage. If the court strikes down Roe as expected, Nash said, “I am anticipating that the influx of patients will be such that the wait times will increase beyond that.” “Clinics have been turning every available space into procedure rooms, and it hasn’t been enough to meet the need,” she said of blue states’ efforts to absorb new patients. Having to wait longer for an abortion may mean patients need a more involved procedure and have a longer recovery time. One clinic in Colorado, another abortion island state, told Kaiser Health News in March that it had recently purchased equipment enabling staff to perform abortions up to 20 weeks into pregnancy in anticipation of longer wait times. PPSLR has seen a 50% increase in abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy since the Texas ban went into effect compared to the year prior. Alongside staffing needs, McNicholas’ biggest concern is ensuring practical support for patients who must leave their home states for abortion care. “We could add another 150 clinics to Illinois, but if patients cannot get to them, then it doesn’t matter,” she said. Key to that undertaking, McNicholas said, is a regional logistics center that PPSLR opened in January in partnership with Hope Clinic, another Illinois abortion provider near the Missouri border. There, case workers have been helping patients make sure the cost of their treatments is covered by abortion funds and connecting them with practical support organizations focused on helping patients travel for abortion care. That can be an expensive endeavor. Fund Texas Choice, a group that’s been assisting patients traveling for abortions since 2013, told HuffPost last year that out-of-state trips can add at least $800 to the cost of an abortion. That includes transportation, lodging, food, medication and child care. “The health care part is the easy part,” McNicholas said, adding that she believes PPSLR and the Hope Clinic can manage the annual 15,000 new patients they’re expecting to come to southern Illinois for abortions. “But we really have to be able to manage the navigation piece and the logistics piece that folks are going to be facing.” The logistics center has four case workers on staff right now who are trained to help navigate more than 50 different abortion funds, McNicholas said, adding that it hopes to hire up to 14 additional employees. Simply informing people that abortion will remain legal in some states in the event Roe falls is also important at this juncture, Welch said. “We’ve had patients call asking, ‘Can I still come in to my appointment? Is it illegal yet?’” she said. “It’s never going to be illegal in Illinois; not if we have anything to say about it.” Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Having A Baby Will Cost You. Here’s Exactly How Much My Daughter’s Birth Cost Me.,politics," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. The politicians and activists who decry abortion often brush past the cost of pregnancy. Someone with an unwanted pregnancy can just put the child up for adoption, they suggest, or perhaps a family member can care for it. As Republicans seek to end abortion rights and the Supreme Court prepares to potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the suggestion seems to be to just have the baby and figure it out. But a pregnancy isn’t that simple. There’s the physical toll: the fatigue, sickness, possibility of long-term health issues and even, rarely, death. The emotional difficulty. The stress of needing to leave work for appointments (I had “only” 13, but those with added complications can have appointments multiple times per week) and taking sick days (I took at least four, and would have needed more if I had a job that required me to be on my feet). The struggle of finding a way to afford time off for the birth and postpartum recovery in a country with no national paid maternity leave (this one was not, luckily, an issue for me personally; my husband had to take unpaid leave). Some of these things are hard to quantify. One thing isn’t: the hospital bill. The cost of childbirth can vary a huge amount depending on type of birth, insurance, region and hospital. For patients on Medicaid, nearly all pregnancy and birth costs are covered. These patients make up a large share of births: Medicaid paid for 42% in the U.S. in 2019. But that leaves many births covered by private insurance, for which patients usually foot more of the bill. How much? On average, about $2,000. And that’s just for the birth itself. The Health Care Cost Institute, an independent nonprofit, analyzed data from more than a third of the population with employer-sponsored insurance to dig into the out-of-pocket costs of childbirth. It found that those costs ranged from an average of $974 in Michigan to $2,685 in Nebraska, with a national average of $1,905 out of pocket. Costs can go much higher: The 90th percentile cost to patients for delivery was $4,327, according to HCCI’s analysis. C-section births were typically more expensive, with an out-of-pocket cost of $1,962 on average nationally, whereas vaginal births cost patients an average of $1,875. Within those payments, HCCI found that the average cost of anesthesia services, such as an epidural, for vaginal births was about $200 to patients, according to analysis provided to HuffPost. My childbirth experience provides a more specific example. In many ways, it was a best-case scenario, with no major health concerns and employer-based insurance. It wound up on the low end of out-of-pocket costs, setting me back $1,527.93 — an amount that was still significant, especially combined with other pregnancy- and baby-related costs. I showed up at the hospital in the evening and within a few agonizing hours, received an epidural (for which I paid $109.38). The birth itself was uncomplicated, from a medical sense: My obstetrical care cost $292.40 out of pocket. The biggest out-of-pocket cost was the hospital stay, at $1,126.15. Without insurance, of course, this total would have been far higher: The hospital charged $25,887.42 for my total time in the hospital and $6,479.63 for the baby’s, but insurance picked up her tab. It’s tough to come up with average figures for prenatal care, but the doctor visits and tests add up. HCCI told HuffPost that, on average, patients whose costs it analyzed paid more than $1,300 out of pocket on medical costs in the nine months leading up to birth — costs that aren’t necessarily related to pregnancy, but serve as a potential proxy. We can break that down a bit more. Most patients, even relatively low-risk ones, go to many appointments. Most of my 13 prenatal appointments had low co-pays of $7.26; some, for reasons I can’t decipher, were more or less than that, bringing my all-in doctor visit cost to $162.24. I also paid $25 for the OB-GYN office to create a form for the birth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends having only one ultrasound in many cases, but it’s common to have more than that — often at least two, and I had four. On average, ultrasounds cost the patient between $60 to $70 out of pocket, HCCI found. My ultrasounds were cheaper out of pocket: Some were covered entirely, and the two that came with a bill were $23.06 and $17.91 each. Pregnant people also undergo a huge number of tests and vaccinations. They’re not very expensive — on average, routine tests cost patients less than $10, HCCI told HuffPost — but they can add up. Early in pregnancy, patients are typically tested for whether they are in fact pregnant, and then a series of other factors, including their blood type and whether they have various diseases and infections. Throughout the pregnancy, there are many more blood tests, along with a glucose screening. My tests only cost me $27.46 total, plus $8.77 for vaccinations. But that’s not counting genetic testing or other services, which can cost a patient hundreds of dollars. Those cost me $309.85. These costs all assume a low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth, which many are not. Severe morning sickness can lead to hospitalization. Six to nine percent of women develop gestational diabetes, which means more frequent testing and appointments. Restricting activity and bedrest, which is controversial but still recommended to about 20% of patients, often means time off work. At the hospital, some people are surprised with an out-of-network provider like an anesthesiologist, potentially increasing costs. Even variations on insurance and time of year can have a major effect on the out-of-pocket cost based on whether someone has already used up some of their deductible. After childbirth, the health care costs continue. Postpartum care in the U.S. is fairly lacking — many people get only one appointment at around six weeks. But postpartum issues also have a price tag, although out-of-pocket estimates are difficult given the number of variables. Some people need treatment for postpartum anxiety or depression — one in eight women suffer symptoms of postpartum depression — including appointment copays and sometimes medication. Some need postpartum physical therapy, which isn’t always covered by insurance (I had a $20 copay per appointment). To go beyond health, there are other costly factors for a pregnant or postpartum person. Most need maternity clothes. Some will need new post-baby clothes, too, given many people don’t go back to their pre-pregnancy size. There are lotions and salves for the discomfort; sitz baths for the postpartum pain; special underwear and, well, diapers for when the post-birth bleeding hasn’t stopped. Whether someone has a wanted pregnancy or one they wished to end, most of these costs are unavoidable. And then there’s the baby. Disposable diapers may run more than $900 in the first year. Child care costs have climbed to an average of over $14,000 per year during the pandemic. Breastfeeding isn’t free, as it requires various supplies and a huge amount of time; formula isn’t, either, typically running from $1,200 to $1,500 in the first year and taking up a new parent’s time and energy. Babies need clothes, a place to sleep, a stroller, a car seat and more. Let’s again set the baby aside; pretend costs related to them don’t matter. Let’s set aside the less tangible difficulties of pregnancy. Let’s set aside that a pregnancy may be unwanted. Let’s set aside the potential of major medical issues. Let’s pretend that all a pregnant person needs to worry about is finances. I’m one of the lucky ones — with employer-based insurance, relatively good health, a complication-free pregnancy and birth and a dual-income household with no other kids. And my all-in cost for medical bills alone was $2,202.22. That’s two-thirds of many Americans’ take-home pay each month. It’s more than the median listed monthly rent in the U.S. It’s equal to about four months of car payments. It’s roughly five months of groceries for the average American family. Pregnancy isn’t a health-neutral event. We shouldn’t pretend it’s a cost-neutral one, either. Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost"
16,What To Expect From Jan. 6 Panel's Third Public Hearing,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — The 1/6 committee is set to plunge into Donald Trump’s last-ditch effort to salvage the 2020 election by pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to reject the electoral count — a highly unusual and potentially illegal strategy that was set in motion in the run-up to the U.S. Capitol riot. With two live witnesses Thursday, the House panel intends to show how Trump’s false claims of a fraudulent election left him grasping for alternatives as courts turned back dozens of lawsuits challenging the vote. Trump latched onto conservative law professor John Eastman’s obscure plan and launched a public and private pressure campaign on Pence days before the vice president was to preside over the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden’s election victory. A federal judge has said it is “more likely than not” Trump committed crimes over the scheme. “The illegality of the plan was obvious,” the Jan. 6 panel said in a court filing against Eastman. The committee will hear from Greg Jacob, the vice president’s counsel who fended off Eastman’s ideas for Pence to carry out the plan; and retired federal judge Michael Luttig, who called the plan from Eastman, his former law clerk, “incorrect at every turn.” Thursday’s session is also expected to divulge new evidence about the danger Pence faced that day as the mob stormed the Capitol shouting “hang Mike Pence!” with a gallows on the Capitol grounds as the vice president fled with senators into hiding. Nine people died in the riot and its aftermath. The session is expected to show how Trump’s pressure on Pence “directly contributed” to the attack on the Capitol and how the Eastman strategy posed a “grave, grave threat” to democracy, according to a committee aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the upcoming hearing. Ahead of the hearing, Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, said his boss was determined to stay at the Capitol that night and finish the job, despite the threats. “He knew his job was to stay at his post,” Short said on CNN on Wednesday. Short said Pence didn’t want the world seeing the vice president leaving the Capitol when “a hallmark of democracy” was under siege. “He thought it was important that he stay there and make sure the work of the American people was completed that night,” said Short, who testified under subpoena to the committee for eight hours, but has not yet appeared as a live witness. The panel is reconvening for a third hearing this month after a blockbuster prime-time start last week, followed by logistical setbacks in recent days. Monday’s key witness, former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, abruptly declined to appear in person because his wife was in labor with their child. Wednesday’s scheduled hearing with witnesses from the Justice Department who tried to convince Trump that his claims of voter fraud were just not true was postponed. Nevertheless, the panel’s yearlong investigation is portraying a publicly gripping account of Trump’s final weeks in office as the defeated president clung to “the big lie” of a rigged election even as those around him — his family, his top aides, officials at the highest levels of government — were telling him he simply lost the election. Former Attorney General William Barr, who resigned at the end of 2020 rather than be part of Trump’s plans, testified earlier that the president was becoming “detached from reality” if he believed the lies. He said he told the president his claims of voter fraud were “bull-—.” With 1,000 interviews and reams of 140,000 documents, the committee is connecting the dots, showing how Trump’s false claims of election fraud became a battle cry as he summoned thousands of Americans to Washington for a Jan. 6 rally and then sent them to Capitol Hill to “fight like hell” for his presidency. More than 800 people have been arrested in the Capitol siege, and the panel is considering whether to send a referral for criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department. No president or former president has ever been indicted by the Justice Department, and Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he and his team are following the proceedings in Congress. For now, the panel is pressing ahead with its hearings, with more scheduled for next week. Thursday’s will unpack the Eastman plan to have the states send alternative slates of electors from the five or seven states Trump was disputing, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With competing slates for Trump or Biden, Pence would be forced to reject them, returning them to the states to sort it out, under the plan. Pence refused the plan, believing the founding fathers would not have left it to one person, the vice president, to decide the outcome, Jacob told the panel in previous testimony. Jacob said the idea was utterly against some 130 years of precedent in American history, “entirely made up.” The committee in hearings ahead will be delving into the roles of extremist groups and others who heeded Trump’s call to Washington. Leaders and others from the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys face rare sedition charges over their roles in the Capitol attack. Several members of Congress are also under scrutiny, including Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., whom the committee has asked for an interview to discuss a Capitol tour he gave that included basement tunnels to a group of people the day before the attack. The panel is also probing several candidates for elected office, including the Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, who were among the rioters. The panel, which is expected to deliver a final report on its findings later this year, intends for its work to be a record for history of the most violent attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. Unlike other national traumas that have pulled the country together, the Jan. 6 Capitol attack appears to have left many Americans divided. Congress splintered over forming the committee, which most Republicans opposed. The panel’s two Republicans, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, have been shunned by the GOP for their work with Democrats leading the investigation into Trump and his role in the Capitol attack. ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Farnoush Amiri in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

1,New Details Reveal How Pence And His Family Went Into Hiding On Jan. 6,politics,"  New details have surfaced about how then-Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence and other Pence family members hid from rioters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence, who reportedly was taken to a room away from the Senate floor, was photographed as he sat in a chair and as his wife closed the curtains on the pro-Donald Trump mob outside the Capitol, ABC News revealed as it showed an exclusive photo (shown here) from the day of the attack. A source told ABC News that a “worried” Karen Pence closed the curtains as she saw rioters outside the window. The photo was taken just after Pence and other family members ― including his brother, Rep. Greg Pence, and his daughter Charlotte Pence ― were taken out of the Senate chamber as the mob pushed further into the building, ABC News said. Earlier that day, then-President Donald Trump held a rally at the Ellipse in which he urged the crowd to go to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify the electoral votes that had given the presidential victory to Joe Biden, a process Pence presided over. Trump falsely told his supporters the election had been “stolen.” A number of the rioters shouted “Hang Mike Pence” as they pushed into the Capitol building. A symbolic gallows was erected on the grounds. The House select committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, disclosed that, while the riot was underway, Trump said maybe his vice president deserved to be hanged. Trump, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, wrote that he never said the phrase “Hang Mike Pence.”  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Demand For Abortion Rises As Supreme Court Is Poised To Roll Back Access,politics," Reporter, HuffPost A major trend in abortion care across the U.S. has begun to reverse, with the number of abortions performed in recent years ticking up after decades of decline, according to the Guttmacher Institute. From around 1990 through 2017, the number of abortions performed in the country showed an unmistakable downward trend. However, between 2017 and 2020, there was an 8% increase in abortions reported to Guttmacher as part of its triennial data collection effort, the group announced Wednesday. Some 930,160 abortions were reported in 2020, up from 862,320 abortions three years earlier. The rise was greatest in the West and Midwest. Guttmacher suggested several factors that may have contributed to the change, such as increased support for local abortion funds and expanded Medicaid coverage in some states. “An increase in abortion numbers is a positive development if it means people are getting the health care they want and need,” Guttmacher said in a statement. “Rather than focusing on reducing abortion, policies should instead center the needs of people and protect their right to bodily autonomy.” But the findings come at a perilous moment in the history of American reproductive health care. Based on a leaked draft of a Supreme Court majority opinion, the court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The opinion concerns a case questioning the legality of a 15-week abortion ban enacted by the state of Mississippi. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the leaked draft and said the court would find out who was responsible. The court’s final decision on the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is expected to be handed down by July 1. With a supermajority of conservative justices now on the Supreme Court, conservative states have been working to pass more and more stringent abortion laws. Texas blazed a new trail with a law banning abortion at around the six-week mark that deputizes ordinary citizens to enforce it, and other states are following suit.

3,GOP House Candidate Ryan Zinke Blows Financial Disclosure Deadline — Again,politics," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Former Trump administration official and current Republican Montana congressional candidate Ryan Zinke has for the second time in a row missed the deadline for filing a financial disclosure statement that is required of all congressional candidates. A second round of financial disclosures were due to the clerk of the House of Representatives on May 16 — a few weeks before the June 7 primary election in Montana. Zinke missed the deadline without filing a request for an extension, according to documents on the clerk’s database. As Montana’s former at-large House member, Zinke and his team should be well aware of financial disclosure rules — especially since he made headlines just last year for breaking a deadline. At that time, his campaign blamed its error on the House clerk’s office, saying it was given incorrect information that the first report was due in May 2022. Zinke’s repeated failure to follow candidate disclosure rules comes as his history of ethics scandals and lucrative post-government work for oil, gas and mining interests have taken center stage in the race for Montana’s newly created congressional seat. Zinke eked out a victory in last week’s GOP primary and will face Democrat Monica Tranel, a two-time Olympic rower and environmental lawyer, in November’s general election. On Wednesday, Tranel sent a letter calling on the U.S. attorney’s office in Montana to investigate both Zinke’s failure to file the most recent report as well as income that he reported in his first disclosure last year. “As an attorney my clients and I rely upon the fact that everyone is playing by the same set of laws, rules, and processes,” the letter states. “I urge you to please look into the actions of Mr. Zinke and hold him accountable for his failure to act.” Zinke’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The House Committee on Ethics does not comment on individual candidates’ financial disclosures; however, its instruction guide on financial reporting clearly outlines that candidates’ first disclosure statements are due within 30 days of raising $5,000 and that a second must be submitted no later than May 16, 2022. When Zinke did finally file his initial report in November, months after it was due, it revealed that he’d raked in more than $1.3 million for consulting and other services in the two years after stepping down as President Donald Trump’s interior secretary. That income included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from mining exploration company U.S. Gold Corp. and at least $5,000 each from several other fossil fuel interests. He also listed $410,000 in earnings from a “JVL Enterprises” of Dallas, but HuffPost could find no active JVL Enterprises in Dallas. A review of Texas companies with “JVL” in their names would indicate Zinke likely consulted for JVL Advisors LLC, an oil and gas investment firm in Houston. The company’s founder and managing partner, John Lovoi, sits on the board of several other fossil fuel companies, including Roan Resources, Epsilon Energy, Helix Energy Solutions and Dril-Quip. Zinke’s campaign did not previously respond to HuffPost’s request for clarification about which JVL he consulted for and the apparent error in its filing. Tranel flagged the JVL discrepancy in her Wednesday letter, writing that it “raises serious questions about the truthfulness and veracity of his previous disclosure report that should be examined.” She also noted that the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 allows the U.S. attorney general to pursue civil action against “any individual who knowingly and willfully falsifies or who knowingly and willfully fails to file” a disclosure report, with a maximum penalty of $66,190. “Fool Montanans once, shame on us. Try to fool us again, shame on scandal-plagued Ryan Zinke,” Tranel said in an email statement to HuffPost. “Zinke has lied to Montanans, lied to investigators, and lied under oath.” “No one is above the law, and every voter should question Zinke’s motives and what he’s trying to hide from voters,” she added. In her initial financial disclosure last year, Tranel reported stocks and funds worth between $2.5 million and $6.2 million and $75,000 in income between January 2020 and August 2021 from her work as an attorney. (The filings require broad ranges of financial disclosures rather than precise figures.) Her clients included several renewable energy companies. Her most recent filing, dated May 16, shows her income has remained steady — $50,000 in 2021 and $25,000 so far in 2022 — and minor changes to her total assets. Tranel’s campaign manager, Sam Sterling, acknowledged having mistakenly filed the second disclosure as an amendment to the first. At the clerk’s direction, the campaign subsequently refiled it on May 18 as a new, separate report. Both versions appear on the clerk’s disclosure database. Zinke has largely avoided having to talk about his recent work for drilling and mining interests that he spent two years regulating as head of the massive Department of the Interior. But the timing of that industry work could become a major issue ahead of the November election, as much of it occurred while he was already running for office on a pledge to lower gas prices and restore the Trump administration’s fossil fuel “energy dominance” agenda. For approximately eight months after launching his campaign in April 2021, Zinke collected a large paycheck from ConocoPhillips. Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign, said of Zinke earlier this month: “If you’re running for Congress and asking people to be for you because you want to be their servant while you are getting paid as an adviser to a profiteering oil company, there’s some question about where your allegiance lies.” Ahead of Montana’s primary, candidates on both sides of the aisle painted Zinke as a self-serving, corrupt politician. In one campaign ad, Tranel carried a snake in a shovel and said, “Growing up on a ranch in Montana, I learned how to deal with snakes. And we have a real poisonous one in Ryan Zinke.” The ad goes on to rehash the findings of a February report from the Interior Department’s internal watchdog, which concluded that Zinke violated ethics rules and misused his office with his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and that he lied to investigators about it. Zinke has repeatedly dismissed ethics probes into his conduct as political attacks and falsely claimed that they ultimately cleared him of wrongdoing. And he and his team blamed his surprisingly unimpressive performance in last week’s Republican primary on Democrats’ “fraudulent election tactics” and the negative ads that opposing candidates ran against him.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man.

9,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

10,1 Strategically Placed Protest Sign Ruins Steve Bannon's Attempt To Control Narrative,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Steve Bannon got a double whammy on Wednesday. First, a federal judge declined to dismiss the contempt of Congress charges filed against Donald Trump’s former White House adviser after he refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. U.S. District Court and Trump appointee Judge Carl Nichols ruled there was insufficient evidence the former president had asserted executive privilege to block Bannon from testifying to the committee. Nichols also rejected Bannon’s claim that internal Justice Department opinions granted him “immunity” from a congressional subpoena for documents related to his contacts with Trump while Trump was in office, saying Bannon’s team had not presented evidence that the DOJ’s opinions applied in his case. This means that Bannon’s trial could begin July 18, although one member of his team told NBC News they might seek to have it delayed. The second blow hit Bannon during a post-hearing press conference where he dubiously attacked the Jan. 6 committee because “their ratings stink and they can’t compete with the trial of Bannon.” But the bombastic Bannon’s attempt to control the narrative was thwarted, in part, by a protester whose strategically placed protest sign attempted to remind people of Bannon’s alleged role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Activist Bill Christeson managed to get his two-word sign in the same frame as Bannon in numerous photos taken at his press conference. Like here ... And here ... Christeson has made a name for himself from his pithy protests. He once held a “Traitor” sign behind Trump’s short-lived campaign manager Paul Manafort, a “Dirty Traitor” sign behind political consultant Roger Stone and a sign reading “Putin’s Puppet” behind former Trump national security adviser and Michael Flynn. The 67-year-old told HuffPost in April that getting in the right place at the right time can be “tricky.” “It’s tricky. You have to figure out where they’re going to be — what entrance they’re going in,” he explained. “You have to position yourself where the sign can easily be read next to them — and where the media can photograph it.” This video of Bannon shows Christeson in action.

11,"Herschel Walker, A Critic Of Absent Dads, Has A 2nd Son He Hadn't Disclosed",politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker, who has spoken out publicly against children being raised in fatherless homes, has a young son who he has not previously recognized publicly, his campaign confirmed Wednesday following a report of this estranged relationship. The former football star, who has received the endorsement of Donald Trump for his Georgia campaign, fathered the child “years ago when he wasn’t married,” campaign manager Scott Paradise said in a statement to HuffPost. “He’s supported the child and continues to do so. He’s proud of his children. To suggest that Herschel is ‘hiding’ the child because he hasn’t used him in his political campaign is offensive and absurd,” the statement said. The confirmation follows a report Tuesday in The Daily Beast  that the child’s mother, who has not been publicly identified, sued Walker after giving birth 10 years ago in order to secure a declaration of paternity and child support from the former NFL player. Walker, who has a 22-year-old son whom he has publicly acknowledged, has not played an active parental role in this younger son’s life, though he sends him Christmas and birthday presents, The Daily Beast reported, citing a person close to the child’s family. In a 2020 interview with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Walker called fatherless homes a “major, major problem” in Black communities and described himself as acting “like a father” to fatherless kids in the Georgia town where he grew up. “Remember, you can leave the wife, but don’t leave your child,” he said he advises young men he meets. In another 2020 interview with conservative video bloggers Diamond and Silk, Walker disparaged Black fathers who leave boys to be raised by their mother. He likened this to when Black families were separated during slavery. “Even if you have to leave that woman — you don’t leave that child,” he said. Paradise called publicity about Walker’s younger son this week a “complete double standard” while lobbing barbs against the personal life of Walker’s political opponent, first-term Sen. Raphael Warnock (D). One recent poll shows Warnock and Walker evenly tied in their Senate race. “Raphael Warnock is currently engaged in both a nasty mudslinging campaign and a nasty custody dispute with his ex-wife,” Paradise said. Warnock is currently engaged in a child custody dispute with his ex-wife over their two children and her request for child support payments to be recalculated, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Warnock’s communications director, Meredith Brasher, countered in a statement Wednesday to HuffPost that Warnock is “a devoted father who is proud to continue to co-parent his two children as he works for the people of Georgia.” News of Walker’s young son appears to be the latest instance of the aspiring politician saying one thing and doing another. Earlier this week, the AJC reported that his claims of working his entire life in law enforcement, including with a Georgia police department and as an FBI agent, are false. He has also faced questions over discrepancies about his past ownership of a poultry company as well as about his high school and college education. In addition to falsehoods, he’s faced domestic violence allegations and once talked about having a shoot-out with police, according to a 2001 police report obtained by The Associated Press.

12,The Case For Supporting A Teeny Tiny Deal On Guns,politics," Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe. David Hogg and Cameron Kasky are two of the nation’s best-known advocates for tougher gun legislation. Four years ago, both were in Parkland, Florida, when a gunman killed 17 classmates and staff at their high school. Both helped to launch and lead the student-led movement in response to that massacre. But this past week, the two reacted very differently to news of an emerging bipartisan compromise that includes a series of incremental steps — like federal support for state “red flag” laws and funding for mental health services — assembled and agreed to in the wake of last month’s elementary school massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Hogg said it was time to “celebrate” the agreement, telling Time that the proposed legislation represented “more than has ever been done in my lifetime on the federal level.” Kasky, taking to his Twitter feed, condemned the agreement as “pathetic” and a “colossal loss for the movement” ― and described claims to the contrary as “delusional.” Hogg’s description of the historical context sounds about right — this would arguably be the most signficant gun legislation since 1994, when Congress passed a now-defunct “assault weapons ban.” But it’s way short of what advocates were talking about just a few weeks ago. Plus, with a subject as politically divisive as guns ― and a negotiating cabal diverse enough to include Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) ― it’s safe to assume lawmakers will discover they have more differences, not fewer, as they work through details. That’s likely to lead to even more compromises and an even weaker bill, which is saying something. And that’s assuming the agreement even holds at all. Murphy knows this. His allies in Congress do too. Even so, they are praising the agreement and preparing to vote for it ― “resigning themselves to take a small victory,” as HuffPost’s Kevin Robillard wrote Monday, “hoping it could minimize the GOP’s fear of political blowback and pave the way for future action toward gun control.” Will their hopes be fulfilled? Is this morsel of reform worth enacting at all? It will be years before anybody can answer those questions with authority. But I can think of a few good reasons to believe this compromise will live up to the hype. Most of those reasons are related to gun violence and the potential to do something about it. But one of them is related to American democracy ― and the chance that this bill could indirectly help rescue it. First, a quick refresher on America’s gun violence problem. The U.S. is an outlier among economically advanced nations, with far higher numbers of gun-related deaths. And while that may reflect a variety of factors, including a cultural affinity for weapons, the available evidence suggests strongly that the number one cause is the sheer number of firearms in circulation. Simply put, no peer country comes close. A dramatic reduction in firearms would almost certainly produce a dramatic reduction in firearm-related deaths. But there’s no realistic chance of making that happen in the near future, because (a) the public probably wouldn’t support it (b) Congress wouldn’t vote for it (c) actually collecting all the guns in circulation would be an almost impossible task. That is why lawmakers like Murphy and groups like Giffords and Brady have focused on modest steps, like banning certain kinds of weapons or accessories, as well as tightening background checks or finding other ways of keeping guns out of the hands of people most likely to use them for violence against human beings, whether others or themselves. The newly proposed agreement — which HuffPost’s Igor Bobic covered at the time of the announcement — envisions a few very small steps in that direction. They include the ability to check juvenile records now off-limits for background checks and new funding for states that want to enact “red flag” laws that allow police to take guns away from people whose recent behavior (as certified through court proceedings) suggest they are likely to cause harm. The agreement also calls for investing in school security and mental health, as well as closing the “boyfriend loophole” that excludes unmarried partners from rules that keep guns away from people with histories of domestic violence. The boyfriend loophole (and, yes, it’s more frequently boyfriends rather than girlfriends using guns for violence) is one of those provisions that until recently got very little public attention. But gun violence experts have talked about it for years, as HuffPost’s Amanda Terkel (writing with Kevin) noted this week. And provisions already on the books in several states reduced intimate partner violence by 14% to 16%, according to a pair of studies. That might not seem like a lot, which is a running theme for the provisions under discussion. None of them are going to have singular, transformative effects. But in a country where annual firearm deaths are in the tens of thousands, a reduction of even a few percentage points can mean hundreds, even thousands, of lives saved. The main case against passing such incremental changes is political ― i.e., that it could actually set back the cause of reducing gun violence, by allowing opponents of effective measures to pretend they’ve done something meaningful and, as a result, escape accountability. It’s a reasonable argument, in principle, but it rests on the assumption that voters would punish lawmakers for blocking strong gun measures. How solid is that assumption? Strong gun reforms are extremely popular and there have certainly been times in the not-that-distant past when opponents of those reforms suffered political consequences. One reason the assault weapons ban passed in 1994 (and a law creating a new background check system passed the year before) is that Bill Clinton won the 1992 presidential election ― and one reason he won is that he repeatedly attacked his opponent, incumbent President George H.W. Bush, for blocking earlier proposals. But history since then has provided many more examples of legislators opposing gun legislation and escaping punishment for it. That includes most of the Republicans who voted against bipartisan legislation after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, even though then-President Barack Obama made that legislation the top priority for the start of his second term. (One exception was Kelly Ayotte, a GOP senator from New Hampshire whom gun law advocates targeted and who lost reelection in 2016.) Republicans normally opposed to gun legislation obviously feel some political pressure to act right now; they wouldn’t be willing to endorse even these mild steps otherwise. (Even Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell may be on board.) But to think that holding out for stronger legislation would actually produce stronger legislation is, at this point, a serious leap of faith. And there’s at least as much chance that a vote like this could be habit-forming, in the way that Democrats like Murphy have been suggesting. If there are Republicans out there genuinely interested in modest gun legislation but fearful of offending Second Amendment extremists ― and presumably there are a few ― they might feel more confident voting for future proposals, maybe even significant ones, if their support for this doesn’t cause a huge backlash. The effects could even spill over to issues beyond guns, which brings me to the point I promised about how this might all help rescue democracy. The current environment feels more and more like an existential crisis for the republic, and a big reason is the lack of more civic-minded leaders in the Republican Party ― something on vivid display over the past weeks, as GOP lawmakers have repeatedly challenged the proceedings and findings of the Jan. 6 committee. The explanation for why high-minded Republicans are so hard to find these days is something that can, has and will continue to fill books ― in other words, it’s too big a topic for this newsletter. But just like voting for sensible gun reforms might become habit-forming for a small number of Republicans, so could stepping away from the most extreme elements of the party who want to suppress votes and overturn election votes. There are obviously no guarantees that cementing the deal now under discussion would contribute toward this kind of evolution, just like there are no guarantees the deal will make a dent in gun violence. It may still be a chance worth taking. Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Antony Blinken Says He's 'Personally' Focused On Bringing Brittney Griner Home,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that it’s a personal priority for him to bring home WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia for months. “It’s something that I’m personally focused on,” Blinken told a group of LGBTQ reporters at a Wednesday roundtable at the State Department, in a show of the department’s support for Pride Month. “There’s a limit to what I can say publicly. But we are very focused on this. We are determined to bring her home.” Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who is lesbian and plays basketball in Russia during the WNBA offseason, was detained at a Moscow airport in February after local authorities claimed she was carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. They accused her of “smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance,” an offense punishable in Russia by up to 10 years in prison. Last month, the State Department reclassified Griner’s status as “wrongfully detained,” meaning the United States will work more aggressively to secure her release. Russian officials on Tuesday extended Griner’s detention for the third time. That means she will remain in Russian custody through at least July 2. During Wednesday’s roundtable, Blinken said he has spoken to Griner’s partner and his team has spoken “extensively” to Griner’s lawyers, advocates and teammates about the situation. Beyond that, he wouldn’t give details about the status of talks with Russian officials. “Just know this is a matter of intense focus for us,” he said. When asked why it took two months for the State Department to classify Griner as “wrongfully detained,” Blinken said there’s a formal process the department has to go through, and a set of specific criteria for meeting that definition. Those criteria include whether someone is being detained as a political pawn, whether someone is being held simply because he or she is an American, and whether due process is being afforded. Blinken said the department weighs all criteria before concluding if someone has been wrongfully detained overseas. “We have to follow the letter of the law,” he said. “This is a situation that we have in a multiplicity of countries. The first thing is to make a determination about whether any individual is being unjustly detained ... And that’s what we did in the case of Brittney Griner.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Federal Reserve Risks Recession In Order To Slow Inflation,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Federal Reserve is willing to risk higher unemployment if doing so can bring down prices. The Fed announced Wednesday it had hiked interest rates three quarters of a percentage point ― the largest amount since 1994. Higher interest rates put downward pressure on prices by making it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money. When people have less money to spend, there’s less demand for goods and services, meaning less incentive for firms to hike prices. If spending slumps significantly, however, companies may wind up laying off workers. People who lose their jobs spend even less, and it can become a self-reinforcing cycle ― known as a recession. “You’re destroying economic activity and constraining economic growth in order to bring down prices, but in the process of doing that you’re artificially hurting the economy,” Jin Woo Chung, senior economist at Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank, said in an interview. Nearly 70% of economists surveyed by the Financial Times this week said they expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the next year because of the Fed’s aggressive action. Higher interest rates can affect the stock market immediately but may take months to ripple through the economy. The central bank’s internal survey of its own board members and regional bank presidents, published Wednesday, indicated they expect the national unemployment rate to rise a tenth of a percentage point to 3.7% this year, 3.9% next year and 4.1% next year ― levels that do not suggest a recession. Reserve Board chair Jerome Powell has said he thinks the labor market is strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs without suffering widespread job losses. He said Wednesday that 4.1% unemployment with lower inflation would be a policy success, and insisted that the Fed doesn’t want to cause a recession. Still, some job losses are undoubtedly part of the equation. “We don’t seek to put people out of work,” Powell told reporters on Wednesday. “But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability.” Fed board member Christopher Waller suggested in a speech last month that higher interest rates would cut the number of job openings without resulting in too many layoffs. The Fed started hiking interest rates earlier this year, but picked up the pace this week in response to persistently bad monthly inflation reports. Fed officials had previously said they would continue raising rates by half a percentage point, but opted for three quarters of a percentage point Wednesday. Powell said inflation had “surprised to the upside.” Higher interest rates affect demand, but strong consumer demand has been just part of surging inflation over the past year. Powell noted that supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine, which has boosted prices for commodities such as wheat and oil, are outside of the Fed’s control. “Our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2% while the labor market remains strong,” Powell said. “I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not.” Chung criticized the Fed’s interest rate hike as a misguided response to inflation caused in large part by supply problems, arguing that a better policy would be for Congress and the White House to target corporate profiteering, since it’s corporate America that decides what prices to put on store shelves. High prices burden everyone and have cratered consumer sentiment, but layoffs are especially devastating for the smaller number of households affected. “A recession is harmful for everyone in many ways but the people who bear the larger brunt, the disproportionate harm of an economic downtown is historically the Black and brown communities and the economically disadvantaged,” Chung said.

15,Lauren Boebert Jokes Jesus Could Have Avoided Crucifixion If He'd Had AR-15s,politics," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) joked this weekend about Jesus Christ using an AR-15 assault weapon to defend himself rather than face the Crucifixion. Appearing at an event in Colorado Springs organized by the Charis Christian Center, Boebert said that “Twitter trolls” often challenge her about the contradiction between Jesus’ well-documented pacifism and her own support for gun rights. “They like to say: ‘Oh, Jesus didn’t need an AR-15. How many AR-15s do you think Jesus would have had?’” she said, to laughter in the crowd. “Well, he didn’t have enough to keep his government from killing him.” Lauren Boebert claims Jesus “didn’t have enough [AR-15s] to keep his government from killing him.” pic.twitter.com/dTC9O7ZFDz By most reckonings, it’s unlikely Jesus would have tried to resolve the situation through violence even if he’d had modern weapons with which to do so. Actually, that’s sort of the point: Christians believe Jesus chose to die on the cross to free mankind from its sins, thereby allowing believers to ascend to heaven. The Gospels ― the parts of the Bible’s New Testament that tell the story of Jesus’ life ― say Jesus allowed himself to be arrested by authorities and sentenced to death by the Roman official Pontius Pilate. When soldiers came to arrest him, Jesus told the disciple Simon Peter to put down a sword he wanted to use to defend him, and then healed the wounds Simon Peter had inflicted on a Roman soldier. “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword,” Jesus told Simon Peter, according to the Gospel of Mark. “My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight,” he told Pontius Pilate during his trial, according to the Gospel of John. Congress is in the midst of a renewed debate about gun control, following a racist massacre at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and the slaughter of more than a dozen children at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. While a bipartisan deal on gun violence is expected to attract significant GOP support in the Senate, House Republicans, including Boebert, have largely lined up against the compromise.

16,GOP Senators Stand By Election Fraud Claims That Even Bill Barr Called ‘Bulls**t’,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Republican senators who objected to the 2020 election result on Jan. 6, 2021, are standing by their votes even as several people from Donald Trump’s inner circle admitted in depositions that claims of widespread election fraud were a sham. Former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr was particularly blunt about his boss’s claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential results in testimony before the Jan. 6 select House committee, calling them “completely bullshit,” “bogus and silly,” and “crazy stuff.” “If he really believes this stuff, I thought he’d lost contact, or become detached from reality,” Barr said in a video the Jan. 6 committee aired last week. Bill Stepien, Trump’s former campaign manager, also testified that Trump ignored his advice to tell supporters on election night that it was too early to call the race. Instead, Stepien said, the former president declared outright victory that night ― even before any claims of fraud were investigated or litigated in court. But that didn’t seem to matter to top Republicans who voted to throw out millions of votes, even after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and ransacked the place. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who was the first senator to announce that he would object to the election results on Jan. 6, laughed at Barr’s statement. “I thought it was probably good for his book,” Hawley said. “His book sales probably went up.” Hawley said he stood by his objection to the Electoral College result from Pennsylvania, which he has claimed was corrupted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision allowing absentee ballots to be counted if they were received up to three days after the election. Hawley based his objection on Pennsylvania law rather than outlandish claims of fraud ― which have never had any credibility ― but on Wednesday he left open the possibility that fraud could have swung the election. “If you want to ask me if there’s enough fraud to change the outcome of the election, we’ll never know the answer,” he said. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who lodged the first objection to Arizona’s electoral results, said that “voter fraud has been a persistent problem in this country” when asked to respond to Barr flatly slapping down 2020 election fraud claims. Asked whether he regretted voting to object to the electoral results, Cruz mocked the question. “Do [I] have any regrets over fighting to enhance voter integrity and protect our democracy? No, I do not have regrets over fighting to defend our democracy,” he told HuffPost. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), the former Alabama college football coach, cast his first-ever vote in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, to challenge the 2020 election results. He, too, said he disagreed with Barr and stood behind his vote. “You can’t say it was zero fraud. You can’t do that,” Tuberville said. “I don’t care whether you’re a former attorney general or just a citizen of the United States. In every election, you got problems. You just don’t know how far it went.” There was no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 election. While a recount could have potentially shifted some votes, Joe Biden’s victory was so large it would not have been enough to swing the election to Trump’s favor, according to former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt, who made election calls for the network. “He needed three of these states to change,” Stirewalt said in testimony before the Jan. 6 committee earlier this week. “And in order to do that, I mean, you’re better off to play the Powerball than to have that come in.” The “big lie” is continuing to loom over the 2022 and 2024 elections, with scores of Republican candidates running for state and federal office who say the 2020 election was rigged. In Nevada for example, the GOP candidates for U.S. Senate and Nevada’s secretary of state are both election denialists.

1,John Hinckley Jr. Freed From Court Oversight,politics," NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — John Hinckley Jr., who shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, was freed from court oversight Wednesday, officially concluding decades of supervision by legal and mental health professionals. “After 41 years 2 months and 15 days, FREEDOM AT LAST!!!,” he wrote on Twitter shortly after 12 p.m. The lifting of all restrictions had been expected since late September. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington said he’d free Hinckley on June 15 if he continued to remain mentally stable in the community in Virginia where he has lived since 2016. Hinckley, who was acquitted by reason of insanity, spent the decades before that in a Washington mental hospital. Hinckley’s restrictions were gradually loosened over the years, including the lifting of limits on his social media use. Hinckley’s following on social media has grown to nearly 30,000 followers on Twitter and YouTube over the past several months. Freedom for Hinckley will include giving a concert — he plays guitar and sings — in Brooklyn, New York, that’s scheduled for July. But the graying 67-year-old is far from being the household name that he became after shooting and wounding the 40th U.S. president — and several others — outside a Washington hotel. Today, historians say Hinckley is at best a question on a quiz show and someone who unintentionally helped build the Reagan legend and inspire a push for stricter gun control. “If Hinckley had succeeded in killing Reagan, then he would have been a pivotal historical figure,” H.W. Brands, a historian and Reagan biographer, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. “As it is, he is a misguided soul whom history has already forgotten.” Barbara A. Perry, a professor and director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, said that Hinckley “would be maybe a Jeopardy question.” But his impact remains tangible in Reagan’s legacy. “For the president himself to have been so seriously wounded, and to come back from that — that actually made Ronald Reagan the legend that he became ... like the movie hero that he was,” Perry said. Friedman, the federal judge overseeing Hinckley’s case, said on June 1 that Hinckley has shown no signs of active mental illness since the mid-1980s and has exhibited no violent behavior or interest in weapons. “I am confident that Mr. Hinckley will do well in the years remaining to him,” the judge said during the hearing earlier this month. He noted that lawyers for the government and Hinckley have fought for years over whether Hinckley should be given increasing amounts of freedom. “It took us a long time to get here,” he said, adding there is now unanimous agreement: “This is the time to let John Hinckley move on with his life, so we will.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Small Businesswoman Tears Up Describing Child Care Woes To Congressional Panel,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost A working mom gave lawmakers a raw reminder on Wednesday of the importance of child care and paid leave, tearing up as she described her struggle to care for her autistic son. Tori Snyder, a Pittsburgh mother to a 4 1/2-year-old boy named Braxton, was asked at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about the difficulties of pulling together a patchwork of child care and other resources as a small business owner. “I have to make sure that I secure contract after contract, often taking more on than necessary because of the fear and the worry that there’s not going to be enough money,” Snyder told the lawmakers. “What if one contract ends? What if we hit another [COVID-19] episode? What if we hit a recession?” She said she would like to go back to working a more stable corporate job with good benefits, but that often those jobs don’t allow the flexibility she needs. “As someone who’s dedicated 15 years to corporate America, I’m more than happy to be that reliable and accountable person. But my human, my son? He doesn’t have anyone else to take care of him” she said, beginning to tear up. “If I have to choose between working 40 hours to have health benefits or having to work 90 hours in my small business around my son’s schedule in order to be there for him, making sure he can access the services that he needs, I’ll deal with the stress every day,” she continued. “And that’s why the paid leave for all is so important.” Democrats have pushed for broader child care and paid leave, but the effort stalled under Republican opposition. Democrats argued such legislation would help parents like Snyder, who is a member of the advocacy group MomsRising, which focuses on issues of concern to women, mothers and families. According to Snyder’s written testimony, her business, Self-Care Senorita, offers presentations on self-care and productivity. Snyder also works as a business coach and diversity, equity and inclusion consultant. In her testimony, Snyder said she had worked in the film industry for several years but left it just before the onset of the COVID pandemic because of unpredictable hours. A new venture, contracting for non-profit organizations, foundered because of the pandemic, she said. “A lot of single moms are isolated and alone, trying to handle everything ourselves,” Snyder said. “We are burned out and exhausted, overworked and overtired. And we’re struggling even more now because it’s so expensive to feed our kids and put gas in our cars. With paid leave, I would know that if I have to take a day off, we won’t go into debt.” Republicans on the committee said they worried paid leave for all would be cumbersome for businesses by using a one-size-fits-all approach, and would end up as a corporate giveaway. Rep. Dave Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said if Democrats were serious about working with Republicans on child care and leave issues, they would huddle with them and economists from both sides to come up with ideas. “Instead we’ve become nothing but sort of political talking points for the next video clip for the next election,” Schweikert said. “And we’re better than that.” The Build Back Better Act passed by the House 2021 would have provided free child care for kids under the age of six, as well as free universal pre-school services. It also would have provided up to four weeks of paid family and medical leave annually. It passed the House on a 220-213 vote, with no Republicans voting in favor.

3,House Panel Passes Bill Meant To Stop Census Misinformation,politics," A U.S. House committee approved a bill Wednesday that would outlaw the distribution of fake or misleading materials resembling census forms or other materials that could prevent people from participating in the nation’s head count. The Democratic-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent the measure to the House floor with the aim of stopping the spread of misinformation related to the once-a-decade census. Violators would be receive civil penalties. Months before the most recent census started in March 2020, the Republican National Committee sent out mailers that mimicked the look of a U.S. census form and solicited donations for President Donald Trump’s reelection. At the time, the Republican National Committee said the mailers were clearly marked as being from the GOP. Officials in Montana issued a warning about the mailers, saying they could confuse people into thinking they had filled out the census form when they hadn’t done so. “No one should use the census to confuse or deceive people for any reasons,” said U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York who chairs the oversight committee. Republicans on the committee said the legislation was unnecessary since there are already laws that criminalize fraud. “It’s duplicative and unnecessary,” said U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off.

5,Sen.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said.

Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

10,Biden Seeks To Counter States' Anti-LGBTQ Actions,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden issued an executive order Wednesday to stymie what what he called discriminatory legislative attacks on the LGBTQ community by Republican-controlled states, declaring before a signing ceremony packed with activists, “pride is back at the White House.” The order seeks to discourage “conversion therapy” — a discredited practice that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity — while also promoting gender-affirming surgery and expanding foster care protections for gay and transgender parents and children. Tapping money already allocated to federal agencies rather than requiring new funding, Biden said the order is meant to counter 300-plus anti-LGBTQ laws introduced by state lawmakers over the past year alone. The Department of Health and Human Services will draft new policies to expand care to LGBTQ families and the Education Department will devise rules to better protect LGBTQ students in public schools. The president, first lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended a crowded reception in the White House’s East Room, where the adjacent hallway was decorated in rainbow colors. Attending were LGBTQ activists, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress, and top administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who adopted twins with his husband, Chasten. The gathering is part of the Biden administration’s recognition of Pride Month. “All of you in this room know better than anyone that these attacks are real and consequential for real families,” the president said before sitting to sign the order. He pointed specifically to the arrest last weekend of 31 members of the white supremacist group Patriot Front near an Idaho pride event. Actions listed within the order attempt to bolster programs better addressing the issue of suicide among LGBTQ children and seek to make adoptions easier for LGBTQ parents and children. “It shouldn’t take courage to be yourself,” said Jill Biden, who noted that it was a little too hot and humid in summer sun-drenched Washington to hold the event on the South Lawn. “We know that, in places across the country like Florida or Texas or Alabama, rights are under attack. And we know that in small towns and big cities, prejudice, and discrimination still lurk.” Among the state laws the White House has opposed is the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” measure in Florida, which was signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March. It bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Critics say it marginalizes LGBTQ people, and the law sparked a public battle between the state and the Walt Disney Co. Biden’s action creates a federal working group to help combat LGBTQ homeless and one promoting educational policies for states and school districts that encourage inclusive learning environments for LGBTQ children. His order also establish new rules to discourage conversion therapy, though efforts to enforce bans against it in places where state law allows the practice will rely on legal challenges from outside the White House. While some Republican-led legislatures have championed conversation therapy, other states and communities have banned it. The American Psychological Association says conversation therapy is not based on science and is harmful to a participant’s mental health. The order further directs health officials to spell out that federally funded programs cannot be used to fund conversion therapy. And it seeks to ease barriers to health care and certain types of treatment for the LGBTQ community, including gender affirming surgery. That follows Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s February order directing Texas’ child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse. A judge has since issued a restraining order that halted investigations into three families, and prevented others. “We have a lot more work to do,” Biden said. “In Texas, knocking on front doors to harass and investigate parents who are raising transgender children. In Florida, going after Mickey Mouse for God’s sake.” In earlier orders, Biden has sought to direct that gay and transgender people are protecting from discrimination in schools, health care, housing and at work. He ordered federal agencies to update and expand regulations prohibiting sexual discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and reversed a ban on transgender people serving in the military. Biden on Wednesday also renewed his calls for Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would amend existing civil rights law to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identification as protected characteristics. The measure has been stalled on Capitol Hill but the president said it’s necessary to “enshrine the long overdue civil rights protections of all Americans, every American.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,New Video Shows Trump Rally Attendees Scoping Out Capitol Day Before Jan. 6 Attack,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― New footage released by the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection shows members of a tour group hosted by a Republican lawmaker taking pictures of Capitol complex hallways and making menacing comments about members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police said this week that it did not consider the tour group’s activity “suspicious.” But the Jan. 6 committee renewed its previous request for Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), who led the tour, to provide more information. The video shows people in the group taking pictures on Jan. 5 in the basement hallways of the Longworth and Cannon House office buildings, which are connected to the Capitol by a tunnel. The committee has suggested the group might have been conducting reconnaissance for the next day’s riot. “Individuals on the tour photographed and recorded areas of the complex not typically of interest to tourists, including hallways, staircases and security checkpoints,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol, wrote in a Wednesday letter to Loudermilk. The committee’s video also includes Jan. 6 footage of members of the same tour group marching toward the Capitol after a speech by President Donald Trump. It does not show members of the group entering the Capitol that day. The committee released the material the day before its third public hearing. Last week the committee began a series of hearings to present the evidence it has gathered over nearly a year of investigating the Capitol riot. The hearings so far have presented the riot as the culmination of a brazen conspiracy to steal the 2020 election, one that many members of Trump’s campaign and his administration described in the committee’s depositions as unjustified and even “bullshit.” In the footage from the march toward the Capitol, some of the people in Loudermilk’s group made what the committee called “disturbing threats” against members of Congress. “There’s no escape,” one man says in the video, before mentioning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). “We’re coming for you.” Surveillance footage shows a tour led by Loudermilk to areas in the House Office Buildings, as well as the entrances to Capitol tunnels.Individuals on the tour photographed/recorded areas not typically of interest to tourists: hallways, staircases and security checkpoints. pic.twitter.com/Rjhf2BTdbc The Capitol Police said this week that the group’s behavior in the Capitol complex did not raise security concerns. “At no time did the group appear in any tunnels that would have led them to the U.S. Capitol,” Capitol Police chief Thomas Manger wrote in a letter to Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), the top Republican on the House Administration Committee. “There is no evidence that Representative Loudermilk entered the U.S. Capitol with this group on January 5, 2021,” Manger wrote. “We train our officers on being alert for people conducting surveillance or reconnaissance, and we do not consider any of the activities we observed as suspicious.” Like other House Republicans, Loudermilk has refused to cooperate with the Jan. 6 committee. He said the Capitol Police letter essentially cleared him of wrongdoing because he “never gave a tour of the Capitol” itself, just the House office buildings. In his letter to Loudermilk on Wednesday, Thompson suggested the committee had wanted to show the video to the Republican privately, but released it publicly in the interest of getting him to answer questions. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) said on Twitter he thought the tour group’s photography was indeed unusual. “This is the stairwell I take to my office,” Boyle said. “In my 8 yrs here, I have never seen a tourist taking a picture of it. “ This is the stairwell I take to my office. In my 8 yrs here, I have never seen a tourist taking a picture of it. #January6thCommittee https://t.co/SuZV4w5GPD Loudermilk tweeted his response Wednesday, calling it a “smear campaign” and saying that there were “ongoing death threats to myself, my family, and my staff.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Supreme Court Shies Away From Attacking Regulatory State In Medicare Case,politics," Reporter, HuffPost The Supreme Court rejected a prescription drug reimbursement rule instituted by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2018 in a narrow decision unlikely to have broader implications for the regulatory state. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the unanimous decision in American Hospital Association v. Becerra. While the case decreases the amount of discretion courts will give to agencies implementing new regulations, the case threatened to fully upend the federal regulatory state, as the justices were asked to overturn a nearly 40-year-old precedent providing that discretion. The court, however, did not take up the suggestion to overturn its precedents governing the regulatory state. Instead, it ruled that HHS simply did not have the authority under existing laws to change reimbursement rates for a specific type of hospital. The case originated from a decision by HHS in 2018 to update the prescription drug reimbursement payment total for certain hospitals after discovering that those hospitals were receiving reimbursements far in excess of the amounts they originally paid for drugs. In 2003, Congress passed legislation adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare that provided two options for how to reimburse hospitals for their purchases of drugs for Medicare patients. One option allowed Medicare to survey hospitals for their prescription drug acquisition costs and then reimburse hospitals for “average acquisition costs,” with different payments allowed for different hospitals. The other option said Medicare could reimburse the “average price” for each drug with the “average price” set at 106% of a drug’s sale price. Medicare chose the second option due to the difficulty in surveying hospitals. But the second option increased costs by incentivizing hospitals to purchase more expensive drugs even when less expensive generics were available. “Because 6% of a large number is bigger than 6% of a small number, hospitals have an incentive to dispense more expensive drugs, even when there are cheaper and equally effective therapies,” Nicholas Bagley, professor at the University of Michigan Law School, wrote at SCOTUSblog ahead of court arguments. This payment structure created an even greater incentive for certain hospitals serving disadvantaged communities. Those hospitals receive substantial prescription drug discounts between 20% and 50% under Medicare’s 340B program. But the reimbursement program still pays these hospitals 106%, meaning these hospitals receive somewhere between a 26% and 56% subsidy on drug purchases. In 2018, Medicare sought to fix this unexpected subsidy for 340B hospitals by lowering its drug reimbursement percentage to them from 106% to 77.5%. These hospitals and a collection of hospital trade associations, including the American Hospital Association, challenged this rule change in court by arguing that Congress had not provided the agency with the specific authority to alter its drug reimbursement program. This is where the challenge ran into the 1984 precedent in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council giving agencies broad deference to interpret statutes passed by Congress when setting rules and regulations. The Chevron deference has come under fire from conservative jurists in recent years as they seek to restrain federal regulatory authority. Lower courts found that Medicare should be provided deference under the Chevron precedent to set prescription drug reimbursement rates, but the Supreme Court did not address the Chevron claim. It instead simply ruled that the existing Medicare prescription drug law did not allow the change “absent a survey of hospitals’ acquisition costs.” “The text and structure of the statute make this a straightforward case,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Because HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals’ acquisition costs, HHS acted unlawfully by reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.” While the ruling here did not disrupt existing precedent on regulatory matters, the court is still set to rule on the issue again in June in the West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency case. Conservative justices have increasingly questioned the precedent in recent years with Justice Neil Gorsuch taking the lead since he joined the bench in 2017. But Gorsuch, and other opponents of agency regulatory deference, may have found another way to gut the federal regulatory state with their expansion of the so-called major questions doctrine. That doctrine supposedly states that any agency action of “vast economic and political significance” will not receive deference from the courts unless explicitly authorized by Congress in legislation. The court may expand its major questions doctrine when it rules in the West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency case over not-yet-written carbon emission regulations.

13,"Mitch McConnell Says He Could Support Bipartisan Senate Gun Deal, Calls It 'Progress'",politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he would support the bipartisan Senate deal on gun reform “if the legislation ends up reflecting what the framework indicates,” calling it “progress for the country” after a recent string of mass shootings. Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators that includes 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans reached an agreement with provisions to expand background checks for those under 21 and a commitment to provide funding to schools for mental health. McConnell said he hoped the framework agreed upon could be turned into legislation that the Senate could pass. “For myself, I’m comfortable with the framework, and if the legislation ends up reflecting what the framework indicates, I’ll be supportive,” McConnell said. On Sunday, the group of senators released a statement announcing what they called a “commonsense proposal” on gun safety. “Families are scared, and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities,” the statement stated. McConnell said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who McConnell tapped to lead GOP negotiators, showed Republican senators a poll of only gun owners that demonstrated support for the measures included in the deal is “off the charts.” “I think if this framework becomes the actual piece of legislation, it’s a step forward, a step forward on a bipartisan basis and further demonstrates to the American people that we can come together, which we have done from time to time on things like infrastructure and postal reform, to make progress for the country,” McConnell told reporters. McConnell said the senators did their best to garner “total support” for their deal and specifically mentioned the background check enhancement for those under 21 as “a step in the right direction.” McConnell is among the members of Congress with the highest contributions from gun groups, according to Axios. In the aftermath of another mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, that killed seven people in 2019, when the GOP was still in the Senate majority, McConnell said he would only bring gun control legislation to the Senate floor if President Donald Trump supported it. In the past, McConnell has stood in the way of getting gun control legislation passed, according to NBC News. In the wake of a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 59 people, the Kentucky Republican said “the investigation has not even been completed. And I think it’s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.” McConnell also campaigned on gun rights in 2013, a few months after the tragic Sandy Hook school shooting, issuing a robocall attacking President Barack Obama’s proposals on gun safety. The current bipartisan deal also includes a provision to close the “boyfriend loophole.” Currently, federal law bans only those convicted of abusing their spouses or a person with whom they have a child from obtaining firearms. Closing this loophole would extend that ban to all convicted stalkers and abusers. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) is credited with pushing for the reform to be included in the framework. The deal will also include incentives for states that pass red flag laws, which would bar individuals that are deemed a danger to themselves or others from purchasing firearms. This “is going to be a bill with a lot of money for law enforcement, schools and mental health,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told CNN Tuesday. “All of that money will be eligible for states, whether they pass red flag laws or not. We have a specific incentive fund, though, for states that do choose to pass red flag laws.” Murphy, who is leading Democrats in the negotiations, added they are hoping to vote on the deal before the Senate goes on recess for July 4. The legislation still hasn’t been written. “Our agreement is based on principles alone and translating this proposal into legislative language is no easy task, as members of the Senate understand,” Cornyn said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Still, if passed, the deal would represent the biggest change on guns in decades. Momentum for the agreement was created after a string of deadly mass shootings, including at a school in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers.

14,Woodward And Bernstein Compare Nixon And Trump — And Guess Who's Worse,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Famous reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein compared former presidents Richard Nixon and Donald Trump on “The Late Show” Tuesday ― and only Trump emerged as “first seditious president of the United States.” (Watch the video below.) The “All the President’s Men” authors visited host Stephen Colbert to mark the 50th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, but the conversation turned to the problematic reigns of both Nixon and Trump. The former eventually resigned after it was discovered (thanks in part to Woodward and Bernstein) that he led a coverup of the June 17, 1972, burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex to dig up dirt on the opposition party and plant bugs. The latter has been accused of fomenting a coup to overturn the 2020 election, and a House committee is attempting to assert his criminal responsibility. “It is a crime,” Woodward said. Bernstein noted that Trump “went farther” to attack democracy. “Richard Nixon was a criminal president who tried to undermine the very basis of our democracy, the electoral system,” Bernstein began. “Then you have Donald Trump, who also tried to undermine the electoral system but went farther. He staged a coup to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to the duly elected successor Joe Biden, who was elected fairly and freely. And then we have in this coup attempt the first seditious president of the United States.” “We had a coup staged by a president the likes of what you see in juntas, the likes of what you see in authoritarian regimes,” he added.

15,"Election 2022 Takeaways: Big Trump Win, Nev. Senate Race Set",politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump notched a significant victory in South Carolina, where his preferred candidate easily ousted five-term Rep. Tom Rice, the first Republican to be booted from office after voting to impeach the former president last year. But another high-profile GOP target of Trump in the state, Rep. Nancy Mace, managed to hold back a challenger. Meanwhile, in Nevada on Tuesday, Trump’s pick, Adam Laxalt, won his U.S. Senate primary, defeating a populist candidate who is arguably more representative of the Trump base. Takeaways from the latest round of primary elections: Rice and Mace have been objects of Trump’s anger ever since a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election win. Their transgressions? Mace stated on national TV that Trump’s “entire legacy was wiped out” by the attack, while Rice became an apostate for joining a small group of Republicans who voted with Democrats in favor of Trump’s second impeachment. “He threw a temper tantrum that culminated with the sacking of the United States Capitol,” Rice told NBC News on Monday. “It’s a direct attack on the Constitution, and he should be held accountable.” Voters ultimately rendered different judgments on the duo, reflecting a split within the GOP about how to move forward from the Trump era. Rice’s largely rural district is representative of Trump’s America, where crossing the former president carries a steep cost. Even as Trump railed against both lawmakers, he chose to hold a rally in Rice’s district earlier this year. That’s because Mace’s district, which centers on Charleston, is full of the type of moderate suburban voters who fled the GOP under Trump. It is one of the few districts in an overall red state where Democrats have been even moderately competitive in congressional races. The results demonstrate that the Trump factor can’t be underestimated in solidly Republican territory, a potential warning sign for other Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who also voted to impeach Trump and has helped lead the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack. She’s facing a competitive primary in August from a Trump-backed challenger. Another notable factor in the Mace contest: It amounted to a proxy battle between Trump, who is contemplating a 2024 White House campaign, and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is also considering a run. Trump backed former state Rep. Katie Arrington in the race, while Haley, a former South Carolina governor, effectively challenged Trump by campaigning with Mace. Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell don’t agree on much. One rare exception is Laxalt, who won Nevada’s Republican Senate primary. The two Republican leaders haven’t been on speaking terms since December 2020, when McConnell acknowledged that Biden defeated Trump. But they both endorsed Laxalt, who defeated retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, a West Point graduate and Purple Heart recipient who ran an unexpectedly strong campaign as a conservative outsider. The mutual support, which brought together the Trump and establishment wings of the party, demonstrates the intense focus Republican have placed on flipping the seat held by first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is considered among the most vulnerable senators. A once solidly Democratic district in South Texas will now be represented by a Republican after Mayra Flores won a special primary election to finish the term of former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who resigned this year to become a lobbyist. Flores, a GOP organizer who is the daughter of migrant workers, will only hold the seat for several months before the district is redrawn to be more favorable to Democrats. But her victory in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley is an ominous sign for Democrats. They are not only losing ground in a region they long dominated, but Flores’ success as a candidate also demonstrates that Republicans are making inroads with Hispanic voters. Her win also has implications for Democrats’ ambitions in Congress, denying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi an opportunity to add to her slim two-vote margin to pass legislation. Also in South Carolina, Republican Tim Scott coasted to an easy and unopposed primary win Tuesday for what he says will be his last term in the Senate. But another state is also on his mind — the presidential proving ground of Iowa. It’s become an article of faith that there are no “accidental” trips to Iowa by ambitious politicians. And Scott, the Senate’s sole Black Republican, has made several visits, including one last week. He certainly has the money to contend. As he campaigned for reelection to the Senate, Scott amassed a jaw-dropping $42 million. That’s more than double the $15.7 million average cost of a winning Senate campaign in the 2018 midterms. It’s also more than enough to launch a Republican presidential campaign in 2024. Even before his recent appearance at an Iowa Republican Party event, Scott has been raising his profile. He spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention and delivered the Republican response to President Joe Biden’s first joint congressional address. He’s also visited New Hampshire, another early-voting presidential state, and delivered a speech at the Reagan Presidential Library, another frequent stop for Republicans eyeing the White House. Governor’s races are often overlooked. But the general election contest in Maine is among a handful of governor’s races that are likely to be competitive this year, along with Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona. Tuesday’s gubernatorial primaries were a mere formality, since the races were uncontested. But they locked in what promises to be a doozy of a general election between two longtime foes. Democratic incumbent Janet Mills is seeking a second term. She’s a former district attorney, state lawmaker and Maine attorney general who frequently clashed with Republican Paul LePage when he was governor. Now LePage, who has described himself as “Trump before there was Trump,” is challenging her. The contest will test the appeal of Trumpian candidates in New England. The Democratic Governors Association has already booked $5 million in TV ad time. That Mills and LePage are even competing against each other is somewhat of a surprise. LePage moved to Florida and swore off politics when he left office in 2019 following two raucous terms that often drew national attention for his indecorous remarks. But the draw of elected office was apparently too great. By 2020, he was back in Maine pledging to challenge his old nemesis. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics.

16,Abortion Funds Will Matter More Than Ever In A Post-Roe America,politics," Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. For plenty of people, securing an appointment for an abortion with a real health care provider is difficult enough. On top of that, many do not live in places where abortion is accessible, and have to decide whether to pay for gas or pay for a flight, and possibly a hotel room for one or more nights. Many people seeking abortions have small children, so there is also the question of child care. Then there is the cost of the actual medical service, which averages upward of $500 for an in-clinic procedure in much of the country. Waiting means it will cost more. When all of those costs added up appear daunting, an abortion fund can step in. All over the country, abortion funds are staffed by people ready to help others figure out how to get an abortion, supplying grants in varying amounts to help cover the cost of the appointment as well as expenses like transportation, child care and shelter during recovery. The funds make it possible for women, including many women of color, to secure an abortion either by medication (in the form of pills) or by a clinician in an office. Some travel hundreds or thousands of miles. Some have no insurance, while others are covered by Medicaid or private insurance. At least one fund, the Brigid Alliance, has helped a 10-year-old child access abortion care. Another, the Midwest Access Coalition, will work to link people who aren’t near major airports with private flights so they can get the care they need. Every fund HuffPost spoke with said they are already gearing up to field more requests in the months ahead by hiring new full-time staff, training more volunteers and soliciting funding as the Supreme Court appears poised to roll back nationwide abortion access in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Many states in the South, West and Midwest would be certain or likely to prohibit abortion in the absence of Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute. States that have passed laws protecting the right to abortion ― such as California and Illinois ― could then expect to see even more out-of-state travelers seeking health care services there. Some abortion funds have been around for decades. Even though the Supreme Court made the practice legal with its 1973 decision in the case of Roe v. Wade, subsequent decisions have permitted conservative states to stick medically unnecessary roadblocks in the path of abortion access. The laws have steadily chipped away at Roe and shut down clinics, meaning that the nearest facility for some may be hundreds of miles away ― and not all clinics will provide an abortion if it is needed later in pregnancy. Because of these attacks from state legislatures, some abortion rights activists say that millions of Americans have already been living in a post-Roe America. A Texas woman who received assistance from the Chicago Abortion Fund told HuffPost that she found herself surrounded by other Texans when she arrived for an appointment in Illinois earlier this year. In September, Texas enacted a near-total ban that prohibits abortion once electrical activity can be detected in the fetus, which is usually at around six weeks ― before many women know they are pregnant. Other states are following suit. The woman, like many abortion seekers, was a parent already: mother to a 2-year-old girl. Workers at the Texas clinic she used to confirm her pregnancy tried to convince her not to seek an abortion. “They even brought people in to pray for me,” she said. HuffPost is not using her name to protect her privacy. “My mind was made up. I don’t want to bring anybody into this world that I know I cannot take care of physically or mentally. I want to be well prepared. I want to be financially prepared,” she said, adding: “It’s so much going on right now in the world.” She ended up needing to ask for assistance twice within a year. While she felt “just really nervous” the second time, she said, she faced no judgment. She insisted on paying for more of her own costs on her return visit to the clinic, where she encountered one of the same staffers who helped her the first time. “She just opened her arms,” she said of the staffer, “and I can’t thank her enough.” The woman told HuffPost that two other people she met at the clinic had lost their jobs for taking time off to get an abortion. Qudsiyyah Shariyf, deputy director of the Chicago Abortion Fund, described abortion funds as a type of mutual aid, like the many community-based organizations that sprung up in response to the coronavirus pandemic. CAF was able to spend around $500,000 last year in direct aid, Shariyf said. But she noted that stigma surrounding abortion is still a “real barrier” to securing funding and providing help. While some run their operations with grants from larger organizations, grassroots support is critical to sustaining many of the funds. Requests are managed by a mix of staff and volunteers, depending on the group, and there may be certain times of day or days of the week that they respond to messages. Generally, it’s fine to book an appointment first, tell the clinic you think you will need financial assistance, and allow them to refer you to abortion funds. You can also reach out to funds on your own. The National Network of Abortion Funds cautions that it’s unlikely the total cost of the procedure will be completely covered. CAF, for example, averages around $100 to $300 per person helped, Shariyf said. The New Orleans Abortion Fund averaged around $300 per person helped last year, according to its annual report. Some of the groups, such as the Women’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project ― which bills itself as the largest national abortion fund ― work directly with the hospital, doctor or clinic providing the abortion. Sylvia Ghazarian, WRRAP’s executive director, told HuffPost her organization works with 700 health care providers around the country and recently launched a pilot program to increase access to medication abortion, which costs just $150 through the program. Last year, WRRAP sent about $600,000 to clinics in order to assist around 3,000 patients, Ghazarian said. Demand is only expected to grow. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that California could see 3,000% more patients, and Illinois could see 9,000% more in the absence of Roe. “We’re having more and more people referred these days who don’t have appointments for weeks out because clinics are getting so booked up,” Brigid Alliance executive director Odile Schalit said. The Midwest Access Coalition said in its most recent annual report, for 2021, that it was “no longer uncommon” for the group to fly an abortion-seeker to a facility for a one-day procedure. Schalit said that Brigid’s assistance can include “booking flights, bus tickets, train tickets, booking hotels for you for you and your family if the situation arises that you have to travel with them, sending cash for meals, child care reimbursements, gas, tolls, parking, tire repairs and connecting and coordinating any on-the-ground, in-person volunteer support that you might need.” She added: “For instance, if you don’t have a cell phone from which you can use a Lyft gift card, we might send that to you.” While the organizations strive to do the most with the resources they have, there are still significant needs not being met, according to the National Network of Abortion Funds. As MAC’s year-end report noted, “We are heading into a difficult era for reproductive autonomy and justice.” “I just want [people] to do what they think is best for them,” the Texas woman told HuffPost. “I feel like it’s very unfair for them to tell us what we can and can’t do with our bodies.” For a state-by-state list of more than 80 organizations, along with links to donate, head to NNAF’s website.

1,The Looming Reversal Of Roe v. Wade Is Another Perilous Sign For American Democracy,politics," Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. Globally, abortion rights and access have broadly expanded in the 50 years since the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade made the practice legal in the United States. But a small number of countries have moved in the opposite direction, especially in the last decade, seeking to outlaw abortions, harden existing bans, or enacting new restrictions. These nations ― countries like Brazil, El Salvador, Hungary, India, Nicaragua and Poland ― share one major commonality: They are almost exclusively countries that experts consider “backsliding democracies,” in which abortion access is one of many rights under threat. Now, the United States ― itself now widely considered a democracy in decline ― is about to join them. Later this month, the Supreme Court is expected to fully overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A decision that follows the contours of the draft opinion that leaked in early May would have dire consequences for reproductive rights, likely making abortion illegal or heavily restricted in nearly half of all states. Much as in those other nations, the attack on abortion rights is not occurring in a political vacuum: It is on the brink of success thanks to the same dynamics causing the United States’ own democratic backsliding. Roe is under threat thanks to a conservative political project that has made a mission of targeting the basic individual rights democracies by definition protect, and because the country’s increasingly undemocratic political system has disproportionately advantaged political minority rule and fueled its radicalization. Roe’s demise is inseparable from the larger democratic crisis facing the country: It is yet another perilous sign for the future of not just reproductive freedoms but of American democracy as a whole. “This does not track with what democracies do,” said Sophia Jordán Wallace, a University of Washington political scientist who has studied the relationship between abortion rights and democracy. “Democracies have been expanding access to abortion, and accepting that this is part of health care and part of people having control over their own bodies and health. It’s really alarming.” Efforts to restrict abortion rights have generally gone coincided with broader attempts to undermine democracy. In Poland, a court decision that almost totally outlawed abortion occurred alongside a larger erosion of fundamental rights under the governing Law and Justice Party. Right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has waged an unrelenting assault on his country’s democracy since taking office in 2019, and is openly plotting ways to undermine upcoming presidential elections. Abortion is broadly illegal in Brazil, but Bolsonaro has sought to limit access even further. In August 2020, a 10-year-old girl attempted to get an abortion to end a pregnancy that resulted from her repeated rape by a relative. Brazil allows abortions in instances of rape or incest, but she was rejected at the hospital nearest to her home and forced to obtain a court order to go forward with the procedure. Conservative anti-abortion activists published her name online, and she faced threats and criticism, even from prominent officials within Bolsonaro’s government. Similar cases in other Latin American countries have kick-started movements to expand abortion access and bolster women’s rights more broadly, but in Brazil, the 10-year-old’s plight generated a surge in efforts to block abortions. The number of legislative proposals seeking to limit access to abortion, which had already increased dramatically under Bolsonaro, rose even further. Bolsonaro’s government, meanwhile, issued an order requiring doctors to report legal abortion procedures to police. The United States is generally considered a more established democracy than countries like Brazil and Poland, nations that transitioned to democratic governance in the 1980s and 1990s. But Roe v. Wade occurred in the midst of a rapid period of American democratization, as the United States transformed itself from a partial democracy into one that attempted to include and represent all ― or at least most ― of its citizenry. The decision was handed down 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education ruled school segregation unconstitutional and less than a decade after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed much of Jim Crow and vastly expanded the rights of Black Americans. It came in the midst of a stop-and-start push for women’s rights: Roe followed failed efforts to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution and the successful passage of Title IX. It occurred alongside the spread of feminist protests that led to laws addressing violence against women. It preceded the first statutes outlawing marital rape, which is now illegal in all 50 states. Its downfall is occurring during a similarly rapid period of reversal. The Supreme Court gutted key parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and further undermined the law this year, decisions that have fueled conservative attempts to suppress the votes of Black people and other racial minorities. Those efforts have accelerated thanks to Republicans’ false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Some of the states that have most aggressively moved to curb voting rights and create new criminal penalties around elections ― Texas, to name one ― are also those that have enacted the most restrictive abortion laws. It is perhaps no coincidence that Mississippi, the state that generated the case that will likely lead to Roe’s overturn, is among the most suppressive of its Black population’s right to participate in the democracy the United States claims to be. The slide backward may not stop with Roe. There are legitimate fears that its reversal will embolden conservatives to seek the invalidation of other decisions that protect fundamental rights, including those in Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects contraception access; Loving v. Virginia, which ruled laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional; and Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. “Fundamental rights are under threat now not because most Americans want to restrict them but because the country’s increasingly anachronistic political system makes it so easy for conservative minorities to win and exert power — even and especially when they don’t have majority support.” In the leaked draft opinion that twists legal logic to invalidate Roe, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right.” But that requires ignoring both Alito’s record as a jurist and the basic implications of his ruling. If the federal government has only the authority to protect rights that are “deeply rooted in the nation’s history in tradition,” as Alito wrote, any number of rights that it didn’t explicitly acknowledge 230 years ago are obviously at risk. Already, some right-wing state lawmakers and candidates are suggesting that they will seek to ban contraception. And this spring, Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said he believed that states should have the final say on the legality of interracial marriage. Braun later walked back his comments, but that hasn’t mollified concerns that conservatives may soon seek to relitigate the seemingly settled question of whether Black and white Americans can marry anywhere in the U.S. Same-sex marriage, a newer freedom, may be even more vulnerable. Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case that guaranteed marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans, is already preparing for the worst: “My job,” he told Axios last month, “is to help people understand just how afraid they should be.” In a healthy democracy, none of these rights would be in peril. Americans support them all: Roughly 60% of the country believes abortion should be legal in most cases, a number that hasn’t changed for 30 years, according to the Pew Research Center. American attitudes on abortion are nuanced, and the public may favor more restrictive laws than most Democrats or reproductive rights groups do. But roughly 70% of the country says it opposes overturning Roe altogether. And it may be the least popular of those rights that may now be in question. They are under threat now not because most Americans want to restrict them but because the country’s increasingly anachronistic political system makes it so easy for conservative minorities to win and exert power ― even and especially when they don’t have majority support. Consider the bizarre and anti-democratic circumstances that led to this moment. Republican presidential candidates have won the popular vote just once in the previous eight elections. But former President Donald Trump, who lost a majority of votes in the 2020 election but won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College, appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who are likely to vote in favor of Roe’s invalidation. One of those seats is occupied by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch because Republican leaders in the Senate ― an anti-democratic institution that grants more political power to rural conservatives than it does to a majority of American voters ― refused to hold confirmation hearings for a Democratic president’s nominee. And when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died months before the 2020 election, that same Republican majority rushed to confirm a conservative replacement, disregarding the very “norm” they had cited just four years prior. At no point during Trump’s presidency did the Senate Republicans who confirmed the three justices represent a majority of the American people. The Senate and the Supreme Court may be the country’s two most democratically distorted institutions. But Congress is also now impossibly gerrymandered in a way that leaves it largely unresponsive to public opinion or the electorate itself. State legislatures, the most heated battlegrounds over abortion rights and democracy, are even more gerrymandered and even less competitive. In states like Wisconsin, which will outlaw abortion if the Supreme Court invalidates Roe, it’s virtually impossible for Democrats to gain state legislative majorities even when they win the popular vote: In 2018, Wisconsin Republicans won 45% of the statewide vote but 65% of the seats in the state Assembly. That has only fueled the GOP’s rush to the far right. Thanks to gerrymandering and the country’s geographic polarization, the vast majority of American elections are now uncompetitive. Primaries are the only place for many voters to exert their will on their representatives, and the easiest path to victory, especially on the right, involves staking out increasingly radical positions on voter fraud, “critical race theory,” or any other right-wing cause that has been used to erode basic democratic rights. Abortion is no different. In recent years, and especially since the Supreme Court allowed a Texas law that effectively banned most abortions in the state to go into effect, Republican state legislatures have entered a death spiral of ever more aggressive restrictions. The 20-week abortion bans that were the Republican cause célèbre not long ago are no longer sufficient: The law that generated the current challenge to Roe was a 15-week abortion ban, and by the time it progressed to the Supreme Court, it was lenient compared to what followed. The Texas law banned abortion at six weeks, and has served as a road map for other states. But even its run as the country’s most extreme abortion law lasted mere months before Oklahoma enacted an even harsher statute. Florida, meanwhile, banned abortion at 15 weeks even in cases of rape or incest, a position that once ended the careers of prominent Republican politicians but is now increasingly popular on the right. The party’s takeover of the judiciary and its secure Supreme Court majority, meanwhile, created the circumstances that made Roe’s overturn a near certainty, even in a case that didn’t originally seek that outcome. And although Democrats hope the ruling will generate severe political backlash, the minoritarian aspects of the country’s political system may insulate many Republicans ― especially in Congress and state legislatures ― from any blowback. “Not only do the rules right now tilt toward Republicans, but Republicans are exploiting those rules,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor and co-author of the book “How Democracies Die.” “Those countermajoritarian institutions that favor a partisan minority are not just protecting and empowering a partisan minority,” he said. “They are protecting and empowering a partisan minority that has gone off the rails, a partisan minority that has become an anti-democratic force. It’s the combination of Republican authoritarianism and countermajoritarianism that makes it so dangerous.” Once democratic declines begin, they are difficult to stop. In Poland, massive protests derailed legislative efforts to curb abortion rights after the right-wing Law and Justice Party swept to power in 2015. But the party got its way through less democratic means: It invalidated the appointments of five justices on Poland’s top constitutional court, replacing them with conservative allies. In 2020, the court overturned laws protecting abortion in cases of fetal abnormality, almost immediately making 98% of procedures performed in the country illegal. The party has continued to strip away basic democratic rights since. Poland is now considered the world’s most rapidly autocratizing country, according to V-Dem, an organization that monitors and assesses democracy globally. Freedom House, another such group, stopped considering Poland a “full democracy” in 2020, and last year rated it as the fastest-declining democracy among 29 countries it studied in Europe and Central Asia. Bolsonaro and his allies have not successfully enacted new laws to further curb abortion rights, but access to legal procedures has nevertheless dwindled since he took office. Just 42 hospitals now perform legal abortions in Brazil, half the number from three years ago, according to researchers. That’s in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the virus also became a guise to suspend legal reproductive health and contraception services, according to Human Rights Watch. Bolsonaro’s government removed two officials from their posts at Brazil’s Ministry of Health after they issued an advisory that sought to improve access to reproductive health during the pandemic. And the climate of fear Bolsonaro has instilled has made nurses and doctors scared that even legal procedures ― like those related to miscarriages ― will lead to prosecution or the loss of medical licenses. Nearly every global organization that evaluates democracies now regards Brazil’s ― the world’s fourth-largest ― as in decline. It ranks in the top 10 of countries where democracy has eroded the most in the last two years, according to V-Dem. Experts warn that it could be in even more peril if Bolsonaro prevails in October’s presidential election, or attempts to undermine the results if he doesn’t. Reduced abortion rights are a symptom of that democratic backsliding, not their cause. But they are an integral part of the decline: Poland’s experience “suggests that disregard for reproductive rights may both reflect and, in turn, intensify weaknesses in democratic culture and contribute to the broader erosion of legitimate institutions,” Atina Krajewska, a law professor at the University of Birmingham in England, wrote in a 2021 article. It’s possible the Supreme Court’s ruling will have the opposite effect. It may be “such an obscene imposition of minority rule that it’s going to make many Americans, and many mainstream American [political] actors, much more aware of the problem,” Levitsky said. “It’s going to take a hack at the legitimacy of a political system that’s already bleeding legitimacy.” But if it doesn’t ― if American democracy continues its steady march toward a more authoritarian future ― the demise of Roe v. Wade will serve as an illuminating signpost on the road there. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Obama Marks DACA’s 10th Anniversary In Conversation With Dreamers,politics," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost NEW YORK ― On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama established the landmark Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provided a lifeline for a portion of the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children. It was also a compromise, implemented after Congress failed to pass the DREAM Act in 2010, which would have guaranteed much broader protections for Dreamers, including a path to citizenship. DACA’s fate has been turbulent, particularly under Obama’s successor, President Donald Trump, who attempted to end DACA in 2017, as part of his administration’s racist and anti-immigrant policies. The program has remained intact after surviving several court challenges, including a 2020 Supreme Court decision determining the Trump administration wrongly ended DACA. On day 1 of his presidency in 2021, President Joe Biden launched an effort to preserve the program. However, last summer, a federal judge ruled DACA was illegal and barred the Biden administration from accepting new applicants, plunging its fate into further limbo. While the program has continued to provide relief and safety for the more than 600,000 current DACA recipients, they’ve had to live through a decade of highs and lows. To mark DACA’s 10th anniversary and reflect on the unfinished political fight, Obama and a panel of five DACA recipients and young leaders held a discussion, released Wednesday by the Obama Foundation and filmed in late May at New World Stages in New York. That setting added an extra layer of significance to the conversation, which HuffPost attended. The group convened on the stage where the new musical “¡Americano!” is running through June 19. It tells the story of Dreamer and political organizer Tony Valdovinos, one of the participants in the discussion. In setting the context for the group’s conversation, the former president underscored the vital role DACA recipients’ personal stories have played in advocating for political change. “None of that would have happened had it not been for a bunch of young people at that time, who, at great risk to themselves, were willing to announce their status,” Obama said. “The courage to tell your stories is what led people to understand just how unfair the status quo was and why we need to change. And so, I think my main message on this 10th anniversary is just to thank you and the hundreds of thousands that you represent, because had it not been for your courage and example that you set, we might not have gotten this done, or got the ball as far down the field as we had.” Many of them brought up how DACA itself gave them the security to tell their stories ― and, in turn, pursue opportunities that could help others. Valdovinos noted how being a DACA recipient allowed him to get his first jobs as a political organizer and then “push harder for what we were originally fighting for, which is the freedom to exist in this country and have opportunities,” he told Obama. Josue de Paz, the CEO and co-founder of First Tech Fund, a technology non-profit, described how DACA meant being able to think “beyond just today and thinking about, you know, ‘Am I going to be safe? Is my mom gonna be safe?’” Prior to DACA, “I didn’t have space to hope for the future. I didn’t have space to hope for: ‘What can I do for the community?’” he said. Similarly, Sumbul Siddiqui, a medical student at Loyola University Chicago, said DACA has given her the peace of mind to “think about your studies, and we’ll take care of the rest.” She recounted the loneliness she felt prior to DACA in 2011, when she graduated from high school. “I was just learning about my immigration status, and I didn’t know that there was anyone else out there like me. So it was a very, very depressing time,” she said, describing how she had to enroll in college as an international student, despite not being one. “Now that I’m looking back, I’m a different person because of DACA. I am where I am now because of DACA and all the people who’ve been advocating for us. I’m not alone. I was in 2011, but now I’m open.” Siddiqui also referenced the “roller coaster” of watching DACA’s political and legal fate hang in the balance over the last few years. It’s an uncertainty with which Devashish Basnet is also intimately familiar, explaining he was in high school during the 2016 election and early years of the Trump presidency. “It’s a really strange feeling that anyone that’s not a DACA recipient could have some difficulty understanding. The news notifications tell you that the future of DACA is at stake, and the future of your status in this country is at stake,” said Basnet, who just graduated from Hunter College and was named a Rhodes Scholar, with plans to pursue a masters’ degree in refugee and forced migration studies at Oxford. “Juggling college applications and checking your phone to see if your status is going to be the same is a harrowing kind of experience. When I think about the mobilizing and what that did for me, I think DACA gave me the opportunity to advocate for myself, because as much as mobilizing and organizing is critical, it’s about changing hearts and minds.” At the same time, Basnet noted being an advocate is a delicate balance. DACA recipients have had to be public advocates while also personally advocating for their own family’s basic survival. “It’s a really interesting experience to grow up being an advocate, whether for yourself or for your parents,” Basnet said. “We all serve as second translators, and I think all of us understood immigration policy more than young students should have.” Jessica Astudillo’s early experiences of having to be a translator for her parents helped shape her path toward becoming a doctor and taught her how to be resourceful. “Part of the reason why I got into healthcare was because I was that person at seven, eight years of age trying to translate medical terminology for my parents,” said Astudillo, a resident physician in pediatrics at NYU Langone. “Even now, you know, I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to help a couple of my family members obtain citizenship. Obviously, I’m not a lawyer, but I know how to find the answers. I think that’s something important that even now, as a physician, I might not know everything. I absolutely don’t know everything. But I can figure it out, and I know where to look.” In framing the discussion, Obama also referenced the challenge of balancing the benefits and burdens of advocacy. “I wish I could say that you don’t have to be courageous anymore, and you can just focus on a different kind of courage: All the good work you guys are doing in the community. But this is something that we’re still gonna have to keep on advocating for,” he told the group, noting that the fight is unfinished. In response, Valdovinos had a question for the former president. “What do we do next? We lost a lot of steam, watching Congress vote down the DREAM Act, and obviously, you left office, and other folks took office, and here we are now,” he said. “Ultimately, I think a lot of Dreamers really lost the unity of working with each other for a solution. So I guess my question is: How do you advise us to continue organizing?” “I spend most of my time now working with young people like yourselves because it’s my view that on a whole spectrum of issues, it’s your voices that are going to come up with a solution. My generation, I think, moved forward on some fronts, but have stalled, as you said, on others,” Obama told Valdovinos. “One thing I’ve learned with young people, they can sniff out if somebody’s BSing them.” Obama went on to cite the power of “storytelling, whether it’s through plays or movies or articles or books or TikTok — I mean, whatever it is, right?” he said. “It puts a human face on the issue in a way that it’s harder to not do the right thing.” But he also acknowledged how much the country has changed politically in the last decade, and the uphill battle Dreamers continue to face. “We’re at a moment in time where the political gears are stuck,” he said. “And it’s gonna take some work for us to unstick ’em.” Later, Valdovinos said Obama’s answer to his question, as well as the discussion itself, was sobering. It was also a full-circle moment for him personally, and a realization that his outlook has changed too, as he recalled in a phone interview from his office in Phoenix, where he is the founder of La Machine, a political consulting firm. Early in his career, Valdovinos met Obama briefly at a rally in 2012. “We asked him for help on how to organize. And he told us to organize, organize, organize, and that really, just for me, tremendously made a difference. And then, to be an adult and not be a 22-year-old, to be 31 and sitting there in front of him, was very different,” he said. “It was tough to hear his story on immigration, and it was tough to realize that we’re in a tougher moment. And I think all the hopefulness and eagerness of organizing in your 20s wears up when you become an adult. And the world feels very differently, looks very differently and the road looks longer.” “I’m actually looking at one of his stickers I still have to this day,” he continued, referring to Obama’s famous “HOPE” campaign poster, designed by Shepard Fairey. Today, Valdovinos said, that youthful sense of hope has now turned into a hardened “resilience.” “When I first joined organizing, I legitimately believed as a young adult that we were going to see this country move forward, that the DREAM Act was going to be passed, that we were going to be able to earn citizenship through military service or academic achievements. And then, none of that happened,” he said. “You talk to me today, the objectives are different, the future is different. And I don’t think it has anything really to do with feeling hopeful. I think it has everything to do with resilience, and ultimately sharing our stories, our stories of contribution in this country and fighting back the narratives from our former president that put a very negative light on our communities. And I think that’s what I do. I try and share our culture, our story, our commitment.” As portrayed in “¡Americano!,” Valdovinos’ childhood dream was joining the Marines. When he turned 18 and went to enlist, he found out he was an undocumented immigrant, forcing him to redirect his dream into a different path. Finding a mentor in Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a Marine veteran whom he helped elect to Congress, Valdovinos realized he could serve his country on the political battlefield instead. As founder of La Machine, he has run various campaigns in Arizona. For example, La Machine recently helped elect Yassamin Ansari, the first Iranian American to be an elected official in Arizona’s history, and the youngest woman ever elected to Phoenix’s city council. “I’ve really enjoyed creating new opportunities and showing communities that we can be represented, that we can have a voice,” he said. For years, Valdovinos has told his story as an organizer and advocate, and helped others craft their stories for voters. In an unexpected turn of events, his organizing career is also what led to a new chapter of telling his story: A musical based on his life. One of the musical’s co-writers, Jonathan Rosenberg, heard Valdovinos on NPR, talking about his work organizing Latino voters during the 2016 election. Compelled by his story, Rosenberg reached out to Valdovinos and then brought the idea to Michael Barnard, the artistic director of the Phoenix Theatre Company. Over the next several years, a team of collaborators developed “¡Americano!,” which premiered in Phoenix in early 2020, before its current run in New York. Valdovinos, who consulted on the production, describes it as a tale of “realities and circumstances and choices,” as well as a love story about the Marines, public service and what it means to be an American. The team behind the musical hopes it will head to Broadway next, particularly as one of the few major productions with a predominantly Latinx cast. Valdovinos said he’s particularly proud the musical reflects “just the honest human experience, and it’s not a Disney story.” Like the discussion between Obama and the DACA recipients, the musical is also sobering at times. Toward the end, actor Sean Ewing, who plays Valdovinos, reminds the audience of the jeopardy that undocumented immigrants in the U.S. continue to face every day. While Valdovinos is excited about the musical’s success and hopes it will continue to reach new audiences, he noted that “ultimately, it’s based off of a reality politically, which is that there’s a significant amount of human beings in this country that are stuck, that are in danger, or hiding, or whatever — it’s so many different stories.” “One of my only hopes is to humanize, honestly, our contribution in this country, because it has been very brutal to be seen as a negative addition in this country,” he said. “For me, being an American is doing what you can for this country, and being the best you can for your community. And that’s been my life’s pursuit.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Trump-Backed Election Denier Wins GOP Secretary Of State Primary In Nevada,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Former Nevada state Rep. Jim Marchant, a Republican who has spread the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and said he would not have certified the results, won the GOP secretary of state primary Tuesday night, putting an election denier one step away from overseeing elections in the key swing state. The Associated Press declared Marchant the winner early Wednesday morning. He won 38% of the vote in the crowded field that featured seven candidates. Kristoph Dahir, a Republican who countered Marchant’s fraud claims and defended Nevada’s 2020 election, finished with just 6.4% of the vote. Marchant will face attorney and former Nevada state athletic commissioner Francisco Aguilar in November. Aguilar ran uncontested in the Democratic primary. Marchant’s full embrace of the “big lie” about the 2020 election won him President Donald Trump’s endorsement, which made him the apparent favorite in a crowded race to replace outgoing Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske (R), who is term-limited. Cegavske defended Nevada’s elections in the wake of the 2020 vote and certified the results of President Joe Biden’s victory in the state despite Trump’s claims that widespread fraud had marred the results there and in other closely contested states. Marchant’s victory will intensify the threats facing the country’s election system ― and its democracy as a whole ― as GOP election deniers like him seek to win secretary of state positions in key swing states across the country. Those offices could grant conspiracy theorists and opponents of legitimate elections, like Marchant, broad powers over future contests, allowing them to exert control over voting rolls and how elections are managed, executed and even ultimately certified. The prevalence of such candidates has generated fears among democracy experts and Democrats that Republicans are plotting to undermine the legitimacy of the 2024 election and other future contests. Marchant, who helped organize an “America first” slate of candidates seeking secretary of state and other election administration positions, has effectively acknowledged that the point of those candidacies is to take over the election system ahead of the 2024 contest. “I can’t stress enough how important the secretary of state offices are. I think they are the most important elections in our country in 2022. And why is that? We control the election system,” Marchant said at a conference in October, Vice News reported. “In 2022, we’re going to take back our country.” Marchant has been among the most ardent and conspiratorial of those candidates. After losing a congressional race to incumbent Rep. Steve Horsford (D) by nearly 5 percentage points in 2020, Marchant baselessly alleged that fraud had marred the results and filed a legal challenge seeking a new election. A judge dismissed the suit after a brief hearing. During his secretary of state campaign, he has repeatedly asserted that the 2020 presidential vote was marred by fraud and stolen from Trump. But he hasn’t stopped there: In a February interview with The Washington Post, Marchant implied that a “cabal” had stolen every Nevada election since 2006. “Once I get in there, I can start to whittle away at the ways that they cheat, to the point where the people that get elected here in Nevada are who the people of Nevada really want,” he said. “We haven’t elected anybody here since 2006. They have been installed and selected by the cabal.” Marchant has worked closely with other conspiracy theorists to link election-denying candidates across the country, speaking at numerous conferences alongside adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory and other outlandish claims about the country’s electoral system. Last year, he appeared at a conference put on by Phil Waldron, according to The New York Times. Waldron is a retired Army colonel who claimed that voting machines were hacked in order to swing the results of the 2020 election, and he circulated a memo arguing that Trump should declare a national emergency to contest the certification of the results. The “America first” slate Marchant helped organize has held weekly conference calls ahead of a crucial summer of primaries, The New York Times reported this month. They share campaign and messaging strategies, and have proposed a suite of potential policies that they would seek to implement to purge voting rolls, eliminate mail-in ballots and implement other restrictions on voting, the Times reported. Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), an election denier who twice voted against certifying the 2020 presidential contest in Congress, lost his secretary of state primary in Georgia last month. But other Republicans have won party endorsements and appear to be favored in battleground primaries in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota, all of which will occur later this year. In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who contested the results of the 2020 election and was outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, would have the power to appoint a secretary of state should he win election in November. Marchant’s victory in Nevada may buoy the hopes of similar candidates in looming secretary of state primaries. Even if it doesn’t, it will put him one victory away from assuming control of elections in a crucial battleground state heading into a general election in which the political atmosphere will likely favor the GOP. A single secretary of state like him could be powerful enough to throw future elections into chaos and push the country toward a democratic crisis.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

10,Prominent Election Denier Adam Laxalt Wins Nevada GOP Senate Primary,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Politics Reporter, HuffPost Adam Laxalt, a Donald Trump-endorsed “Big Lie” purveyor, cruised to victory in the Nevada GOP Senate primary on Tuesday. Laxalt, who easily beat Army veteran Sam Brown for the Republican nomination, is hoping to unseat incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this cycle. A GOP pickup in Nevada would severely endanger Democratic control of the Senate next year. Since the 2020 election, Laxalt has emerged as a champion of Trump’s election fraud lies, especially among Republican senate hopefuls. A former Nevada attorney general who served as Trump’s campaign co-chair, Laxalt filed several lawsuits on behalf of Trump allies seeking to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory. Laxalt has suggested he may challenge the results of his own race if he loses in November. “With me at the top of the ticket, we’re going to be able to get everybody at the table and come up with a full plan, do our best to try to secure this election, get as many observers as we can, and file lawsuits early, if there are lawsuits we can file to try to tighten up the election,” Laxalt told a local radio host in August. In a November 2020 op-ed in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Laxalt argued, without evidence, that Nevada election officials tabulated “thousands of illegal votes consisting of a combination of dead voters, out-of-state voters, double voters (those who cast ballots in Nevada and another state), among other improper votes.” Laxalt has flip-flopped in his sweeping criticisms of Nevada’s mail-in voting system, telling crowds in urban Democratic counties that voting by mail isn’t secure, while urging supporters in rural counties where Republicans run up margins to get their neighbors to vote absentee. Laxalt, the son of former New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici and the grandson of Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, last ran for office in 2018, when he lost the governor’s race to Democrat Steve Sisolak. This time around, his election-denying rhetoric hasn’t cost him the support of the establishment wing of the party. Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, see him as their best chance to oust Cortez Masto. Nevada is still a purple state where elections are often decided by close margin. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by less than three points. Cortez Masto won by roughly the same margin four years earlier. Democrats are facing a challenging political environment this year, with voters heavily focused on the skyrocketing cost of living. Cortez Masto, who was elected in 2016 and was the first Latina senator, has sought to address these concerns by pushing for legislation to offset high gas and health care prices. But the troubling economic picture and Biden’s poor approval ratings could hobble Cortez Masto’s chances. Republicans are already seeing positive signs in the race, such as increased enthusiasm among GOP voters and an uptick in Democratic voters switching their registration to the party. The coming Supreme Court decision rolling back Roe v. Wade could also impact the Senate race in Nevada, where abortion rights have been codified into law. Laxalt has said he would leave the issue to individual states even though he has a history of advocating against abortion access.

11,GOP Rep. Nancy Mace Defeats Trump-Backed Challenger,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) defeated a primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, handing Trump another setback on his quest to punish Republicans who break with him. Mace, a staunch fiscal conservative, prevailed over Katie Arrington, a former state lawmaker. Arrington, who served in Trump’s Department of Defense, slammed Mace for voting to certify the 2020 election results and criticizing Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. With the benefit of a major fundraising advantage and high-profile endorsements of her own though, Mace successfully argued that she was both a “constitutional conservative,” and better equipped to preserve GOP control over the politically diverse district. “This speaks to her ability to fundraise, her ability to get her message out to voters,” said Gibbs Knotts, a political scientist at the College of Charleston. “And it is evidence that Republicans were interested in keeping this seat in Republican hands.” Mace is now due to take on Democratic nominee Annie Andrews, a pediatrician, in the general election. Mace is favored to hold the seat, which was redrawn this year to have a more conservative electorate. Mace’s win in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District comes on the heels of primary outcomes in Georgia that were similarly disappointing for Trump. But there are limits to the implications of GOP voters’ preferences in the coastal, Lowcountry region where Republicans tend to have an independent streak. In South Carolina’s adjacent 7th Congressional District, by contrast, the more conservative Republican electorate ousted Rep. Tom Rice (R), another Trump critic, on Tuesday. “Certainly in the first congressional district, the majority of the base has moved beyond Trump and is concerned about electability,” Knotts said. Although the makeup of South Carolina’s 1st was more liberal in 2020, Arrington’s electoral history gave Mace ammunition to argue that Arrington was a risky bet for Republicans. In 2018, Arrington ousted then-Rep. Mark Sanford (R) in a primary, largely because of Sanford’s outspoken criticism of Trump. She went on to lose the seat to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election. Mace unseated Cunningham in the following election cycle. In addition, Mace, who worked on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, struck a careful balance in her criticism of Trump. Unlike Rice, who lost his primary on Tuesday, Mace did not vote to impeach Trump for his role in fomenting the U.S. Capitol riot. She did, however, vote to hold former Trump adviser Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to testify before Congress about his role in the violent event. Mace benefited from the support of two senior Trump administration officials: Nikki Haley, former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor; and Mick Mulvaney, former Trump chief of staff and South Carolina congressman. A leaked text-message exchange between Arrington and Mulvaney in March, after Mulvaney endorsed Mace, contributed to a sense that Arrington was a flawed candidate. In response to Arrington calling him a “piece of shit” and questioning whether Mulvaney’s Catholicism had made him a poor choice for Trump administration envoy to Northern Ireland, Mulvaney wrote, “You need to realize that you might be unstable.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,"After Defying Trump, GOP Rep. Tom Rice Loses Reelection In South Carolina",politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), one of just 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, lost his bid for reelection Tuesday. Rice lost the GOP nomination to state Rep. Russell Fry in a campaign seemingly dominated by the shadow of Trump, who held a March 12 rally for Fry in Florence, South Carolina. A poll in May by the Trafalgar Group had put Rice well behind, at 25% to Fry’s 42%. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The primary field was crowded, but the attention mainly centered on Rice and Fry, who played up his endorsement from the former president. “It’s like I said earlier, on June 14 it’s our turn to vote and on June 14 here in the 7th Congressional District, we’re going to vote to impeach Tom Rice at the ballot box,” Fry said at the March rally while standing next to Trump. Trump took particular pleasure in campaigning against Republican House members who had voted for his impeachment, pointing out Rice by name in an interview with The Washington Post “You had people drop out of races that they had no intention of dropping out of, and the other ones are losing, like Rice in South Carolina,” Trump said. Though Rice voted to impeach Trump, he also voted to support a challenge to certifying some Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021, a vote he later said he regretted. “In the wee hours of that disgraceful night, while waiting for the Capitol of our great country to be secured, I knew I should vote to certify,” Rice said in December. “But because I had made a public announcement of my intent to object, I did not want to go back on my word. So, yeah, I regret my vote to object.” After the Trump rally in March, Rice called the former president a “would-be tyrant” and said he only wanted “a ‘yes man’ candidate” in Fry. Still, Rice recently signaled he was open to a rapprochement with Trump, telling ABC News earlier this month that he could still consider voting for Trump in the future if Trump apologized for his actions on Jan. 6. “If he came out and said, ‘I’m sorry that I made a huge mistake on Jan. 6,’ then I might consider it,” Rice said. Rice’s loss will open up a slot on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the House’s tax-writing panel. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,This Is How Reactionary Prosecutors Thwart Criminal Justice Reform,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost UPDATE: June 15, 2022 ― At the hearing Wednesday, Judge Julie McKay denied Thomas Butler’s request to remove prosecutor Larry Haskell’s office from the case. She resentenced Butler to 30 years — 336 months for the weapons enhancements and 24 months for the base sentence — far below the 62 to 72 years prosecutors had requested. Earlier: Thomas Butler thought he might finally get the chance to go home. In 2010, when Butler was 26, he was sentenced to life without parole in prison under Washington’s persistent offender statute, better known as “three strikes.” Passed by voters during the height of the “tough-on-crime” hysteria of the 1990s, the three strikes law requires mandatory life sentences for people repeatedly convicted of certain crimes, including robbery, assault and homicide. Amid the 2020 nationwide protests over racism in policing and incarceration, Washington’s three strikes law was an obvious target for reform. It has resulted in life without parole sentences for many people, including Butler, whose crimes did not result in death or long-term physical injury for the victims. Although Black people represent just 4% of the state’s population, they account for 38% of people sentenced under three strikes. In recent years, the state legislature removed robbery in the second degree, the act of taking someone’s property without causing bodily injury, from the list of crimes included in the three strikes law. Because one of Butler’s strikes was a second-degree robbery conviction, he became eligible for resentencing last year. By then, Butler had spent about 17 cumulative years behind bars. He had quit drugs, joined the Black Prisoners’ Caucus, signed up for the educational classes available to him, and started allowing himself to hope for a future outside of prison. When he found out he was eligible for a new sentence, he thought he had a good chance of going home soon. “I’m not a bad person anymore,” he said in a phone interview. “There’s no reason to keep me locked up.” But when the Spokane County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office filed its sentencing brief last year, it asked for Butler to be resentenced to 62 to 72 years — a de facto life sentence. Butler, who is Black, was convicted in Spokane County, which is 2% Black. His case falls under the jurisdiction of Spokane County Prosecuting Attorney Larry Haskell, who is married to a woman who has publicly described herself as a “proud white nationalist.” Last month, Butler’s lawyer asked Superior Court Judge Julie McKay to remove Haskell’s office from the case, citing concerns that Butler would be treated more harshly because of his race. McKay is expected to announce her decision at a Wednesday hearing. Haskell, who is up for reelection this year, declined to comment for this story. But his handling of Butler’s case shows how prosecutors can use their broad discretionary power to effectively gut well-intentioned criminal justice reforms. Haskell’s office arrived at Butler’s new, near-life sentence by choosing to stack six firearm enhancements, each of which carries several years in prison, on top of a base sentence of 32 to 42 years. If Haskell gets his way, Butler, an intended beneficiary of the three strikes reform bill, will likely still die in prison. “What’s the point of making me go through all this? Take my life sentence and give me another life sentence?” In 2000, just after his 17th birthday, Butler was convicted of second-degree robbery and spent several months in jail. His second strike was in 2002, when he robbed a bank and was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison. During that time, “I kind of just sat around the prison, hanging out, becoming a worse person,” Butler said. Shortly after he got out of prison, Butler attempted to rob a home that he believed had drugs inside, only to get shot in the arm and the spine by one of the people he tried to rob. As a result of the shooting, Butler had to have surgery on his back and have his kidney removed, and continues to experience partial paralysis in his left leg. When Butler woke up in the hospital after the attempted robbery, he was facing his third strike. Haskell, who also worked on Butler’s case at trial as a deputy prosecuting attorney, offered him a lesser sentence if he agreed to plead guilty, but Butler went to trial and was convicted. In addition to the life without parole sentence mandated by the three strikes law, he received several gun-related sentencing enhancements. “After I lost the trial, I was pretty hopeless. I went back to prison just angry, scared and hopeless,” Butler said. With nothing to look forward to or work toward, Butler wound up getting in fights and seeking out drugs, he said. After eight years, something changed. “I found God. I found hope. I found purpose. I found value,” Butler said. “It changed my perspective. It was a paradigm shift,” he said. “Now I’m just trying to make myself a better person and make the people around me better. Hopefully, one day they’ll open up these doors,” Butler said. “And even if not, at the end of the day, it’s better than just living a hopeless life.” In 1993, Washington became the first state in the country to adopt a three strikes law after voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative. In the following years, as politicians won elections through racist fearmongering about so-called “super-predator” youth, Washington state lawmakers expanded the definition of a “persistent offender” and mandated life without parole sentences after two strikes in certain cases. Around this time, Washington voters approved “sentencing enhancements” — additional years tacked on to a prison sentence — for people who commit felonies while armed with a weapon. Because enhancements are served consecutively, some individuals end up doing more time in prison for enhancements than for the underlying crime. Nearly one-third of people in Washington state prisons who have multiple weapons enhancements are Black, according to Seattle-based news outlet PubliCola. There is no evidence that three strikes laws or weapons enhancements deter crime or improve public safety. Still, these laws have remained largely intact. In 2019, state lawmakers dropped second-degree robbery as a strike, a modest reform effort that left in place extreme mandatory sentences for other crimes. It took another two years for lawmakers to make that change retroactive, making about 114 people eligible for resentencing. After the three strikes reform bill became retroactive, Butler was transferred from state prison to the Spokane County jail to await resentencing. His lawyer, Stephen Graham, asked for a new base sentence of 20 years, plus 5 years for the weapons enhancements, arguing that the prosecutors’ request for a de facto life sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment for crimes in which no victim was killed or seriously injured. While Butler was awaiting resentencing, the Inlander published a detailed investigation into Haskell’s wife’s racist online presence. The Inlander found Lesley Anne Haskell’s accounts on Facebook and Gab — a social media site popular among white nationalists — where she posted and reposted hateful screeds against Black people and transgender people, and made false claims about white people being under attack. She described Black Lives Matter activists as “the true terrorists in America,” suggested that all transgender people are “mentally ill,” called MSNBC’s Joy Reid the “true definition of the word ‘n****r’” and described herself as a “proud, white nationalist (NOT supremacist).” She frequently interacted with white nationalist figurehead Nick Fuentes and claimed, “Our race is dying, we need to make more White babies.” She described her husband, “the Spo Co Prosecutor” as “the last line of conservative armor that the County has.” Asked to comment on his wife’s posts, Haskell told the Inlander that his wife “is a strong-willed person who will speak her mind” and claimed that her thoughts and beliefs had no influence on his actions as a prosecutor. “Succinctly stated by the United States Supreme Court, ‘guilt by association’ is “one of the most odious institutions in history,’” Haskell continued. In May, Graham, Butler’s lawyer, asked the court to disqualify Haskell’s office from working on Butler’s case, citing his wife’s comments. Graham also noted that Haskell had disproportionately sought stacked weapons enhancements against Black people between 2008 and 2009, around the time of Butler’s three strikes trial. “The events have undercut the public’s faith in our court system,” Graham wrote in a court filing. “Mr. Butler and his family deserve the assurance that Mr. Butler is being judged by his actions alone, without being treated a certain way due to the color of his skin.” McKay is expected to decide on Wednesday whether to dismiss Haskell’s office from the case. If she allows him to remain on the case, she may also make a decision about Butler’s new sentence. Butler awaits his fate from county jail, where he spends between 22 and 24 hours a day locked in his cell. “What’s the point of making me go through all this? Take my life sentence and give me another life sentence?” Butler said. “I could’ve just stayed where I was and you guys could have filed the paperwork and changed the language on my judgment and sentencing.” “Instead, you bring me all the way across the state, put me in the county jail, totally uproot my current circumstances and then tell me, ‘Well, that little bit of hope that you had, screw that, we’re gonna give you 62 years and you’re still gonna die in prison.’” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Marjorie Taylor Greene Argues Global Warming Is 'Actually Healthy For Us',politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) apparently believes in global warming ― but she’s not concerned, because in her opinion, it’s “actually healthy for us.” “The temperature tracking is from the 1800s. We’ve already warmed 1 degree Celsius and do you know what’s happened since then?” the extremist Republican said during an appearance on the Right Side Broadcasting Network on Monday. “We have had more food grown since then, which feeds people. We are able to producing fossil fuels, keeps people’s houses warm in the winter. That saves people’s lives, people die in the cold,” she said. “This earth warming, and carbon, is actually healthy for us. It helps feed people, it helps keep people alive.” The comments came after RSBN host Brian Glenn complained that proponents of the Green New Deal want to “put all types of regulations on your vehicles and factories and things like that.” Greene advised him sarcastically that it’s because people think “carbon is bad.” She then attempted to refute that argument by explaining that plants need carbon to survive. Marge Greene presents her scientific argument why global warming is a good thing: “This earth warming and carbon is actually healthy for us.” pic.twitter.com/fw5DMMeSJN Greene, who is not a scientist and holds a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, was right in saying the earth’s surface temperature has risen by roughly 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial era. It’s widely accepted science that global warming been brought on by rising carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, which trap the sun’s heat when they rise into the atmosphere. Emissions have been driven by human industrialization. The rise in temperature is driving an increase in extreme weather events, shifting temperature extremes, intensifying heavy rainfall, droughts and other damaging climate extremes that are negatively impacting crop production and threatening global food security. Things like using energy to heat or cool your home, or for agricultural processes, generate carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, not the other way around. And yes, as any school-age biology student could tell you, plants do use carbon dioxide. This underscores the urgency to protect and restore ecosystems like forests and grasslands to help remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Greene has previously argued that the climate “just changes” of its own accord. “How much taxes and how much money did the people back in the ice age spend to warm up the earth?” she asked at a town hall in March 2018. “Maybe perhaps we live on a ball that rotates around the sun, that flies through the universe, and maybe our climate just changes. And I don’t think a whole lot of spending is going to do anything about it.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Biden's Trip To Saudi Arabia Far More Likely To Benefit Saudis Than U.S.,politics," Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden will travel to Saudi Arabia next month, the White House said on Tuesday, making him America’s latest leader to affirm the historic quid pro quo with the kingdom. But, although Biden’s plan has clear benefits for the Saudis, there’s little chance the high-profile visit will deliver much for the struggling president or for the U.S. The Saudis have limited influence over most Americans’ top concern: inflation. Despite the conventional wisdom that the oil-rich nation can lower the cost of gas by increasing supply, energy experts say Saudi Arabia cannot quickly reduce the price at the pump. Though U.S. officials hope to bolster ties between the kingdom and fellow American partner Israel, progress toward Saudi-Israel cooperation is likely to be limited. And a visit is unlikely to quash the Saudis’ interest in friendlier relations with Russia and China, a source of alarm in Washington. “I see [Biden’s trip] as highly risky with an uncertain payoff,” said Dalia Dassa Kaye, an adjunct political scientist at the Rand Corp. think tank. The planning and announcement of the visit are already a triumph for Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Biden has now publicly reneged on his promise to “make them pay the price” for misconduct such as the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence blamed on the prince. Instead, Biden has offered a gentler touch ― securing little progress on accountability for Khashoggi’s killers or human rights broadly while giving the Saudis what they most wanted. Biden allies expressed alarm on Tuesday over Biden’s decision to visit Saudi Arabia. The crown prince’s “blood stain has not been cleansed,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told CNN. “I get it that circumstances change. But what’s the fundamental issue in the world right now? It’s the authoritarians.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told CNN he has “real worries about patching up relationships with the crown prince absent some real commitments for justice... in Saudi Arabia.” The visit is the latest in a string of disappointments for key lawmakers and activists who say Biden has relinquished any leverage he once had over the Saudis. At the start of his presidency, Biden challenged the assumption that Saudi Arabia had largely unconditional support from Washington. But instead of demanding Saudi leaders respond to U.S. concerns in exchange for restoring the strategic relationship between the two countries, Biden began a pattern of making concessions to Saudi priorities. Earlier this month, six Democratic chairs of key House committees urged Biden in a letter to “recalibrate” U.S.-Saudi relations by pressing the kingdom to end oil market deals with Russia, ease its crackdown on dissidents, pull back from China and prioritize peace in Yemen, where the Saudis have waged a brutal military campaign since 2015. But it may be difficult for Biden to advance any of those priorities when the Saudis feel they can define the terms of engagement. Biden is headed to the kingdom to attend a meeting of regional leaders and will discuss the Yemen war and human rights, among other issues, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, emphasizing the president was invited by Saudi King Salman. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington offered a different picture, saying the president is visiting to “enhance” U.S.-Saudi ties and that he will meet with the crown prince, known as MBS, while presenting the regional summit as an afterthought. “There’s no way to get around the fact that if it is in Riyadh, it is on his terms ― it is what MBS wants,” Kaye said. As Biden faces domestic criticism over domestic gas prices, courting the world’s largest crude oil exporter could boost the impression that he is trying to address Americans’ frustration. Yet even in the best-case scenario for the president ― if the Saudis agree to expand production even beyond their latest pledge to do so, earlier this month ― he has little hope of denting global oil prices, industry analysts say. Traders, whose views ultimately shape prices, have been anticipating increases in production from the Saudis and their allies in the global oil cartel OPEC+. Meanwhile, supply is expected to plummet later in the year as the full effect of Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia sets in, potentially removing up to 3 million barrels of Russian oil per day from the market. “There is no way that Saudi Arabia has the ability to produce as much oil as the world has lost because of the Russian embargo, and no country has that ability,” Robert Weiner of George Washington University recently told The Hill. Biden has downplayed the perception that his trip is related to gas prices, telling reporters on June 12 that “the commitments from the Saudis don’t relate to anything having to do with energy .... It has to do with much larger issues than having to do with the energy piece.” If success on oil is off the table for Biden, his team could struggle to present Americans with a clear win from the trip. The various proposals that U.S. officials are working on, like a Saudi-Egypt-Israel deal on the little-known Red Sea islands, are unlikely to draw the same level of attention. For Saudi Arabia, however, a broader agenda is ideal. Its leaders view the trip as a way to move past squabbling and ensure U.S.-Saudi collaboration on many fronts for decades to come. “The Saudis want to discuss a strategic framework for cooperation ... looking at things holistically. Biden might have preferred more of a pick-and-choose menu option but I think that’s off the table: if Biden wants to do energy, he has to do politics, and that has become clear to the administration,” said Ayhem Kamel, the head of the Middle East and North Africa research team at the Eurasia Group consultancy. In 2019, as skeptics of the Saudis gained ground in Congress and Biden and other opponents of then-President Donald Trump highlighted his ties to the kingdom, “the U.S. had more leverage,” Kamel said. “The 2022 perspective is one where the Saudis have more leverage,” he added. In a recent Foreign Affairs article that was widely shared in policy circles, Kaye called Biden’s then-rumored trip a “transparent compromise on principles” and argued the president must prove a visit would deliver “anything of lasting value to U.S. interests.” She told HuffPost she has little faith that will happen. “The shift is more about, ‘We’re going to show we’re the grown-ups and when interests are at stake, we’re willing to adjust,’” Kaye said. “It’s a very dominant way of thinking among many in Washington. My own view is partnerships go both ways.” She worries that the Saudis will see Biden’s decision to visit the country as another signal that they need not worry about U.S. pushback if they pursue risky policies. Saudi Arabia could ratchet up tensions with its regional rival Iran, for instance, by pulling away from talks with the Iranians or torpedoing negotiations with a pro-Iran militia in Yemen, where a recently extended truce remains precarious. Alternately, Biden’s embrace of the Saudis could spur the Iranians or their partners to hit U.S. or allied targets. “This is a volatile environment,” Kaye said, citing fading hopes of restoring the Iranian nuclear deal. “If there’s more military escalation, that further disrupts global oil supplies, worsening inflation.” Another concern is that the crown prince and his team could take the visit as an indication that Biden no longer cares about the Khashoggi case or the Saudis’ ongoing assault on perceived enemies, from women’s rights activists to the children of a former Saudi intelligence chief. “Efforts to repair the U.S. relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia without a genuine commitment to prioritize human rights are not only a betrayal of your campaign promises, but will likely embolden the crown prince to commit further violations of international human rights and humanitarian law,” 13 rights groups wrote in a June 9 statement asking Biden to set preconditions for a meeting with bin Salman. Fundamentally, Biden’s team and its critics disagree over how U.S.-Saudi policy must change ― whether the goal is to restore a friendly tone or to address long-standing concerns over both the kingdom’s choices and how the U.S. has handled Riyadh. Administration officials view the cease-fire in Yemen as a key success, for example, but they have said little about evidence that the U.S. failed to examine the role of American weapons in killing civilians in the war there or revelations about ongoing American assistance that would shape any renewed fighting. Biden largely avoided Middle East issues in his first year in office and tasked his top national security lieutenants to focus elsewhere while lower-level staff took the lead. That strategy is no longer viable. “The idea that Saudi and the Gulf countries are ... on the margins or no longer important from a U.S. perspective, I think that has become more difficult given developments and the Russia-Ukraine war,” Kamel said. For now, Biden has made a clear choice about how he will respond to that shift: by leaning on tradition, whether it pays off or not.

16,Twitter Users Hilariously Offer New Things Herschel Walker Can Lie About,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker is facing criticism after it turned out that his claims that he worked in law enforcement with the Cobb County Police Department and as an FBI agent turned out to be false. Yep. Turns out that there is no evidence he ever worked for the police department or the FBI, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The glaring falsehoods from the Senate hopeful inspired many Twitter users to turn Walker into this decade’s version of the joke about actor Chuck Norris. Herschel Walker: “I invented the wheel, discovered penicillin, cracked the DNA code, was a highly decorated FBI agent, graduated summa cum laude from Harvard, and am the largest peach farmer in Georgia.” According to Herschel Walker, he was:  an FBI agent, a police officer, a college graduate, valedictorian of his class....But that's not all, his biggest honor was being crowned Miss America. pic.twitter.com/ieQ4zQGRIG Remember when that asteroid was plunging into the Earth's atmosphere and Herschel Walker and a scrappy team of outsiders took the Space Shuttle up to destroy it? A lot of people don’t know this but Herschel Walker actually built the Grand Canyon Herschel Walker wrote Hamilton.

1,Kyrsten Sinema Was Main Force Behind Closing The ‘Boyfriend Loophole’ In Gun Deal,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) is leading the push for the inclusion of closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” potentially one of the most significant provisions in the gun deal being worked out by the Senate. “I can confirm she proposed the domestic violence provision be included in the framework,” a Sinema spokesperson told HuffPost. Another source close to the negotiations also confirmed Sinema’s role. Closing the loophole would prevent convicted stalkers and abusers from buying or owning guns. Current federal law bars firearm purchases by people convicted of domestic abuse against their spouse or someone with whom they’ve lived or had a child, but it does not cover dating partners or other individuals. Nearly half of all women killed in America are murdered by a current or former intimate partner, and research shows that access to a gun makes it five times more likely an abusive partner will kill his female victim. Every month in the United States, 70 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner, according to Everytown For Gun Safety. Women in the United States are 21 times more likely to be killed with a gun than women in other wealthy nations. And there is a strong link between domestic violence and mass shootings. Research from The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence found about two-thirds of mass shooters between 2014 and 2019 either killed a partner or family member or had a history of domestic violence. The perpetrators of the massacres of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, and of 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017, both had histories of domestic violence. A bipartisan group of 20 lawmakers is working to finalize what is likely to be the first major piece of federal gun control legislation in three decades. Sinema and Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) are the lead negotiators of the proposal, which came about after the recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. Senators are still writing the legislation, but an announcement on Sunday indicated the proposal would, in addition to closing the “boyfriend loophole,” include incentives for states to pass “red flag” laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others, enhance background checks for buyers younger than 21, invest in mental health and school safety programs, and increase penalties for “straw purchasers” who buy guns for others. Democrats have long worked to close the loophole, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) first introducing legislation to do so in 2013. Democratic senators worked in 2021 to close the loophole as part of a successful reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, but ultimately dropped the provision in order to secure GOP support to break a filibuster. Sinema is known for her willingness to work with Republicans to cut bipartisan deals, and if this domestic violence provision gets passed in a final deal, it would be a significant win for her approach. “This isn’t something that’s been done overnight,” Robin Lloyd, the managing director of the gun violence prevention group Giffords, told HuffPost. “It’s taken a long time to get there to be greater recognition on the Republican side.” Lloyd cited studies showing states that managed to close the boyfriend loophole saw a 16% drop in intimate partner homicides. Closing the loophole is also important because Americans today are less likely to get married, are getting married later in life, and are dating for a longer period of time before marrying than in the past. “This is so obviously a loophole, so obviously a glaring fact that our laws haven’t caught up with how Americans live,” Lloyd said. “We shouldn’t let domestic abusers have firearms, regardless of how they’re defined under federal law.” Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,GOP Senator Suggests His Party Cares More About Winning Elections Than Gun Laws,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) suggested that November’s midterm elections are animating his party more than efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill in the wake of recent mass shootings across the country. “I think we’re more interested in the red wave than we are in red flags, quite honestly, as Republicans, and we have a pretty good opportunity to do that,” Cramer told reporters on Tuesday after a private caucus lunch that focused on the bipartisan gun violence deal. Many states already have so-called “red flag” laws on the books that allow authorities to temporarily seize firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others. Florida’s GOP legislature passed such law following the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, for example. A bipartisan group of senators is working on drafting legislation aiming to incentivize more states to adopt “red flag” laws, as well as boost school safety and mental health. Ten Republican senators have endorsed an outline of that bill. On Tuesday, they appeared to pick up the support of a key player: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “I’m comfortable with the framework and if the legislation ends up reflecting what the framework indicates, I’ll be supportive,” the Kentucky Republican said at a weekly press conference, adding that polls of gun owners show “overwhelming” support for provisions of the framework. But some GOP lawmakers and conservative pundits are worried that the “red flag” provisions in the agreement could violate Americans’ due process rights before guns are stripped from dangerous individuals. “If we’re not going to pass a federal red flag [law], why would we incentivize states to do something that we think is a bad idea?” Cramer said. The National Rifle Association hasn’t taken an official position on the framework yet, making clear it would wait to do so until the final legislative text is made public. Many Republican senators, fearful of electoral blowback among the GOP base, are taking a similar approach. But opposition on the right is quickly growing. 10 members of the “Surrender Caucus” in the Senate have apparently reached a deal with gun-grabbing Democrats to reduce law-abiding American’s 2nd Amendment rights. When asked if he thought passing the gun violence reform package could hurt his party at the ballot box, Cramer said, “I suppose it could but I think people overwhelmingly want us to do something.” Democrats stressed the “red flag” provisions in the bill aren’t mandatory, that they wouldn’t violate due process rights, as evidenced by their passage in several GOP-controlled states, and that states stand to benefit from other sections in the bill, such as those dealing with mental health and school safety. “The amount of money in this bill for red flags is frankly going to be dwarfed by the amount of money for school safety and mental health,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the lead Democratic negotiator of the bill. The Democratic-controlled House last week passed a more expansive “red flag” bill on a party-line vote. That legislation would allow federal courts to prevent someone who is found to be a danger to themselves or others from obtaining a gun. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Lucy McBath, a Georgia Democrat whose son was shot and killed at a gas station by a man who thought he was playing his music too loudly.

3,"Despite Testimony, Bill Stepien Continues Making Money Spreading Trump’s Election Lies",politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Bill Stepien, who told the Jan. 6 committee that he quit Donald Trump’s campaign after the 2020 election because he could not go along with his election lies, nevertheless continues to coordinate Trump’s political operation, which is built almost entirely on spreading those exact election lies. Stepien’s National Public Affairs firm is currently paid $10,000 a month from Trump’s Save America committee, receiving a total of $130,000 since last May, and taking in another $90,562 from Trump’s reconfigured presidential campaign, according to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. He has also collected an additional $1.2 million from an all-star cast of pro-Trump election liars, including $190,488 from Harriet Hageman, who is trying to unseat Wyoming congresswoman and Jan. 6 committee vice chair Liz Cheney in the August Republican primary. Stepien did not respond to queries from HuffPost about his work for Trump. On Monday, the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol by Trump’s mob played clips from Stepien’s February deposition with committee investigators. In one, Stepien said he has always tried to be “honest and professional” in his work, and that he disagreed with other Trump aides who pushed false conspiracy theories that the election had been stolen from him through massive voter fraud. “I didn’t think what was happening was necessarily honest or professional at that point in time. So, again, that led to me stepping away,” Stepien said. Yet Stepien never really left Trump, with his firm receiving $20,000 in both February and March of 2021, and as much as $30,000 and no less than $10,000 in every month since. His work for Trump to this day, according to an adviser to the former president, is to coordinate Trump’s political strategy, including Trump’s efforts to defeat candidates who challenge his false claim that the election was stolen from him or, worse, voted to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 attack. Each week, Stepien is on an hourlong call with other top Trump aides, including Dan Scavino, Jason Miller, and Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The last such call was June 6; Monday’s call was canceled because it conflicted with the Jan. 6 committee hearing. “He’s trying to tell the world he quit,” the Trump adviser, who is familiar with Trump’s political operation, said on condition of anonymity. “He has been on every call since Jan. 6. He gets paid every month to do that. … I mean, come on, man.” Trump’s political operation since his departure from office 17 months ago has centered on his “big lie” about the 2020 election. It is the central theme of his campaign rallies, and a candidate who refuses to repeat it and spread it cannot get his endorsement. “The election was rigged and stolen,” Trump said at a recent rally in Pennsylvania. “The 2020 Presidential Election was Rigged and Stolen,” he wrote in a post to his Twitter-like social media platform, “Truth Social,” on Friday, the morning after the first Jan. 6 committee hearing. “The so-called ‘Rush on the Capitol’ was not caused by me, it was caused by a Rigged and Stolen Election!” Twelve of Stepien’s other 15 clients running for the House or Senate are also proponents of Trump’s stolen-election lie. Hagemen, one of Stepien’s most lucrative clients, repeatedly refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the 2020 election in a September interview with CNN. “I think that there are legitimate questions about what happened during the 2020 election,” she said, offering no details. “The legitimate questions are: ‘What happened?’” A Cheney spokesman declined to comment on Stepien taking $190,488 from Hagemen’s campaign while casting himself in Monday’s hearing as a member of “Team Normal” who firmly rejected Trump’s lies. Another Stepien client, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, previously and accurately called the state for Biden in 2020. But now that he’s a Senate candidate, he’s been spreading misinformation about the integrity of the state’s election processes. There are “serious concerns” with Arizona’s election results, Brnovich said in April on a podcast with Trump adviser Steve Bannon. “It’s frustrating for all of us, because I think we all know what happened in 2020,” he said, without explanation. Stepien has taken $66,346 from Brnovich’s campaign. Other Stepien clients include Alaska Senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka, who has repeatedly promoted Trump’s lie about a stolen election; Oregon congressional candidate Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who in April refused to give a clear answer on whether Biden won the election; Washington congressional candidate Matt Larkin, who last year declined to say if he thought Biden was the legitimate president; and Ohio Senate candidate Mike Gibbons, who repeatedly spread a lie that millions more people voted in 2020 than were registered to vote. Stepien also counts current members of Congress as his clients, including six who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election based on Trump’s lie ― just hours after that same lie fueled an attempted coup at the Capitol: Reps. Warren Davidson (Ohio), Jason Smith (Mo.), Mary Miller (Ill.), Markwayne Mullin (Okla.), Jeff Van Drew (N.J.) and Ronny Jackson (Texas), who once served as the White House physician. These lawmakers have paid Stepien $487,985 this year, out of the $1.2 million he’s received from congressional candidates. Some of them continue to spread lies about the 2020 election, too. “If you don’t think there was MASSIVE voter fraud in the 2020 election after seeing 2000 Mules, then NOTHING can convince you,” Jackson tweeted last month, using his former patient’s peculiar style of punctuation and capitalization. “The amount of criminal fraud all caught ON CAMERA will SHOCK you! 2020 was NOT ‘free & fair’ at ALL. GO SEE 2000 MULES!!” Jackson was referring to a widely debunked conspiracy theory movie ― which Trump’s own attorney general Bill Barr mocked in his videotaped testimony to the committee ― that claims to show massive voter fraud with ballot drop boxes in the 2020 presidential election. The money Stepien and others receive from Save America has been collected almost entirely from small-dollar donors ― with nearly two-thirds of the $129.6 million raised to date coming in the weeks immediately after the November 2020 election and before Jan. 6, 2021. During that time period, Trump sent out hundreds of solicitations to the millions on his email list, claiming the money would go to his “election defense fund” and to help the two GOP Senate candidates running to keep their offices in a Jan. 5 Georgia runoff. In fact, there was no election defense fund, and none of the money raised went to help the Senate candidates, who both lost to Democratic challengers, giving control of that chamber to New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. “Leadership” political action committees such as Save America operate with few regulations on their spending, and Trump could use the money for virtually anything he wants, including covering his legal expenses or paying himself a salary. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat and Jan. 6 committee member who handled much of the questioning Monday, said a part of the investigation was to look into that fundraising. “Small-dollar donors use scarce disposable income to support candidates and causes of their choosing to make their voices heard. And those donors deserve the truth about what those funds will be used for,” she said during the hearing. “We found evidence that the Trump campaign and its surrogates misled donors as to where their funds would go and what they would be used for. So not only was there the big lie, there was the big rip-off.” The committee is in the midst of holding a series of hearings intended to lay out Trump’s role in stoking anger among his millions of followers following his election loss and then inviting them to Washington, D.C., for the express purpose of intimidating then-Vice President Mike Pence and GOP lawmakers into awarding him a second term anyway. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,"House OKs Security Boost For Supreme Court Judges, Families",politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — The House gave final approval Tuesday to legislation that would allow around-the-clock security protection for families of Supreme Court justices, one week after a man carrying a gun, knife and zip ties was arrested near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house after threatening to kill the justice. The Senate passed the bill unanimously last month, but it languished in the House as Democrats sought to broaden the measure to include protection for families of court employees. Republicans ramped up pressure to pass the bill after the arrest at Kavanaugh’s house, asserting that Democrats were essentially trying to intimidate the justices as the court weighs a potential landmark ruling on abortion. The House passed the security measure overwhelmingly, 396-27. All of the votes in opposition came from Democrats. “By passing this bill as is, we are sending a clear message to left wing radicals: you cannot intimidate Supreme Court justices,” said House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. The Senate voted to expand security protections shortly after the leak of a draft court opinion that would overrule Roe v. Wade and sharply curtail abortion rights in roughly half the states. Supporters of the legislation said threats to the justices have increased since then, with protesters sometimes gathering outside their homes. “We don’t have time to spare when it comes protecting the members of the court and their families,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the bill’s sponsor. “If, heaven forbid, something were to happen ... shame on members of the House of Representatives. It would be on them for their failure to act on this commonsense, bipartisan bill.” Democrats noted that the Supreme Court justices already have round-the-clock security details. They said they also supported extending security to immediate families. But they wanted “one itty bitty concession” to include security for families of court employees, such as the law clerks who work for the justices and help them prepare for cases. “Democrats want to also protect employees and families who are getting threats from right wing activists,” said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. But last week’s arrest clearly brought new emphasis to the bill and new pressure from Republicans seeking a vote. Democrats said they would pursue the protections for families of court employees separately. “We can no longer delay in passing the only version of the bill they would apparently agree to,” Lieu said of Republicans. In the Kavanaugh case, authorities have charged Nicholas John Roske, 26, of Simi Valley, California, with the attempted murder of a justice. Clad in black, he arrived by taxi outside Kavanaugh’s Maryland home around 1 a.m. Wednesday. He spotted two U.S. marshals who were guarding the house and walked in the other direction, calling 911 to say he was having suicidal thoughts and also planned to kill Kavanaugh, according to court documents. Roske said he found the justice’s address on the internet. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Rudy Giuliani Denies Being Drunk On Election Night But Twitter Users Are Skeptical,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rudy Giuliani attempted to deny reports he was giving Donald Trump drunken advice on election night in 2020, but only ended up giving Diet Pepsi the endorsement it probably didn’t want or need. During Monday’s session of the House Jan. 6 committee hearings, former Trump adviser Jason Miller said in a video deposition that the former New York City mayor was “definitely intoxicated” on election night when he told campaign aides that Trump should falsely declare victory. “The mayor was definitely intoxicated, but I do not know his level of intoxication when he spoke with the president,” Miller said. Giuliani denied the allegation Tuesday morning in a now-deleted tweet in which he misspelled the name of Trump campaign staffer Bill Stepien, who also testified that Giuliani said Trump should declare victory even though ballots were still being counted: “I am disgusted and outraged at the out right lie by Jason Miller and Bill Steppien. I was upset that they were not prepared for the massive cheating (as well as other lawyers around the President) I REFUSED all alcohol that evening. My favorite drink..Diet Pepsi” Although Giuliani claimed he didn’t booze it up on Election night, many Twitter users were skeptical. Very skeptical. Good morning, hope you enjoy this unhinged tweet from a man who absolutely doesn't have a drinking problem and claims that diet coke is his favorite drink and not at all alcohol https://t.co/mN7Ytju02R So you were sober?!?!

In fairness to Rudy, his behavior is more like someone who has been eating bath salts than drinking alcohol https://t.co/6baNgQGVPO Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) noted that Giuliani denied being drunk but not the attempt to overturn the election. Rudy Giuliani denies he was drunk when he urged Trump to claim he won the election after all of Trump's advisers said it wasn't true. Believe him or not, but he isn't denying the other evidence we heard about the plot to overturn the election which led to the January 6th attack. https://t.co/buPNuoXxz4 And, of course, many people had thoughs about his supposed beverage of choice. (Minor detail but…he PREFERS Diet Pepsi?!

Last August he told NBC New York, “I’m not an alcoholic. I’m a functioning —” before changing direction midsentence and going with, “I probably function more effectively than 90% of the population.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,"You're 18. You Can't Rent A Car, Hit The Club Or Buy Cigarettes — But You Can Get An AR-15.",politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Assault rifles like the AR-15 are civilian versions of military weapons. They are the weapons of choice in many mass shootings, able to kill large numbers of people quickly. They were used to kill 10 Black people in a Buffalo, New York, supermarket and 19 elementary students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. And many, many more. If you’re 18 years old, you’re not even really considered an adult in a lot of ways. You can’t buy alcohol or cigarettes. You can’t get into a lot of bars and clubs. Don’t think about becoming a Lyft driver, gambling in Vegas or going on a Royal Caribbean cruise alone. In the vast majority of states, you can’t even rent a car or smoke weed either. But you can legally go out and buy an AR-15. Even in the wake of the Buffalo and Ulvade shootings ― carried out by 18-year-olds with AR-15-style rifles ― Republicans in Congress seem wholly uninterested in raising the minimum age for purchasing such a weapon. On Wednesday, the Uvalde pediatrician who treated the victims at Robb Elementary School confronted members of Congress with the consequences of their inaction. “Innocent children all over the country today are dead because laws and policy allows people to buy weapons before they’re legally even old enough to buy a pack of beer,” Dr. Roy Guerrero said.

Patel, a 36-year-old lawyer and business ethics professor at New York University, is running in the Democratic primary against incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Jerry Nadler, who currently represents New York’s 10th District but will now compete in a redrawn 12th after a judge ruled New York’s political maps unconstitutional. Yang said Patel represents part of the next generation of leaders and pledged to help him win. “Do you want someone who is going to be on the verge of retirement the next time Democrats really have a chance to get something done, who is going to be 78, 79, even older?” Yang said. “Or do you want someone who at that point will be in his early 40s, just building seniority and representing this district and community for years and years to come? We know that we need the latter.” Andrew Yang Endorsement! https://t.co/5jvIHNrBpM Yang’s comments about age are consistent with statements he’s made in the past, saying “America is a gerontocracy” and calling for term limits for lawmakers.

The hearing had been set for Wednesday, but the committee on Tuesday morning said that it had been postponed. It did not give a reason or a new date for the hearing. The next hearing is set to take place on Thursday. The witnesses at Wednesday’s hearing were to include Jeffrey Rosen, who was the acting attorney general at the time of the Capitol insurrection, as well as two other former top officials, Richard Donoghue and Steven Engel. Lawyers for all three men did not immediately return messages seeking comment. They were expected to testify about a tense Jan. 3, 2021 meeting at the White House in which then-President Donald Trump weighed whether to replace Rosen with a lower-ranking official, Jeffrey Clark, who had expressed a willingness to champion Trump’s bogus claims of voting fraud.

1,Herschel Walker Used To Brag He Worked In Law Enforcement; He Didn't: Report,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker has bragged about his days working in law enforcement — but it never happened, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday. The former NFL star endorsed by Donald Trump has reportedly talked in the past, before his campaign, about packing a firearm during his time with Georgia’s Cobb County Police Department — and has claimed he was an FBI agent. Neither the police department nor the FBI has any record that Walker ever worked for them, according to the newspaper. Yet Walker claimed in a 2017 speech: “I’ve been in criminal justice all my life,” the Journal-Constitution reported. In 2019 he reportedly said at a speech to soldiers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state: “I spent time at Quantico at the FBI training school. Y’all didn’t know I was an agent?” In 2013 at a suicide prevention event for the Army, Walker said he “worked in law enforcement, so I had a gun. I put this gun in my holster and I said, ‘I’m gonna kill this dude,’” according to the newspaper. (He was apparently referring to an incident in 2001 when he took a gun to chase a man who was late delivering a car. He said he sought mental health treatment afterward.) According to the Journal-Constitution, Walker’s campaign biography says he majored in criminal justice during his time at the University of Georgia (though didn’t graduate) and was an honorary deputy in Cobb County and three other unnamed Georgia counties. The Cobb County sheriff’s office couldn’t confirm he was an “honorary” deputy. But even if he had such a voluntary title, it’s “like a junior ranger badge,” former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan told the Journal-Constitution. Walker would have had no law enforcement authority, Morgan said. When asked to clarify Walker’s law enforcement claims, his campaign sent an Associated Press article saying that he had spent a week at the FBI training school in Quantico doing target practice and running the obstacle course. A college degree and at least 20 weeks at Quantico are required to become an agent, the newspaper said. Walker does have a law enforcement connection from 2001 when he threatened a shootout with cops responding to a domestic disturbance at his home, according to a police report, the Journal-Constitution noted. Walker has stopped mentioning his law enforcement experience since he launched his campaign. The candidate, who is running against first-term Sen. Raphael Warnock (D), has suddenly found himself immersed in controversies since he won the Republican primary and landed in the higher-profile general election. Earlier this month, a political action committee triggered a backlash when it campaigned for Walker at a downtown Atlanta gas station while handing out $25 fuel vouchers. A volunteer claimed it was Walker’s idea, even though federal law prohibits such a relationship between a candidate and a PAC. It’s a felony in Georgia to pay for votes or bribe voters. The state’s voting law even bans volunteers from handing out water to voters while they’re waiting in line at the polls. Walker was recently targeted in a Warnock campaign ad that featured Walker’s boast that he had a magic mist that could “kill” COVID-19. “Is he ready to represent Georgia?” asked the ad. MeidasTouch also released a campaign commercial featuring 10 major Walker “fumbles,” including his pitch for the magic mist. Sen.

2,Biden To Visit Israel And Saudi Arabia Next Month,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will make his first trip to the Middle East next month with visits to Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia, the White House announced Tuesday. The decision to pay a call on Saudi leaders during the July 13-16 trip comes after Biden as a Democratic presidential candidate branded the kingdom a “pariah” because of its human rights record and pledged to recalibrate the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Biden plans to meet with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. U.S. intelligence officials determined Prince Mohammed likely ordered the brutal 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. After Biden took office, his administration made clear the president would avoid direct engagement with the crown prince and instead focus his engagements with King Salman. Human rights advocates and some Democratic allies cautioned Biden about visiting the oil-rich kingdom, saying such a visit without first getting human rights commitments would send a message to Saudi leaders that there are no consequences for egregious rights violations. The Saudis have been accused of using of mass arrests, executions and violence to squelch dissent. But at a time of skyrocketing prices at the gas pump, growing worries about Iran’s nuclear program and perpetual concern that China is expanding its global footprint, Biden and his national security team have determined that freezing out the Saudis, particularly the crown prince, is simply not in the U.S. interest. The White House announced the trip after Saudi Arabia this month helped nudge OPEC+ to ramp up oil production by 648,000 barrels per day in July and August, and the kingdom agreed to extend a United Nations-mediated cease-fire in its seven-year war with Yemen. Biden called the Saudi cease-fire decision “courageous.” Prince Mohammed, who is commonly referred to by his initials, MBS, played a “critical role” in brokering an extension of the cease-fire, according to the administration official. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement announcing the Middle East trip said King Salman invited Biden to visit the kingdom during a gathering in the port city of Jeddah of the six Gulf Cooperation Council nations — Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — as well as Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. “While in Saudi Arabia, the President will also discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues with his counterparts. These include support to the UN-mediated truce in Yemen, which has led to the most peaceful period there since war began seven years ago,” Jean-Pierre said. “He will also discuss means for expanding regional economic and security cooperation, including new and promising infrastructure and climate initiatives, as well as deterring threats from Iran, advancing human rights, and ensuring global energy and food security.” Biden’s first stop during the Middle East swing will be in Israel for a long-planned visit with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in Jerusalem. He will then meet with Palestinian Authority leaders, including Mahmoud Abbas, in the West Bank. Biden will cap the whirlwind trip with the visit to Jeddah for the meeting of GCC leaders and talks with King Salman, the crown prince and other Saudi officials. The trip to Israel comes at a fraught time for Bennett’s fragile coalition, as he tries to avert another election and the potential return to power of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as Iran’s nuclear program continues advancing. Biden’s time in Israel coincides with the Maccabiah Games, a sporting competition that brings together thousands of Jewish and Israeli athletes from around the globe. Biden, who visited Israel for the first time as a young senator nearly 50 years ago, is also expected to meet with athletes taking part in the games. Israeli officials in their engagement with the Biden administration have pressed their point of view that U.S. relations with Arab capitals, including Riyadh, are critical to Israel’s security and overall stability in the region. The visit could also provide an opportunity to kick off talks for what the administration sees as a longer-term project of normalizing Israeli-Saudi relations. Facing questions earlier this month about a potential visit to Saudi Arabia, Biden stressed that the relationship had multiple facets that impact U.S. and Middle East security. “Look, I’m not going to change my view on human rights,” Biden said. “But as president of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can, peace if I can. And that’s what I’m going to try to do.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,These States Will Ban Abortion If Roe Is Overturned,politics," Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. In a matter of weeks, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a seismic opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. If a recent and unprecedented leak from the Court is correct, abortion will be heavily restricted or completely banned in about half of the U.S.’s 50 states. But changes to legal access to abortion, while radical and widespread, will happen unevenly under a patchwork of varying state laws. Overturning Roe just means states are free to decide how to, or if, to allow access to abortion services. Sixteen states will immediately, or in short order, ban abortions in almost all circumstances for residents. Legal disputes are expected to arise in two more states to decide whether abortion bans passed before 1973 can come back into effect or not. Thirteen states have trigger laws banning abortion that were passed to go into effect when the court overturned Roe. These laws will go into effect immediately, or in a short period of time, once the court rules. Another five states have pre-Roe abortion bans that are still on the books and could be resurrected. Legal disputes are already underway or expected in two of these states, and in another it is unclear whether the pre-Roe law or an unconstitutional post-Roe law will go into effect. Another four states will effectively ban abortion by only allowing abortions to be performed prior to the detection of a fetal heartbeat, which occurs as early as six-weeks. Further, any state fully controlled by Republicans could move to ban or tightly restrict abortion with new legislation now that the court has struck down the reproductive rights granted in Roe. A Florida law restricting abortion after 15-weeks is also likely go into effect upon Roe’s demise. Other states under total GOP control and where the right to an abortion is not protected under the state constitution, like Nebraska, could pass new laws banning or heavily restricting abortion after the court hands down its ruling in Dobbs. Here is a guide to what will change, and where. In 2005, South Dakota became the first state to enact a trigger law that would ban abortion immediately, or in short order, after either the Supreme Court overturned Roe or the states enacted a new constitutional amendment banning abortion. These trigger laws were spurred by the confirmation of conservative justices that anti-abortion lawmakers knew opposed the right to an abortion. The first wave of trigger laws came after Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a conservative justice who still backed abortion rights, announced her retirement. Anti-abortion lawmakers saw O’Connor’s retirement and replacement by Justice Samuel Alito as a harbinger that they were getting close to achieving success. A second wave of trigger laws came more recently after the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, along with O’Connor, prevented Roe from being overturned in the Casey v. Planned Parenthood decision. Kennedy’s replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh spurred a flurry of new trigger laws that only increased after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg died in 2020 and was swiftly replaced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Arkansas The state’s 2021 trigger law immediately bans all abortions within the state except those where it would be necessary to save the life of the mother. The law punishes doctors who perform abortions with up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $100,000. The state may revisit the law’s lack of exceptions for rape and incest, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) said in May. Idaho Idaho’s trigger law banning most abortions in the state takes effect 30 days after Roe is overturned. The law punishes doctors performing abortions with a minimum of two years in prison. The only exceptions to the law are abortions to save the life of the mother and when a patient can show evidence of a report field with law enforcement alleging that the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Some Republicans in the state, like Lt. Gov. Janice McEachin (R), are calling for even stricter laws, including eliminating the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother and pushing to classify abortion as felony murder. Kentucky The trigger law banning abortion in almost all cases goes into effect immediately. The law only provides an exception for abortions to save the mother’s life. Louisiana Louisiana’s 2006 trigger law immediately bans almost all abortions in the state except in circumstances where the mother’s life is at risk. The law punishes abortion providers with up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $100,000. Louisiana’s law is the only one passed by a state government fully controlled by Democrats at the time. Republicans in the state legislature considered legislation classifying abortion as a homicide this year. Such a law would make it possible for women obtaining an abortion to be charged with murder. After a wave of negative press, the bill did not advance. Mississippi The state’s 2007 trigger law would ban almost all abortions in the state within 10 days of the decision overturning Roe. The law grants exceptions in the case of rape and when it would save the life of the mother. Missouri A 2019 trigger law immediately bans abortion in the state, except to save the mother’s life or prevent serious bodily harm, upon certification from the governor, attorney general or legislature that Roe has been overturned. The law would penalize anyone who induces an abortion with between five to 15 years in prison. It does not state whether or not a woman taking abortion drugs could be charged under the statute for inducing her own abortion. North Dakota The state immediately bans almost all abortions except in the case of rape, incest or the where mother’s life is at risk under its trigger law passed in 2007. Oklahoma Oklahoma’s trigger law banning all abortions except in cases where necessary to save the life of the mother goes into effect immediately. The Republican-run state government passed a new law in May increasing penalties for performing an abortion to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine up to $100,000. South Dakota The state’s 2005 trigger law ― the first one passed in the country ― immediately bans all abortions except to save the life of the mother. The law bans both medical abortions and the provision or prescription of any abortion drug to a pregnant woman. The punishment is up to two years in prison and a fine up to $4,000. Gov. Kristi Noem (R) said that she would call a special legislative session in the event Roe is overturned. The session is not necessary to trigger the state’s abortion ban, but could be used to enact further restrictions like banning companies from reimbursing employees for out-of-state travel to obtain an abortion. Tennessee Tennessee enacted a trigger law in 2019 that bans all abortions except in when the life of the mother is at risk. Abortion providers would face three to 15 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 for performing an abortion in the state. The law goes into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Texas Almost all abortions will be banned within 30 days after Roe is overturned under Texas’ trigger law. The only exception to the law is if the mother’s life is in danger. Providers performing an abortion could face life in prison and a fine of at least $100,000. Utah The state’s 2020 trigger law banning almost all abortions in the state goes into effect as soon as the legislative general counsel affirms that the court has overturned Roe. The law bans all abortions except in the case of rape, incest, severe birth defects causing the baby to die shortly after being born or be born into a mentally vegetative state and the life of the mother is in danger. The rape and incest exceptions can only be used if the act was previously reported to law enforcement. Wyoming Wyoming’s trigger law banning most abortions goes into effect five days after the governor certifies that Roe is overturned. The law bans all abortions except in the cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother is in danger. Eight states have pre-Roe abortion bans still on their books, but three of those states have since enacted trigger ban laws that will take precedence over the old laws enjoined by court orders since 1973. Some of the five states that still have pre-Roe laws on the books and no trigger ban law are likely to see the old law challenged in court before it can come back into effect. Alabama Alabama still has a pre-Roe abortion ban on its books that has been enjoined by a court order since 1973. The pre-Roe law provides an exception for the life of the mother and punishes abortion providers up to one year in prison and a maximum fine of $1,000. While this law may now be resurrected, it could also be superseded by an unconstitutional law the state enacted in 2019. That law, which was passed with the hopes that it would lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, similarly bans abortion in the state but carries much stiffer penalties. A provider performing an abortion could face up to 99 years in prison under the post-Roe law and up to 10 years for attempting to perform an abortion. Which law goes into effect may be decided in the courts, unless the state government, dominated by Republicans, passes a new law superseding both prior laws. Arizona A near-total abortion ban suspended by the court’s decision in Roe in 1973 could be revived if Roe is overturned. The law includes an exception for the life of the mother. But Gov. Doug Ducey (R) wants a newer law banning abortion after 15 weeks that was passed in 2022 to supersede the old ban. “This law was signed this year,″ Ducey said in April. “I think that the law that you signed in 2022 supersedes 1973.″ The author of the 15-week ban law, however, said that the law includes a provision declaring that the 2022 law does not supersede the pre-Roe abortion ban if it were to become valid again. This matter will likely be decided in court. Michigan Michigan retains a pre-Roe abortion ban law enacted in 1931 on its books. The law, which includes an exception for the life of the mother, was suspended by a court order in 1973. In anticipation that the law could come back to life, Planned Parenthood and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) filed lawsuits in state court to block the old law from being revived. A Michigan Court of Claims judge found the law in violation of the state’s constitution in May as part of the lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood. Whitmer continues to press the state Supreme Court to rule that the right to an abortion is protected under the state’s constitution. The pre-Roe law will remain suspended, leaving abortion legal in the state as the two lawsuits continue to move through the state’s court system. State Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) said that she would not enforce the pre-Roe law’s ban on abortion if it is revived, but noted that she would have no power over local prosecutors who choose to enforce it. West Virginia A 19th century abortion ban in West Virginia would come back to life if Roe is overturned. The law punishes abortion providers with three to 10 years of prison. It contains an exception for the life of the mother. Wisconsin The state’s 1849 abortion ban would be revived if Roe is overturned. The law punishes providers with up to six years in prison, or up to 10 years if the pregnancy is quick (the fetus is moving, which normally happens between 16 and 20 weeks). It includes an exception for the life of the mother. State Attorney General John Kaul (D) said he will not enforce the law, but he’d have no power to stop local prosecutors from doing so. Gov. Tony Evers (D) supports overturning the law, but the heavily-gerrymandered Republican legislature wants to keep the law and enhance its restrictions. The 2022 midterm elections may change things as the Republican challenger to Kaul says he would enforce the law statewide if elected and the challengers to Evers would sign legislation further restricting abortion access passed by the legislature. Georgia Georgia enacted a six-week abortion ban in 2019 that bans abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The law was blocked by the courts from going into effect, but will likely be enforceable if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. A six-week ban will function as a near-total ban on abortion as many women do not even know if they are pregnant at six weeks. The law contains exceptions in the case of medical emergencies, rape and incest. The latter two exceptions can only be approved if a report is filed with law enforcement. Iowa Iowa Republicans passed legislation in 2018 banning abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be identified ― usually around six weeks into a pregnancy. The state Supreme Court, however, ruled that the law was unconstitutional, as it violated a 2018 court decision that found a right to abortion in the state’s constitution. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) and Republican legislators have asked the state Supreme Court to overturn that 2018 decision as it considers the constitutionality of another restrictive abortion law. They hope the court will reach a result to their liking since Reynolds has appointed four judges to the court since 2018. If the court overturns its 2018 precedent then abortion will be banned at around six weeks. The state may also take further action to enact a total abortion ban. Ohio Abortion would be banned in Ohio at around six weeks, according to the state’s “fetal heartbeat” law. A federal court blocked the law from going into effect since it violated Roe’s grant of reproductive rights. The state’s six-week abortion ban would go into effect after the court’s order blocking it is lifted. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) stated that he would sign a law completely banning abortion. The state legislature considered legislation to enact a trigger ban to go into effect when Roe is overturned, but put that bill on hold to see what the Supreme Court would do first. South Carolina South Carolina enacted a six-week “fetal heartbeat” ban law in 2021. Like the laws in Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina, a federal court blocked the law from going into effect. Once the court lifts the block on the law, it will be illegal to obtain an abortion in the state when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. South Carolina Republicans considered legislation totally banning abortion in 2022, but did not pass it. That may change if Roe is overturned. Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,The 23 States Set To Ban Abortions Offer Little Support For Parents And Children,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. If states insist on restricting reproductive rights, the least they could do is provide assistance for those parents and their new children. But they aren’t really doing that. HuffPost examined 23 states that are set to restrict or ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this summer, as it seems poised to do. We looked at whether they offer benefits such as paid family leave, universal pre-K, tax credits aimed at helping families and medical assistance. The 23 states generally did not score well. Three states ― Mississippi, South Dakota and Wyoming ― didn’t offer any of the seven benefits we examined. Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia scored the best, with four benefits. In comparison, for example, California and New York ― both states with abortion protections on the books ― provide every single one of the benefits. “In the absence of federal action, overturning Roe will be especially devastating in the states poised to ban abortion,” said Osub Ahmed, associate director of women’s health and rights at the Center for American Progress. “Most of these states have failed to develop policies or invest in programs that support mothers and their families, setting up women forced to continue a pregnancy for failure.” In addition to the metrics examined by HuffPost, Ahmed noted that fewer 10 of these states require a minimum wage beyond the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. A look at some of the measures we used: Paid Family Leave: Zero of the 23 states set to restrict abortion offer paid family leave. The United States is one of the few countries in the world that doesn’t offer this benefit. While there is a federal law that provides up to 12 weeks off of work to have a baby, it is unpaid time. It also applies only to companies with 50 or more employees, and to employees who have been employed there for a full year. Medicaid Expansion: The Medicaid program pays for about 4 in 10 births in the United States, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Affordable Care Act dramatically expanded who qualifies for Medicaid coverage, bringing health insurance to more people. But 12 states did not accept the expansion ― including 10 that are set to restrict abortion rights. Full Or Mostly Universal Pre-K: Five states in our group offer full or mostly universal pre-K ― a benefit available in just 11 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Those states serve at least 70% of their 4-year-old population or have committed to the goal of universal pre-K. State Earned Income Tax Credit: The federal earned income tax credit provides low- and middle-income taxpayers a refundable credit based on income, marital status, number of children and other measurements. More than half of states also offer a state EITC, including nine of the 23 states set to restrict abortion. (Utah and Missouri are included in this list, although they won’t go into effect until 2023, according to the Urban Institute.) State Child Tax Credit: The popular federal child tax credit provides tax relief to families based on their number of children. Only Oklahoma and Idaho offer a state child tax credit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, although unlike the federal one, it is nonrefundable. Pregnant Workers Protections: Nine states on this list have laws requiring some employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers, such as transferring them to a different position that is less hazardous. 12-Month Medicaid Postpartum Extension: Federal law requires Medicaid coverage for pregnancy-related expenses up to 60 days postpartum. The Affordable Care Act also gave states the option to extend that coverage for up to 12 months. Ten states that plan to restrict abortion rights have, or are planning to, implement this extension. Of course, the benefits here are just a small slice of what’s needed to help families ― and support is needed long after the children are babies and toddlers. But right now, for many GOP politicians, the focus isn’t even on helping parents and babies. Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Trump Impeachment Lawyer Tells Jan. 6 Hearing That Rigged Vote Claims Were 'Nuts',politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A Trump White House attorney derided election conspiracy theories by Donald Trump allies as “nuts” in videotape testimony played at a hearing Monday by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eric Herschmann, who defended Trump at his first impeachment trial, was appalled by schemes to overthrow the presidential election to keep the former president in office. Hershmann particularly lambasted the incredible scenario of voting corruption pitched by long-time Trump henchman Rudy Giuliani and lawyer Sidney Powell. They concocted a confusing scheme that somehow had dead Venezuela dictator Hugo Chavez manipulating Dominion Voting System machines to affect the vote in America. “What they were proposing, I thought, was nuts — in theory was also completely nuts, right?” Herschmann said in his testimony as he shook his head. “It was a combination of Italians, the Germans, different things that had been floating around as to who was involved ... Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelans. She has an affidavit from somebody who says they wrote a software [program], and something with the Philippines — just all over their radar,” he added with disgust.

Herschmann also blasted a detailed scheme to overturn the election by “coup-memo” attorney John Eastman. “Are you out of your effing mind?” Herschmann said he confronted the lawyer the day after the insurrection. “I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on: ‘Orderly transition,’” he added.

13,"2022 Midterms: What To Watch In Maine, Nevada, North Dakota And South Carolina",politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Primary voters on Tuesday will decide the fate of two South Carolina Republicans who are clinging to their seats in the U.S. House after defying Donald Trump, while in Nevada an establishment favorite with the former president’s endorsement is facing a tougher than expected challenge for the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, in Maine, a bellicose former governor who once said he was “Trump before Trump” has come out of retirement in Florida to challenge a nemesis for his old job. Primary contests in South Carolina, Nevada and Maine on Tuesday will offer the latest test of the Trump political brand. North Dakota is also holding elections, though Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven doesn’t face a serious challenger. What to watch: Trump has backed former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt for the U.S. Senate and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo for governor. Just how well they do on Tuesday will gauge the potency of a Trump endorsement, which has delivered mixed results this midterm campaign season. Laxalt’s political pedigree has helped make him a front-runner. His grandfather Paul Laxalt was a Nevada governor and senator. And Laxalt’s father is late U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who publicly acknowledged his paternity for the first time in 2013. Besides Trump, Laxalt also has the endorsement of much of Washington’s GOP establishment as he seeks to run in November against first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is considered among the most vulnerable senators. But Laxalt, who was largely raised near Washington, D.C., and served as a judge advocate general in the Navy, has faced a stronger than anticipated challenge. Retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, a West Point graduate and Purple Heart recipient who was badly burned in Afghanistan, is running as a conservative outsider. He has drawn crowds and has won the support of those who view Laxalt as too cozy with the establishment. He also has the endorsement of the Nevada Republican Party. In the governor’s race, Lombardo, the head of the Las Vegas Police Department, is hoping to face Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in November. But first he has to get past a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and Joey Gilbert, a lawyer and former boxer, who was outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Beyond the marquee races, the state’s Republican primary for secretary of state will also offer a measure of Trump’s enduring grip on the GOP. Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, is leaving office because of term limit laws. In 2020, she refused to cave to Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn his defeat in the state’s presidential election, vowing she would not “put my thumb on the scale of democracy.” Six Republicans are vying for the seat, including  Jim Marchant, a former state lawmaker who has embraced Trump’s lies about widespread voter fraud in the state. His website makes his position abundantly clear: My “number one priority will be to overhaul the fraudulent election system in Nevada.” Democrats have united behind secretary of state candidate Cisco Aguilar, an attorney who previously worked for Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader who died last year. Loyalty can be a fickle thing for Trump. And a perceived lack of it is the driving force behind heated primary challenges to two South Carolina Republicans in the U.S. House. Rep. Nancy Mace worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign and earned his endorsement when she ousted incumbent Democrat Joe Cunningham from a coastal swing district four years later. But shortly after her swearing-in, a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, and Mace went on national TV to declare that Trump’s “entire legacy was wiped out” by the attack. Trump was furious and recruited a challenger, former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who helped oust Mark Sanford from the U.S. House in 2018. In Congress, Mace has sought to mend fences — sort of. She voted against Trump’s second impeachment and opposed the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate the origins of the Jan. 6 attack, which was inspired by Trump’s lies about a stolen election. But she also voted to hold former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the Jan. 6 investigation. And she has feuded publicly with Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a far-right flamethrower and Trump acolyte. Mace is not the only South Carolina candidate to draw his ire. Trump also solicited challengers to primary U.S. Rep. Tom Rice, after he voted to impeach the the president over the Jan. 6 insurrection. Now Rice is facing six other Republicans, all of whom have cited the impeachment vote as a chief motivator to their campaigns. Trump eventually settled on endorsing state Rep. Russell Fry, who has run TV ads likening Rice to villains including Satan. Fry told voters during a recent debate that “we’re going to vote to impeach Tom Rice at the ballot box.” Rice, on on the other hand, has focused on important but far more mundane matters, like his successes securing flood remediation funding and assistance for the region’s farmers over his five terms in office. Maine’s gubernatorial primaries are a mere formality, with one Democrat and one Republican seeking the office. But they will lock in what promises to be a doozy of a general election, pitting two longtime foes against each other. Democratic incumbent Janet Mills is seeking a second term. She’s a former district attorney, state lawmaker and Maine attorney general who frequently clashed with Republican Paul LePage when he was governor. Now he is challenging her. That the two are even competing against each other is somewhat of a surprise. LePage, who once described himself as “Trump before there was Trump,” moved to Florida after leaving office in 2019 following two raucous terms that often drew national attention for his indecorous remarks. But the draw of elected office was apparently too great. By 2020, he was back in Maine pledging to challenge his old nemesis, whom he accuses of “reckless spending” and “heavy-handed” pandemic directives. So far, LePage lags in fundraising behind Mills, but the race is expected to be among the most competitive governor’s races in the country this year. ___ Associated Press writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., David Sharp in Portland, Maine, and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nev., contributed to this report.

14,Fox News Analyst: Republicans Will Secretly Be 'Glad' If Jan. 6 Panel Damages Trump,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume suggested that many elected Republicans are secretly hoping that the Jan. 6 House select committee ruins Donald Trump’s chances of running for president again in 2024. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol is presenting its findings in a series of hearings this month. In the second hearing on Monday, it laid out evidence that Trump and his inner circle knew his claims of a rigged election were false but pushed them widely anyway, utilizing them to raise millions of dollars while seeking to overturn the 2020 election and stay in power. During analysis on Monday’s “Special Report,” host Bret Baier asked Hume if the committee was trying to make a legal or political case against Trump. “Well, I think they’re doing both,” Hume said. “What strikes me about this, Bret, is that if they succeed ― either by damaging him or staining him such that he is either unable for legal or political reasons to run again ― they might end up finding out that they’ve done the Republican Party a great service,” he added. “Because I think a great many Republicans think they can’t win with Trump at the head of the ticket again. “They’re afraid of his supporters and don’t want to come out against him directly. But they’d like him to go away. If the effect of this committee is to make his possible candidacy go away, I think a great many Republicans would privately be very glad.” Hume: If they succeed by staining him such that he is unable for legal or political reasons to run again, they might find out they’ve done the GOP a great service because I think a great number of Republicans think they can’t win with Trump… they’d like him to go away pic.twitter.com/g1JwKtct8w The committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans ― Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), both of whom have loudly criticized Trump at risk to their own political careers. Tim Miller, a former spokesperson for the Republican National Committee and writer for The Bulwark, commented that Hume’s analysis was pretty close to the mark: Ol' @brithume is sooooo close to getting it! It's almost as if some Democrats and Never Trumpers are trying to do the right thing, not plotting how they might best help themselves politically! A shocking concept for some I'm aware. https://t.co/1RrkBPUCVk Hume’s commentary also attracted criticism from conservatives and Fox News viewers. The conservative analyst has been critical of Trump and, in January 2021, said the former president’s claims of election fraud were “utter balderdash” that likely led to the Capitol riot.

15,Jan. 6 Testimony Details Chilling Threats To Family After Trump's Tweet Names GOP Official,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost In one of the most troubling parts of Monday’s hearing of the House select committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, a former Philadelphia city commissioner testified that Donald Trump supporters targeted his family following false and vicious tweets about the 2020 election in which the former president singled him out. Republican Al Schmidt was one of three commissioners who investigated claims of election fraud in Pennsylvania, none of which withstood careful examination. Schmidt told the House panel that while “general” threats were relatively common against the commissioners during the election investigations, the situation became truly frightening when Trump tweeted “at me by name, calling me out ... [and] threats became much more specific, much more graphic.” They then included “not just me” but also “members of my family by name, their ages, our address, pictures of our home, just every bit of detail that you can imagine. That was what changed with that tweet,” Schmidt testified.

He pointed out then that the “former POTUS incited supporters to threaten to kill my children and put their ‘heads on spikes’ because we counted votes cast by eligible voters.” .@LeaderMcConnell The former POTUS incited supporters to threaten to kill my children and put their “heads on spikes” because we counted votes cast by eligible voters. They named my children and included my home address in the threats. Please consider when voting your conscience. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who was questioning Schmidt at the hearing, showed on a video screen some of the threatening messages Schmidt had received following the Trump tweet. Identifying information and some of the details of the threatened violence had been redacted. The situation underscored the panel’s repeated point that incendiary lies relentlessly repeated by a president to trusting supporters do not occur in a vacuum; they can spark threats — and even violence. Zofgren apologized for what Schmidt went through. Part of Schmidt’s testimony included video clips from the House panel, including a section from a year ago showing Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — apparently snatching a figure out of the air — claiming that 8,021 “dead people” voted in the presidential election in Pennsylvania. He sarcastically quipped that it’s “easier for dead people to submit mail-in ballots than it is to vote in person.” Schmidt responded to that claim: “Not only was there not evidence of 8,000 dead voters voting in Pennsylvania, there wasn’t evidence of eight” such “voters.” Yet, he said, every single election complaint — “no matter how fantastical, how absurd” — was taken seriously and carefully investigated.

16,'Theater': Senate Republicans Tune Out Jan. 6 Hearings,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The hearings in the House about Jan. 6, 2021, have made plenty of news so far, thanks to extraordinary testimony from a number of former Donald Trump administration officials and aides who debunked the ex-president’s lies about the 2020 election and shed more light on his state of mind during the attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Senate Republicans say they’re not paying attention to any of it, nor do they intend to. “Why? Theater?” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who voted to convict Trump over his role in inciting the riot, told HuffPost when asked if he planned to tune in. “I don’t have time,” added Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), explaining he was instead focused on passing an appropriations bill. During Monday’s hearing before the bipartisan House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, investigators laid out proof that the former president’s staffers had told him that he had lost reelection but that he attempted to remain in power anyway. In one video clip, former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said Trump disregarded his advice and that of other top campaign aides to tell supporters that votes were still being counted and that “it was too early to call the race.” Instead, Trump continued to lie about the election, a move Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr, called “bogus and silly.” “If he really believes this stuff, I thought he’d lost contact, or become detached from reality,” Barr told the Jan. 6 committee. Last week, in a separate prime-time hearing, the committee aired an interview with Trump’s own daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, who said she took Barr’s comments seriously. The House panel also shared testimony from inside the White House alleging that Trump welcomed his supporters’ chants calling for his Vice President Mike Pence to be hanged. None of these developments seemed to move Republicans this week, however. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who previously criticized Trump over the riot, simply ignored questions about it. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) quipped that he would be sure to “catch the highlights on NFL Network.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) was the only Republican senator interviewed by HuffPost who addressed the hearings on Monday. The testimony from former Trump administration officials, Romney said, indicated “just how pervasive the view was that there was no credibility whatsoever to the idea that the election was not entirely legal.” Asked specifically about Trump’s alleged comment about Pence, Romney said the former president had made many comments “so beyond the pale it’s hard to respond to each of them.” Democrats, meanwhile, said they were impressed with how the Jan. 6 committee had centered its case on the testimony of former Trump administration officials. “They are definitely building a case [to indict Trump],” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. “As to whether it will justify prosecution for the Justice Department’s very high bar? I don’t know.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Trump Aide Bashes William Barr As A 'Shill' For Marxists After Damning Testimony,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump’s spokesperson Liz Harrington bashed former U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Monday as a “shill” for “Marxist Democrats” after his damning testimony against the former president was aired by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Barr is among the last people on Earth who could be described as a Marxist sympathizer. He has long been a proponent of boosting the power of the chief executive in America — not part of the Marxist ideology. Critics slammed Barr during his tenure in the Trump administration for attempting to create a more “king-like” president far less constrained by Congress and the courts. Barr apparently radically changed his stripes, from Harrington’s perspective, as he recounted to the House select committee that various investigations into the 2020 presidential election exposed the Trump camp’s complaints that the voting was rigged as “bullshit.” He testified that he explained that to Trump repeatedly but that the then-president never showed “interest in what the actual facts were.” Harrington posted her comment on Truth Social, which appears to consistently block all negative responses to right-wing users. But there was major blowback — and plenty of laughs — in responses to Twitter retweets of Harrington’s message: Trump spokesperson says Bill Barr is now a Marxist. pic.twitter.com/0k4Y94Xw4H Why does Donald Trump keep hiring all these crypto-Marxists?! Don said it himself-he only hires the best people 🙃 Which Marx brother though? I think he's Harpo, but others may differ. Eating their own now That's news to Bill Barr. That’s pretty hilarious.

2,Mick Mulvaney Trashes Trump Staffers As 'Garbage' And Twitter Users Pounce,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney slammed the people who stayed with Donald Trump at the end of his presidency as “garbage” on Monday ― only to have Twitter users remind him of his own trashy antics. Mulvaney, who was serving as a U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland at the time of the Jan. 6 insurrection and resigned a few days later, suggested that when a person surrounds themselves with people like Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and Peter Navarro, bad things are bound to happen. Trump's inner circle at the end was...Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Lin Wood, Peter Navarro... Garbage in.  Garbage out. Considering Mulvaney openly admitted ― and approved ― of the quid pro quo between his former boss and Ukraine that led to his first impeachment, many Twitter users trashed the current CBS paid on-air contributor’s “garbage in, garbage out” comment.

3,'Absolutely Not Worthless': Democrats Are Learning To Love A Small-Scale Gun Deal,politics," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Tens of thousands of people showed up Saturday for more than 450 March for Our Lives rallies around the country, where speakers called for universal background checks and a ban on the sale of assault weapons ― or, at the very least, a requirement that Americans to be at least 21 years old before being able to buy an assault rifle. On Sunday, the student-led group behind the rallies somewhat reluctantly endorsed an emerging Senate gun violence deal that would accomplish none of those things. “In a less-broken society, we would be able to require background checks every single time someone wants to buy a gun, and we would ban assault rifles outright,” David Hogg, the group’s co-founder and a survivor of the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in 2018. “But if even one life is saved or one attempted mass shooting is prevented because of these regulations, we believe that it is worth fighting for.” As a bipartisan group of 20 senators works to finalize what is likely to be the first major piece of gun control legislation in three decades, Democrats are resigning themselves to take a small victory, hoping it could minimize the GOP’s fear of political blowback and pave the way for future action toward gun control. Democratic support for the legislation in Congress will be almost unanimous. “We could maybe score more political points against Republicans, but we wouldn’t save lives, and that’s my priority,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who helped negotiate the package. “If Republicans learn that history and good politics err on the side of saving lives and they want to do more because it will actually get them both, OK.” Still, a small group of Democratic operatives and strategists are worried about the downsides of taking such an incremental deal, fearful it will allow Republicans to claim they’ve taken action on a key issue while doing little to actually lower the 45,000-a-year death toll from gun violence or decrease the number of weapons in America. “This is absolutely not worthless. This is a strong package. This is going to save lives,” Robin Lloyd, the managing director at the gun control group Giffords, told reporters on a conference call Sunday afternoon as details of the deal emerged. “Even if this does not have everything in it that a lot of folks would like to see, it is still really important to do.” Senators are still ironing out the final details of the agreement and writing the legislation, but an announcement on Sunday indicated the proposal would incentivize states to pass so-called “red flag” laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others, enhance background checks for buyers younger than 21, close the “boyfriend loophole” that had allowed some domestic abusers to buy weapons, invest in mental health and school safety programs, and increase penalties for straw purchasers who buy guns for others. President Joe Biden, who has backed expanded background checks, a ban on assault weapons and the elimination of a liability shield for gun manufacturers, is supporting the deal despite playing little role in its development. “Does this framework have everything that the president wants or everything that the president has called for? It does not,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Monday’s press briefing, noting that the families of gun violence victims in Texas and New York had pleaded with the president to “do something” when he met with them. Momentum built for this legislation following the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, and the racist killing of 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on May 14. But a prior wave of mass shootings in 2020, in the midst of the Democratic presidential primaries, brought far more ambitious proposals: Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas endorsed mandatory gun buybacks to shrink the number of guns in the United States (there are now roughly 121 guns for every 100 Americans) and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts proposed gun licensing programs. Warren backed stiff increases in the taxes on guns and ammunition. In an interview Monday, Warren supported the current deal and said the party needed to continue to apply political pressure on congressional Republicans, most of whom are not expected to back even the bipartisan deal. “These are people who haven’t moved in decades on guns,” she told HuffPost. “It’s a sign of how much heat they’re feeling that they move even an inch. Our job is to push these Republicans as hard as we can. No one’s giving up. Once this bill passes, we’re going to get right back at it asking for a ban on assault weapons, asking for raising the age on gun ownership.” Years of gridlock have also taken a toll on progressives, who are eager to embrace any progress. “Even moving the ball forward a few yards is worth doing,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said. “I’ve been in Congress six years. We haven’t done anything for six years of any substance.” Gun control remains politically popular: An NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted earlier this month found that 59% of Americans say preventing gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights, the highest that number has been in a decade, while 35% say protecting gun rights is more important. The same survey found many of the proposal’s provisions were popular with the public: 86% of voters said they would definitely support a candidate who wants to increase mental health funding, while 82% said the same of a candidate who supports background checks and 78% would back a candidate who supported red flag laws. Various gun violence proposals not included in the package were less popular. The public was split on an assault weapon ban: While 56% of all voters said they would vote for a candidate who backed one, the proposal was underwater among independent voters. Allowing teachers to arm themselves was flatly unpopular, with just 38% of voters saying they would support a candidate who backed the idea. The popularity of gun control measures is part of the reason some Democrats fear a deal could be a risk, potentially letting the GOP, which has held up any serious action on gun violence for decades, off the hook politically while doing little to solve the problem. “The real question is whether this deal advances the cause of passing something that actually matters or sets it back,” Adam Jentleson, a top staffer for the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, wrote on Twitter. “The illusion of progress can be a net negative.” There’s also reason to be skeptical the coalition passing this legislation can stick together: Of the 10 Republicans publicly backing the deal, five are in what they say will be their last term in office. Senators are hopeful for a final vote later this month, but wrangling over the bill’s text and how to pay for the legislation could still derail the process. Blumenthal noted the gun lobby has yet to attack the legislation. “It’s hard for them to oppose motherhood and apple pie. Once they see the language, they will try to eviscerate it,” he said.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer.

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,7 Key Moments From The Second Jan. 6 Hearing,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost In its second public hearing, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol delivered a relatively focused message on Monday: that Trump knew his claims of a stolen election were false but continued to push them widely, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars while seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “This morning, we’ll tell the story of how Donald Trump lost an election and knew he lost an election, and as a result of his loss, decided to wage an attack on our democracy,” Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told the audience in opening remarks. Thompson characterized the effort to discredit the 2020 election as a “conspiracy” and a “scheme” that Trump oversaw and directed and that is “unprecedented in American history.” Here are seven key moments from the hearing: Numerous Trump campaign staffers testified that Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was inebriated at Trump’s election night watch party and insisted on telling Trump to declare victory regardless of the actual data coming in. Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, told investigators that Giuliani appeared to have had too much to drink. Former Trump adviser Jason Miller also said the former New York City mayor “was definitely intoxicated.” While Stepien, Miller and others, including Trump’s daughter Ivanka, apparently believed it was too early to declare victory on election night, Trump ended up listening to a tipsy Giuliani and falsely declared victory anyway. Stepien said he’d told Trump to deliver a speech “that the votes were still being counted, it’s too early to tell, too early to call the race, but that we were proud of the race we ran” and that he’d “have more to say about this the next day.” “The president disagreed with that,” Stepien said. “He thought I was wrong; he told me so and that they were going to go in a different direction.” As Giuliani’s schemes to undercut the 2020 election results became apparent, Stepien said, an internal schism formed and Stepien’s group lost Trump’s ear. “There were 2 groups: my team, and Rudy’s team,” he said. “I didn’t mind being categorized as ‘team normal.’” “I’ve been doing this for a long time, 25 years, and I’ve spanned political ideologies from Trump to Christie to Bush,” Stepien continued, “and I think along the way, I built up a pretty good reputation for being honest, and I didn’t think what was happening was either honest or professional at that point, so I stepped away.” Chris Stirewalt, a former political editor at Fox News, testified that Trump sold voters on a “red mirage” on election night before all of the votes had been counted. Stirewalt, whom Fox News fired after he correctly called Arizona for Joe Biden, explained that early votes typically skew Republican, while others, like mail-in ballots, typically don’t. So it was very premature for Trump to declare victory based only on the early returns. “As of Nov. 7, in your judgment, what were the chances of President Trump winning the election?” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) asked Stirewalt. “After that point? None,” he said, shaking his head. Stirewalt also threw cold water on the notion that any outcomes in battleground states would have been reversed in a recount. “Normally, you’re talking about hundreds of votes, maybe 300 votes that are going to change” in a recount, he said. “So the idea that through any normal process, in any of these states ― remember, he had to do it thrice, right? ― he needed three of these states to change.” “In order to do that, I mean, you’re at an infinite ― you’re better off to play the Powerball.” Former Attorney General William Barr told the committee that Trump was increasingly “detached from reality” as he asserted, again and again, that the election was stolen. Barr said the Department of Justice investigated any “specific and credible allegations” of fraud, but the claims “were completely bogus and silly and usually based on complete misinformation.” Barr reserved particular scorn for the conspiracy theory pushed by Trump, Giuliani and others that Dominion Voting Systems, a voting machine company, had altered its machines to falsely tabulate votes. “They were idiotic claims,” he said, but “they were made in such a sensational way they were influencing members of the public” and “doing a grave disservice to the country.” “My opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud, and I haven’t seen anything since the election that changed my mind on that,” Barr said. Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager, sharply criticized the state of the then-president’s 2020 reelection effort when he was hired to replace outgoing campaign manager Brad Parscale just 115 days before Election Day. “I inherited a campaign that was, the day I was hired, was President Trump’s low point in the daily average polling against Biden,” Stepien said. “It was structurally and fiscally deficient. There was a great deal wrong with the campaign in both those areas.” Stepien said he and House Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) both agreed that Trump should embrace mail-in voting during the 2020 election and encourage his supporters to do likewise, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign manager said he told Trump that focusing on in-person turnout on Election Day risked “leaving a good deal to chance” compared to the mail-in alternative. Trump ignored the advice and instead attacked mail-in votes as fraudulent. In addition to attempting to overturn the results of the election, investigators say Trump used his election fraud lies to reap a financial windfall from aggrieved voters. Senior investigative counselor Amanda Wick said the Trump campaign raised $250 million between Election Day and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack via millions of fundraising emails alleging voter fraud. “The Trump campaign knew these claims of voter fraud were false, yet they continued to barrage small-dollar donors with emails encouraging them to donate to something called ‘The Official Election Defense Fund,’” Wick said. According to the select committee, no such fund existed. Trump allies’ allegations of vast conspiracies in swing states to add to Biden’s vote tally were all, without fail, completely baseless, numerous Justice Department officials told the committee. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Giuliani told state legislators that 8,000 “dead people” had voted for Biden. “Not only was there not evidence of 8,000 dead voters voting in Pennsylvania, there wasn’t evidence of eight,” said Al Schmidt, a Republican former Philadelphia city commissioner. Schmidt noted that he and his family were subjected to disturbing threats after Trump personally named him on Twitter. Rich Donoghue, the former acting deputy U.S. attorney general, also recalled the difficulty of briefing Trump on the specific findings in the states. “Sir, we’ve done dozens of investigations, hundreds of interviews,” he recalled telling Trump. “The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. We’ve looked in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. We’re doing our job. Much of the info you’re getting is false.” “There were so many of these allegations that when you gave him a very direct answer on one of them, he wouldn’t fight us on it, but he would move to another allegation,” Donoghue said. “I told him flat-out that most of the evidence he’s getting is false.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Ohio Governor Signs Bill Allowing Armed School Employees,politics," COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio school districts could begin arming employees as soon as this fall under a bill signed into law Monday by GOP Gov. Mike DeWine. The law, as enacted, requires up to 24 hours of training before an employee can go armed, and up to eight hours of annual training. The training programs must be approved by the Ohio School Safety Center, and DeWine announced he’s ordering the center to require the maximum 24 hours and the maximum eight hours. Schools can provide additional training if they wish, DeWine said. Before announcing the bill signing, the governor outlined several other school safety measures he and lawmakers have promoted, including $100 million for school security upgrades in schools and $5 million for upgrades at colleges. The state is also adding 28 employees to the school safety center to work with districts on safety issues and to provide training under the new law. Ohio has also provided $1.2 billion in wellness funding for schools to address mental health and other issues, the governor said. The new law “is giving schools an option, based on their particular circumstances, to make the best decision they can make with the best information they have,” DeWine said. The governor said his preference remains that school districts hire armed school resource officers, but said the law is another tool for districts that want to protect children. He emphasized that it’s optional, not a requirement. Mayors of Ohio’s biggest cities, including Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland, planned an afternoon news conference to highlight gun violence in their communities and outline their differences with the governor over gun issues. Nan Whaley, DeWine’s Democratic opponent for governor, also planned a news conference, after denouncing his decision to sign the bill. The signing came the same day a new law went into effect making a concealed weapons permit optional for those legally allowed to carry a weapon. Democrats have said the law sends the wrong message coming so soon after the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Republicans say the measure could prevent such shootings. Lawmakers fast-tracked the legislation to counter the impact of a court ruling that said, under current law, armed school workers would need hundreds of hours of training. The measure is opposed by major law enforcement groups, gun control advocates, and the state’s teachers unions. It’s supported by a handful of police departments and school districts.

12,"After Bitter Loss, Ousted Centrist Democrat Goes After Party That Backed Him",politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) got significant support from national Democrats in his campaign against primary challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner. But after losing to McLeod-Skinner in May, Schrader isn’t doing the party any favors. In his first interview since his defeat, Schrader told a local television station that he believes McLeod-Skinner will lose the race for Oregon’s 5th Congressional District in November. “The red wave begins in Oregon – Oregon’s 5th district,” he told KATU on Thursday. “That’s unfortunate.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have both pledged their full support for McLeod-Skinner, but Schrader has yet to officially endorse her. Schrader also revealed in the interview that there is a “significant chance” he will endorse independent centrist Betsy Johnson’s gubernatorial campaign, rather than backing Democratic nominee Tina Kotek, the former speaker of the state’s House of Representatives. “I think people are exhausted with the extreme, far-right Trumpites. I think they’re very concerned about the socialist drift on the Democrat left,” Schrader said. “So that opens up the middle.” Schrader’s remarks come on the heels of a decision to break with the party on gun safety legislation. He was one of two House Democrats to vote against a package of stricter gun regulations that included raising the legal eligibility age for purchase of a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Five Republicans voted for the whole package and 10 Republicans voted for the stand-alone bill to raise the eligibility age for purchasing long guns; Schrader did not vote for the latter, either. Although McLeod-Skinner won by successfully portraying Schrader as an obstacle to President Joe Biden’s agenda, Schrader received Biden’s first endorsement of the midterm election cycle. The DCCC, which is House Democrats’ campaign arm, also assigned staff to help Schrader win the primary. At the same time, Schrader did not benefit from the full force of the Democratic establishment’s incumbent protection infrastructure. Vote Blue PAC, a super PAC founded by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chose not to endorse him. And House Democratic leaders, who intervened on behalf of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) — another embattled conservative Democrat — stayed out of Schrader’s race. Asked for comment about both Schrader’s remarks and the race overall, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chose to ignore Schrader. “Oregon voters have a clear choice this November,” DCCC spokesperson Johanna Warshaw said in a statement. “Jamie McLeod-Skinner is a proven champion for working families – fighting to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs, protect Oregon workers, and defend a woman’s right to choose.” The White House likewise declined to address Schrader, but made clear that it supports McLeod-Skinner. “Of course we support her in the general,” a Biden adviser told HuffPost. “And she is a strong candidate who will fight for Oregon families and work to lower costs.” McLeod-Skinner is due to face Republican nominee Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, in a district that leans Democratic. Biden carried Oregon’s 5th by nine percentage points in 2020, a slightly smaller margin than he enjoyed in the seat’s boundaries before redistricting. The DCCC is already underscoring Chavez-DeRemer’s ties to former President Donald Trump. Chavez-DeRemer met with Trump while serving as mayor in 2018, and this past April, she would not definitively say who she believed won the 2020 presidential election. “Lori Chavez-DeRemer is running on an extreme, far-right agenda that includes passing a near-total ban on abortion for Oregon women,” Warshaw said. “We’re confident that Oregon voters will see the stark difference between McLeod-Skinner and her extremist opponent, and they won’t hesitate to keep this seat blue this November.” Schrader’s refusal to endorse McLeod-Skinner thus far, and his remarks, which effectively undermine her, reinforce progressives’ complaints that top Democrats are quicker to impose party discipline on the left than on centrists who disregard the party more frequently. “It’s embarrassing that Kurt Schrader refuses to support the Democratic nominee in his district, and it’s even more shameful that Dem leaders who are so quick to criticize progressives for a lack of loyalty are willing to let this slide,” said Maya Handa, a progressive campaign strategist who most recently managed Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam’s congressional campaign. Eric Koch, who advises a mix of mainstream and more progressive Democratic candidates, agreed. “Schrader should support the Democrat in the race for Oregon’s 5th District and for governor,” he said. “He lost the primary and now needs to get behind the Democrats who will be on the ballot in November in Oregon ― too much is at stake.” Schrader’s salty response to his defeat in the primary is not unprecedented. Former Rep. Brad Ashford, a conservative Nebraska Democrat, endorsed the Republican incumbent, Rep. Don Bacon, in 2020 after his wife, Ann, lost to progressive Kara Eastman in the Democratic primary for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Eastman went on to lose to Bacon in the general election, despite Biden’s victory among the district’s voters. But McLeod-Skinner, who has already prevailed against an incumbent with far greater funding, is in a better position than Eastman and other progressive candidates who have run in swing seats. In the KATU interview, Schrader blamed the addition of more liberal areas in the new district for his primary defeat, as well as the overall drift of the Democratic electorate to the left. “The Democratic Party has moved quite a bit to the left — moving out from underneath me. Times move on,” Schrader said. “The socialist wing of the party is taking over and that’s their opportunity to elect somebody different.” But while McLeod-Skinner supports “Medicare for All” and had the support of left-wing groups like the Working Families Party, she ran on a mainstream platform of rejecting corporate PAC money, fighting to lower prescription drug prices and being a better partner for Biden. She also picked up the support of several influential labor unions and four of the district’s county Democratic parties ― an unusual feat for a primary challenger. Rather than punishing Schrader for not being sufficiently socialist, Democratic voters in Oregon’s closed primary system appeared to reject Schrader’s effort to water down Democrats’ bill empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and his simultaneous reliance on pharmaceutical industry donations. Republicans had also already seized on a report in the Intercept suggesting that Schrader might not actually live on the farm he owns in the district. And at least one Republican strategist in Oregon, Rebecca Tweed, thought McLeod-Skinner would be a more formidable contender than Schrader for Democrats. “If it’s McLeod-Skinner and [Chavez-DeRemer], I think that’s a huge matchup,” she said in a TV news discussion before the race was officially called. “Both sides will need to be concerned about how competitive that gets.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Terrifying New Videos Show Capitol Rioters Breaching Police Line And Making Threats,politics," Social Justice Reporter Senior Reporter, HuffPost As the nation continues to learn more about the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, footage obtained by HuffPost reveals new details about how rioters broke through a police line that day as well as about the threats of lethal violence coming from the mob of Donald Trump supporters. One set of videos shows Nolan Cooke, 24, breaching the Capitol as he wore a camera around his neck and recorded video while shouting obscenities at officers protecting the building. Cooke was sentenced to one year and one day in prison Friday on felony charges for breaking into the Capitol and disrupting a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden’s Electoral College win. The sentence comes the day after the House select committee’s first public hearing on the insurrection. In Cooke’s recordings, he is seen wearing a blue jean jacket and black gloves as he hoists an American flag toward the sky while surrounded by hundreds of other Trump supporters. While standing in front of a barricade, Cooke tells someone, “Hey, let’s walk around a little bit.” In another recording, Cooke stands behind a person in a black “Sons of Trump” sweatshirt. A person talking to the crowd in the background near Cooke asks them, “Are you all here?” to which Cooke immediately shouts back, “Yeah!” An additional recording that Cooke posted on his Snapchat account records him shouting, “Move the gates!” repeatedly, then saying, “This is our fucking land!” as he pushes to lead the crowd forward. While U.S. Capitol Police officers stand in front of him, Cooke opens the barricades up again, saying, “This is our land!” He fights back with the officers as they attempt to block the crowd. “We’re taking this motherfucker. We’re fucking taking it,” Cooke shouts as police are attacked. After the struggle briefly ends, Cooke holds up his middle finger toward the officers on the Capitol grounds. People in the background are heard repeatedly shouting, “Stop the steal!” as the crowd continues pushing forward against the U.S. Capitol police officers. Video from Cooke’s TikTok account also shows him approaching U.S. Capitol Police officers with U.S. and Donald Trump flags waving in front of him. Cooke joined the frontlines of the riot and aided in leading the charge, breaking through a police line, according to court documents. Cooke was placed on three years of supervised release and must also pay $2,000 in restitution, according to the Department of Justice. HuffPost also obtained videos in another case, related to a sentencing hearing for Daryl and Daniel Johnson, a father-son duo from Iowa convicted of felony civil disorder for their role in the riot. Daryl, the father, was sentenced to one month in prison, and Daniel was sentenced to four months. The footage was taken on the other side of doors inside the Capitol, where a throng of Trump supporters can be seen trying to get into the Rotunda. “Get out of the way!” the rioters inside can be heard yelling at the cops, eager to join forces with their MAGA brethren outside. “Open the door!” they yelled. “Push!” One rioter repeatedly yells “Your life is not worth it!” at the officers, adding: “You’re going to die if you don’t get out of the way.” The rioters charge the visibly panicked police officers, pressing them against the door and using Trump and Gadsen “Don’t tread on me” flags to try to pry the door open. “You guys, if it works, run,” someone says. Eventually the doors open and more rioters begin to spill into the Rotunda. A police officer can be seen staggering away, holding his head. “Mark my words, yesterday will be the beginning of the revolution,” Daryl Johnson wrote on social media the day after the riot, according to prosecutors. He also suggested there could be “hangings on the front lawn of the capital.” Social Justice Reporter Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,William Barr Says Trump Grew 'Detached From Reality' After Losing Election,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump became “detached from reality” in the weeks after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, to the point where he refused to hear from even his closest advisers that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to his former U.S. attorney general, William Barr. “There was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were,” Barr said in new video testimony aired during Monday’s hearing of the Jan. 6 committee. “My opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud,” he said. “And I haven’t seen anything since the election that changes my mind on that.” Barr’s deposition to the committee was a central piece of Monday’s hearing, which was focused on proving that Trump and his advisers knew he had lost the election to Biden, but that, despite that, Trump “engaged in a massive effort to spread false and fraudulent information to convince huge portions of the U.S. population that fraud had stolen the election from him.” In his pre-recorded testimony, Barr recalled that Trump was “as mad as I’ve ever seen him” in early December 2020, when the then-U.S. attorney general told The Associated Press that he saw no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Barr said he had a previously scheduled meeting with the president a few hours after he gave that interview. When he arrived, Trump was so angry that he talked about himself in the third-person. “He said, ‘This is killing me. You didn’t have to say this,’” Barr said Trump yelled at him. “‘You must have said this because you hate Trump. You hate Trump.’” Barr said he repeatedly told the president his claims of widespread voter fraud were “bullshit,” and that he wasted a month making “idiotic claims” about Dominion Voting Services, a voting machine company, leading to massive fraud. “It was like playing whack-a-mole,” Barr said, with all the “bogus and silly” claims of election fraud. “I told him it was crazy stuff.” Barr said there was a big shift in Trump’s state of mind before and after he lost election. “Before the election, it was possible to talk sense into the president,” he said. “While you sometimes had to engage in a big wrestling match with him, it was possible to keep things on track. But I felt that after the election, he didn’t seem to be listening.” Barr resigned on Dec. 14, 2020. Of course, Trump had been pushing lies about the likelihood of voter fraud well before the November 2020 election. For months, he had been laying the groundwork for rejecting the election results if he lost. And his efforts were all in plain view. Many of the same former Trump administration officials now saying they pushed back on Trump’s lies, like Barr, were publicly silent as the president and other top Republicans like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) went on national television to fuel lies about the election being stolen. Barr himself helped to sow doubts about the reliability of the 2020 election results. In September 2020, he falsely claimed on CNN that elections that have been held with mail-in ballots have resulted in “substantial fraud and coercion.” He went on to falsely claim that the Justice Department indicted someone in Texas for illegally tampering with 1,700 ballots. Both of his claims were wildly untrue and debunked by The Washington Post. And for all the pushback that the former U.S. attorney general now says he engaged in with Trump over his delusions about the election, he lavished Trump with nothing but praise and gratitude in his resignation letter. “I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the Department’s review of voter fraud allegations in the 2020 elections and how these allegations will continue to be pursued,” reads the first sentence of Barr’s resignation letter to Trump.

15,Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman Testifies In Court Against Jan. 6 Rioter,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman testified in court on Monday in a trial of a Delaware man accused of storming the U.S. Capitol with a Confederate flag on Jan. 6, 2021. Kevin Seefried and his son, Hunter, are charged with obstruction of an official proceeding and disorderly conduct over their participation in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. They were among a group of rioters who first broke into the building and charged up a set of stairs near the Senate entrance, resisting Goodman’s orders to stop advancing. Seefried “used the base of a flag pole in jabbing motion to create space between him and I,” Goodman said Monday, according to Lawfare editor Roger Parloff. The defendant was angry and demanded to know where members of Congress were hiding, the officer added. Goodman’s quick thinking was credited with leading the men away from the doors to the chamber, which held nearly every U.S. senator. The incredible moment was captured on video by a HuffPost reporter. The officer later was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal Both Seefried and his son have pleaded not guilty. They’ve waived their right to jury trial and U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden will instead try their case. Seefried told the FBI that he threatened Goodman, saying: “And then I threw my stick down. I said, ‘You can shoot me, man, but we’re comin’ in.’” The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has begun holding its first public hearings, with more testimony from former Trump administration officials expected this week. Caroline Edwards, the first U.S. Capitol Police officer injured in the attack, described the “carnage,” “chaos” and “absolute war zone” outside the building during the committee’s first prime-time hearing last week. ″[Officers] were bleeding, they were throwing up. ...

16,Trump Listened To A Drunk Rudy Giuliani Before Declaring Victory On Election Night,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump listened to drunken advice from Rudy Giuliani instead of his professional campaign advisers, a former Trump campaign adviser testified before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Giuliani was “definitely intoxicated” on election night when he told campaign aides that Trump should falsely declare victory, former Trump adviser Jason Miller said in a video deposition the committee revealed on Monday. “The mayor was definitely intoxicated but I do not know his level of intoxication when he spoke with the president,” Miller said in his video deposition in response to a question from committee staffers. “Mayor Giuliani was saying, ‘We won it. They’re stealing it from us. Where did the votes come from? We need to go say that we won’ and essentially anyone who didn’t agree with this position was being weak,” Miller said. Monday’s hearing, the committee’s second public presentation of its evidence, focused on Trump’s lie that he actually won the 2020 election as part of a broader conspiracy to overturn the results. The effort culminated in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, where marauding Trump supporters tried to intimidate members of Congress into throwing out the Electoral College result. The committee also played video clips of its prior interviews with Giuliani and Trump campaign staffer Bill Stepien, who also testified that Giuliani said on Election Day that Trump should declare victory even though ballots were still being counted. Miller and Stepien said they told the president it was too early to declare victory, but that Trump disagreed. “It was far too early to be making any calls like that,” Stepien said. “Ballots were still being counted. It was far too early to be making any proclamation like that.” Several other people close to the president, such as former Attorney General Bill Barr, said in video testimony to the committee that they told the president in the weeks after the election there had been no widespread fraud. Former acting Deputy Attorney General Rich Donoghue testified that the Justice Department thoroughly investigated dozens of potential fraud cases, but that they were all unfounded. “There were so many of the allegations that when you gave him the very direct answer on one of them, he wouldn’t fight us on it, but he would move to another allegation,” Donoghue said. Summarizing the testimony, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said, “President Trump rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night and instead followed the course recommended by an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani to just claim he won and insist that the vote counting stop to falsely claim everything was fraudulent.” Giuliani denied through an attorney on Monday that he was drunk on election night, according to CNN. In his interview with the committee, Giuliani said, “I spoke to the president several times that night.” Interviewers apparently did not ask Giuliani if he had been drinking on election night; he has said he enjoys Scotch whisky but has denied being an alcoholic. The committee then played a clip of Trump that night calling the election a “fraud” and saying, “Frankly, we did win this election.” After the hearing, HuffPost asked committee member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) why it matters that Giuliani was inebriated on election night. “To me, it doesn’t make much difference,” Raskin said. “It’s just a fact that obviously came out during the questioning, but it does further erode whatever credibility you might have placed in his judgment.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,"Trump Knew His Election Fraud Claims Were A Big Lie, Trump's Own Aides Said",politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Donald Trump knew his “big lie” that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from him was, in fact, a big lie, according to testimony the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol laid out at the public hearing Monday morning. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat handling much of Monday’s questioning of witnesses, said the testimony of Trump’s own aides was clear. “On election night, he claimed even before the votes were counted that his loss was because of fraud,” she said. “Mr. Trump’s election fraud claims were false. Mr. Trump’s closest advisers knew it. Mr. Trump knew it.” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who had been scheduled to testify in person Monday, withdrew at the last minute when his wife went into labor and Stepien went to join her. In a video clip of Stepien’s taped deposition, Stepien said he and other top campaign aides recommended that Trump say that “votes were still being counted, that it was too early to tell, it was too early to call the race.” But Trump refused to accept that advice, he told investigators. “He thought I was wrong,” Stepien said. “He told me so ― that he was going to go in a different direction.” Among the witnesses appearing in person was Chris Stirewalt, the Fox News journalist who was pushed out of his job after his team correctly called Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. Stirewalt said Trump’s chance of winning the presidency was “none” after election night was over and votes continued to come in favoring Biden. “Remember, he needed three of these states to change. And in order to do that ― you’re better off to play the Powerball,” he said. The most compelling witness, though, was likely one who did not appear in person, but whose video testimony devastatingly took apart Trump’s claims of fraud and a stolen election. Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr, called the fraud claims being pushed by his campaign “bogus and silly.” He called the allegations of rigged voting machines “idiotic.” He likened having to knock down one conspiracy theory after another to a game of “whack-a-mole.” He mocked the movie recently pushed by Trump and his allies, “2000 Mules,” as failing to prove any of its fraud claims. Barr also pointed out that Trump did better in Detroit ― supposedly a hotbed of voter fraud ― in 2020 than he did in 2016, and that Trump did worse on the ballot in Pennsylvania than a pair of statewide Republicans, and worse than the state’s congressional candidates. “Generally he was a weak element on the Republican ticket,” Barr said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked committee membership to Republicans who helped spread Trump’s lies and are potentially witnesses in the Jan. 6 investigations, so Monday’s hearing moved somberly and methodically through the evidence. The bipartisan panel moved through clips from video depositions of officials from Trump administration and the Trump campaign calmly stating that there was no fraud in the 2020 election. The committee showed just one brief scene of violence from the attack on the Capitol, designed to intimidate then-Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers into declaring Trump the winner notwithstanding the election results, in stark contrast to the committee’s first public hearing on Thursday, when it made heavy use of new footage of that day. The only moment of levity came during video statements from top Trump aides describing fellow adviser Rudy Giuliani as “drunk” and “intoxicated” on election night as he advised Trump to simply go ahead and declare victory. The testimony drew a few chuckles from the Cannon building audience. Lofgren also described evidence of how Trump, his campaign, his newly created “Save America” political committee and the Republican National Committee together raised about $250 million spreading Trump’s election lies between Election Day and Jan. 6. from small-dollar donors. “The big lie was also a big ripoff,” she said. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. He spurred on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot — a last-ditch attempt to remain in office — which killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024. In statements on his personal social media platform, Trump has continued to lie about the election and the Jan. 6 committee’s work, calling it a “hoax” similar to previous investigations into his 2016 campaign’s acceptance of Russian assistance and his attempted extortion of Ukraine into helping his 2020 campaign.

Instead of a live appearance, the committee showed footage of Stepien’s previous testimony during the hearing. “As you know Mr. Stepien has appeared previously, and so we’ll be able to provide the American people with a lot of interesting, new, and important information that Mr. Stepien’s provided to us previously,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee’s vice-chair, told CNN’s Manu Raju ahead of the hearing. Asked Liz Cheney about Stepien not appearing today, and she told me: “As you know Mr Stepien has appeared previously, and so we’ll be able to provide the American people with a lot of interesting, new, and important information that Mr. Stepien’s provided to us previously” Monday’s hearing illustrated the lengths to which Trump went to claim the election was stolen even though he knew this was false. Stepien was subpoeaned by the House panel in November 2021 along with other Trump officials, including Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The committee said Stepien “supervised the conversion of the Trump presidential campaign to an effort focused on ‘Stop the Steal’ messaging and related fundraising.” “That messaging included the promotion of certain false claims related to voting machines despite an internal campaign memo in which campaign staff determined that such claims were false,” the House panel continued. The committee aired clips of Stepien’s taped deposition in which he said he and other campaign aides told Trump he said say it was too early to call the race rather than declaring victory, but that the then-president ignored their advice. “He thought I was wrong,” Stepien said in the deposition. “He told me so ― that he was going to go in a different direction.” During Thursday’s hearing, the committee aired part of Miller’s testimony acknowledging Trump’s campaign staff told the former president he lost the 2020 president election. Miller detailed an incident where Matt Oczkowski, Trump’s campaign internal data expert, held a call with Trump in the days following the election, telling Trump he had lost, based on the reported results. “I remember he delivered to the president pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose,” Miller told the committee. Stepien currently works as an advisor to Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Cheney in Wyoming. He was scheduled to testify at Monday’s hearing along with Ben Ginsberg, a Republican attorney who is considered an expert on elections, and Chris Stirewalt, a former Fox News political editor. All major news networks, including Fox News this time, aired the hearing live. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Peter Hegseth Makes Infuriating Comment On Hate Group's Arrest Near Pride Parade,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News host Peter Hegseth responded Sunday to a hate group allegedly planning a riot at a gay pride parade by disparaging Black Lives Matter protesters. (Watch the video below.) A report on “Fox & Friends Weekend” noted that 31 members of the white supremacist group Patriot Front crammed into a U-Haul to carry out the plot. They were arrested near the pride event in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. “Police say they learned about the U-Haul from a tipster who reported the men loading into the truck in the parking lot of a hotel,” Fox News anchor Ashley Strohmier said. Hegseth then brought up Black Lives Matter protests, which are entirely unrelated. “I just want to know how many BLM riots were prevented because we got in on the inside, before they rioted and burned down cities,” Hegseth responded. “Very interesting,” cohost Rachel Campos-Duffy replied. “Never ahead of that curve,” Hegseth followed. A study of thousands of Black Lives Matters protests after the police killing of George Floyd found an overwhelming majority to be nonviolent. The small percentage that turned violent involved violent intervention by law enforcement or counterprotesting from extremist groups, researchers found. In a similar vein, conservative media and politicians have made misguided attempts to draw parallels between the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and Black Lives Matter protests. h/t Media Matters General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,Dad Who Carried Confederate Flag Into Capitol Heads To Trial,politics," A federal judge’s acquittal of a New Mexico man in April was a rare blemish on the Justice Department’s record of securing convictions in U.S. Capitol riot cases. More than two months later, a Delaware father and son hope the same judge will clear them, too. Widely published photographs showed Kevin Seefried carrying a Confederate battle flag inside the Capitol after he entered the building with his son, Hunter. The Seefrieds were “early, aggressive and active participants” in the Capitol breach and among the first rioters to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, prosecutors have said. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden will hear testimony without a jury for the Seefrieds’ bench trial, which is scheduled to start Monday. They waived their right to a jury trial, which means McFadden will decide their cases. McFadden, whom President Donald Trump nominated in 2017, has criticized prosecutors’ handling of Capitol riot cases. He suggested that the Justice Department has been unjustly tougher on Capitol riot defendants compared with people arrested at protests against police brutality and racial injustice after George Floyd’s 2020 murder by a Minneapolis police officer. McFadden also has criticized prosecutors for seeking jail time for some nonviolent Capitol riot defendants but not for left-wing activists who protested Trump’s nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, The Washington Post reported. In April, McFadden acquitted New Mexico resident Matthew Martin of misdemeanor charges that he illegally entered the Capitol and engaged in disorderly conduct after he walked into the building. Martin testified that a police officer waved him into the building. A prosecutor rejected that testimony as “nonsense,” but McFadden said it was reasonable for Martin to believe that outnumbered police officers allowed him to enter the Capitol through the Rotunda doors. In March, McFadden acquitted a New Mexico elected official of engaging in disorderly conduct but convicted him of illegally entering restricted Capitol grounds. The judge said there was ample evidence that Otero County Commissioner Couy Griffin knew he was in a restricted area and didn’t leave. However, McFadden concluded prosecutors didn’t meet their burden to prove that Griffin engaged in disorderly conduct. McFadden is the only judge to a hold a bench trial for a Capitol riot case so far. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly is scheduled to preside over a bench trial for Jesus Rivera, a Pensacola, Florida, man charged with four riot-related misdemeanors. President Bill Clinton nominated Kollar-Kotelly to the court in 1997. At least four other Capitol riot defendants have bench trials scheduled for this year. Juries have unanimously convicted five Capitol riot defendants of all charges, a perfect record for prosecutors so far. More than 300 others have pleaded guilty to riot offenses, mostly misdemeanors punishable by no more than one year in prison. Approximately 100 others have trial dates in 2022 or 2023. More than 800 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack. The Seefrieds traveled to Washington from their home in Laurel, Delaware, to hear Trump’s speech at the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6. After the rally, they stopped by their car before joining the mob that stormed the Capitol, prosecutors say. The Seefrieds climbed over a wall near a stairwell and scaffolding in the northwest section of the Capitol and were among the first rioters to approach the building near the Senate Wing Door, according to prosecutors. After watching other rioters use a police shield and a wood plank to break a window, Hunter Seefried used a gloved fist to clear a shard of glass in one of the broken windowpanes, prosecutors said. “The defendants and scores of other rioters entered the Capitol building through that window,” prosecutors wrote. The Seefrieds joined other rioters in confronting Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman and in looking for members of Congress and the location where they would be counting the Electoral College votes for the 2020 presidential election, according to prosecutors. Goodman, who is expected to testify at the Seefrieds’ trial, has been hailed as a hero for leading a group of rioters away from Senate chamber and up a set of stairs to an area where other officers were waiting. Goodman also directed Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to turn around and head away from the mob. Kevin Seefried told the FBI that he threatened Goodman with violence, saying: “And then I threw my stick down. I said, ‘You can shoot me, man, but we’re comin’ in,’” according to prosecutors. Kevin Seefried carried a Confederate battle flag from home and was photographed displaying it on a large flagpole as he walked through the Capitol. “Indeed, the flag that Kevin Seefried carried itself served to signal his intent: the Confederate Battle Flag, a symbol of violent opposition to the United States government,” prosecutors wrote. The charges against both Kevin and Hunter Seefried include a felony count of obstruction of an official proceeding, the joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden’s electoral victory. Hunter Seefried told the FBI that he went to Washington because he was concerned about “fraud” tied to the election, prosecutors said. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,"Prominent GOP Gov. Says Trump 'Politically, Morally Responsible' For Jan. 6",politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, placed heavy blame Sunday on former President Donald Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. (Watch the video below.) Trump “is politically, morally responsible for much of what has happened,” Hutchinson told Bret Baier on “Fox News Sunday.” However, the outgoing state leader said the House select panel investigating the siege had yet to prove more regarding Trump’s role. “In terms of criminal liability, I think the committee has a long way to go before they could establish that,” added Hutchinson, who is in the final year of office due to term limits. Trump loyalist and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the GOP candidate to replace him. The panel’s public hearings on the insurrection to overturn the 2020 election results were set to continue Monday, aiming to prove Trump’s guilt. Hutchinson said establishing a criminal link was a “heavy lift.” But panel members said Sunday they have enough evidence to generate a criminal indictment against the twice-impeached former president. Hutchinson called Jan. 6 a “costly error” that was “wrong for our country” and “wrong to push in that direction.” “I think Republicans need to do a lot of soul searching as to what is the right thing here and what is the right thing to say for our party, for our democracy and for our future and not simply appeal to the basest instincts of some of our base,” he said.

12,These Are The Races Where Democrats Are Rooting For Election Deniers,politics," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democrats are attempting to steer the course of Republican primaries at an unprecedented level ahead of November’s midterm elections, spending millions of dollars to promote GOP candidates they view as weak ― even if those candidates embrace the very lies about the 2020 election that the party calls an existential threat to democracy. National Democratic groups and leading Democratic candidates have spent millions of dollars in Colorado, Illinois, Nevada and Pennsylvania to promote Republicans who both parties believe will struggle to win, even in a political environment shaped by high inflation and low approval ratings for President Joe Biden. Working to influence the other party’s primaries has become common for Democrats and Republicans alike, in the years since former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) famously promoted the late far-right Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) so she could face him in her 2012 Senate bid. But the scale and spending of current Democratic efforts ― public spending now tops $10 million ― have little precedent. Picking their opponent has paid off in the past for Democrats. They have their bare-minimum Senate majority in part because they worked to get an easier opponent for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in 2018. But the growing authoritarian bent of the GOP, the willingness of conservative candidates to embrace former President Donald Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, and the Republican-leaning political environment all make such maneuvering a trickier proposition. Democratic operatives have generally defended their efforts to shape Republican primaries as a bare-knuckle but necessary tactic to survive in a challenging political environment, noting ads that promote a candidate to GOP primary voters can also serve as effective attacks for a general election audience. But pundits both on the left and among “Never Trump” conservatives have criticized the strategy as risky, and reminiscent of the party’s hopes in 2016 that Trump himself, a supposedly “unelectable” candidate, would secure the GOP presidential nomination. “In an environment like this, you want to go against a candidate that gives you the best chance to win. But there are no guarantees in this business,” said Mike Mikus, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. “But sometimes you have to push the crazy person over the top, and play the odds.” In Pennsylvania, Mikus has pronounced himself “schizophrenic” over the victory of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano in the GOP gubernatorial primary last month. Mastriano, who attended the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington, D.C., and has fully embraced Trump’s election lies, is widely seen as unelectable. But $5 gas could turn the politically impossible into a plausible outcome. “For Mastriano to win, it would have to be an absolute disaster we’ve never seen anything like. But the environment’s bad, and it could get worse,” Mikus said. The latest example of this kind of Democratic gamble is in Colorado, where a freshly formed group, Democratic Colorado, has started running ads attacking state Rep. Ron Hanks (R) as “too conservative.” The ads are a clear attempt to raise GOP voters’ awareness and opinion of Hanks, who attended the Jan. 6 rally outside the U.S. Capitol and has raised only paltry sums for his campaign. “He says Joe Biden’s election was a fraud. Hanks wants to ban all abortions, and he wants to build Trump’s border wall,” a narrator says in the 30-second ad, which began airing Wednesday. #COSen: D group Democratic Colorado is up on TV with this spot calling R candidate Ron Hanks ""too conservative for Colorado""#Meddling pic.twitter.com/jodJok2l3O Hanks’ dedication to election denial is real: The opening ad of his campaign showed him blowing up a Dominion voting machine. He’s also admitted to crossing police barricades during the insurrection – although he also claimed the event was a false flag operation, with Black Lives Matter and antifa activists breaching the Capitol. That’s led some Colorado Democrats to question the strategy behind the spots. “It is harmful to democracy,” Dan Grossman, a former Colorado state legislator, wrote on Twitter. “Americans who value the rule of law, regardless of party and partisan advantage, should ensure that seditionists like Hanks never see the ballot as a major party nominee.” The timing of the ad’s debut was not a coincidence. Wednesday was the first day a group could begin airing ads without having to reveal its donors before Hanks faces Joe O’Dea, a comparatively moderate businessman, in the June 28 Republican primary. Unlike Hanks, O’Dea has recognized Biden as the legitimate victor of the 2020 election. Neither candidate is particularly well known, and the winner will face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in November. In the past, Senate Majority PAC ― a super PAC controlled by allies of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ― has funded pop-up groups like Democratic Colorado to try and influence GOP primaries. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is barred from directly coordinating with super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited amounts, seemed to request ads highlighting Hanks’ conservatism and bashing O’Dea for supporting Democrats in the past with a post on a public website. O’Dea’s campaign said the interference is proof he’s a real threat to Bennet in blue-tinted Colorado, and released internal polling showing him with a healthy lead over Hanks before the Democratic Colorado’s ads began. “[Democrats] are gonna try to steal this election, because they don’t want to spend the money they’re going to have to spend against me this fall,” O’Dea said in a radio interview Thursday. “I’m a real candidate.” So far, however, the Democratic Governors Association has been the most proactive in GOP primaries, taking steps to shape contests in Illinois, Colorado and Nevada. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the party’s nominee for governor in the Keystone State, also ran ads aiming to ensure he’d face Mastriano in the general election. Mastriano, who would have the power to appoint Pennsylvania’s top elections official if he wins the governorship, won with the former president’s endorsement. He’s suggested he would decline to certify the 2024 election unless a Republican wins. Shapiro’s ads, which similarly attacked Mastriano as a far-right conservative, were likely not the determining factor in his victory. He consistently led in polling, news outlets regularly covered his history of extreme views, and Pennsylvania’s other major GOP candidates for governor similarly endorsed Trump’s lies about the election. “It’s not our fault Republican voters in Pennsylvania wanted this,” a Democratic operative who worked on the race said, providing a link to a story about Mastriano’s long history of comparing events to the Holocaust. Trump’s election denialism holds considerable power over many GOP candidates and voters, and it’s led some Democrats to conclude the threat to democracy would be the same no matter which candidate makes it to a general election. “Sometimes in campaigns the difference between the ‘moderate’ and the ‘extreme’ candidate is just in the rhetoric, and really their policy positions ― or willingness to disregard the will of the people ― are pretty much the same,” said Adam Bozzi, the communications director for the liberal group End Citizens United. “A radical disguised as a moderate can be very dangerous for democracy.” In its various efforts to shape GOP primaries, the Democratic Governors Association has tried to shrink the chances of the GOP establishment’s preferred candidates ― Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo in Nevada, University of Colorado Regent Heidi Ganahl and Illinois state Sen. Richard Irvin. Still, Democrats don’t have to go back far to see the potential risks of their strategy. In 2020, national Democrats spent millions trying to boost former Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Trump acolyte and anti-immigration zealot, believing he would give their Senate candidate, state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a chance to win in a typically red state. The campaign failed, with Republicans nominating Rep. Roger Marshall instead. Marshall went on to defeat Bollier in the Senate race by almost 12 percentage points ― a margin indicating Kobach almost certainly would have won the general as well.

13,The Anti-Abortion Movement Has A Horrifically Violent Side — And Many Are Bracing For What Comes Next,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks, it will mark the culmination of a decades-long, multimillion-dollar legal effort by the American conservative movement to end abortion rights and force many pregnant people to give birth. It will also be the culmination of a multi-decade terror campaign. From 1977 to 2020 in America, anti-abortion activists committed at least 11 murders, 26 attempted murders, 956 threats of harm or death, 624 stalking incidents and four kidnappings, according to data collected by the National Abortion Federation. They have bombed 42 abortion clinics, set 194 on fire, attempted to bomb or burn an additional 104 and made 667 bomb threats. To be an abortion provider in the U.S. has meant going to work every morning under the threat of violence. And as Roe stands on the brink, some family members of people lost to this horrific violence are reliving their worst days. A recent leaked draft suggests that in all likelihood the abortion care their loved ones died practicing will soon disappear across much of the country. Republicans and the wider anti-abortion movement have often condemned this terror but other times have signaled their tacit, or even explicit, support for it. According to David Cohen, author of “Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism,” the GOP has worked in “conjunction” with extreme anti-abortion activists for decades. “They can let the extremists engage in violence, harassment and threats to accomplish the same goal that the mainstream movement tries to accomplish through legislation and other policy changes,” Cohen said. The GOP has sometimes flaunted its ties to its militant anti-abortion brethren, like when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) formed a “Pro-Lifers for Cruz” coalition as part of his presidential campaign in 2016 and named Troy Newman as a national co-chair. Newman is the president of a radical anti-abortion group and the author of “Their Blood Cries Out,” a book that crafts a Christian justification for killing abortion providers. The book compared one specific abortion provider, Dr. George Tiller, to Adolf Hitler. Tiller was gunned down in 2009 by a man who owned a copy of “Their Blood Cries Out” and who had the phone number of Newman’s organization, Operation Rescue, on a Post-it note in his car. (Confronted with Newman’s history of extremism, Cruz doubled down on his involvement in the campaign.) Tiller, Cohen noted to HuffPost, was also a frequent target of Fox News. Former host Bill O’Reilly regularly called the doctor a murderer during his prime-time show, once saying he was “operating a death mill.” “It’s not a shock that someone sort of took that messaging to heart to try and stop George Tiller,” Cohen said, “because, after all, if you thought a mass murderer of children was living in your neighborhood, you would want to do things to stop that person. So to have someone on national news, on a regular basis, focusing a spotlight on George Tiller — Bill O’Reilly was complicit in his murder.” Major conservative figures and politicians have repeatedly deployed extreme rhetoric about abortion or have lent credence to dangerous disinformation campaigns. In 2015, for example, Republicans promoted — and fundraised off — deceptively edited videos claiming to show Planned Parenthood officials selling “baby parts.” In December of that year, an anti-abortion extremist allegedly said “no more baby parts” while murdering three people at a clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. But what is the future of anti-abortion violence now that Roe v. Wade appears to be set to be overturned? Cohen isn’t quite sure. On one hand, the decision could embolden anti-abortion extremists, who will feel validated by the Supreme Court opinion and who then might focus their attention on clinics in the 24 states where abortions will still be legal and accessible — at least until Republicans can consolidate enough power in Washington to pass a blanket national abortion ban. But on the other hand, Cohen said, violence is often committed by extremists when they are “frustrated that they’re not getting what they want through normal means, so they resort to extralegal means. So if the Supreme Court does what we think it’s going to do, there may be a period where they feel like, you know what, we won, and we’re winning, so we don’t need to resort to violence to get what we want.” In the meantime, Cohen is concerned about what he sees as an emerging “both sides-ism” in the discourse around abortion rights. After Politico obtained an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito in early May — a “full-throated, unflinching repudiation of the 1973 decision which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights,” the news site wrote — some abortion rights activists have resorted to radical measures. A group called Jane’s Revenge has claimed credit for two arson attacks on the offices of conservative anti-abortion organizations. “If abortions aren’t safe, then you aren’t either,” read graffiti on the office of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison. “Jane was here,” read graffiti on an anti-abortion center in Buffalo, New York. (No one was harmed in either attack.) Authorities also arrested an armed California man this week near the home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The man allegedly wanted to kill Kavanaugh over his expected vote to overturn Roe. “I think we’re going to start seeing the anti-abortion side and conservatives say ‘Well, look, pro-choice people are just as violent and just as extreme as anti-abortion extremists.’ And that’s just not true,” Cohen said. “You know, obviously, if we talk in five years and there’s been 11 murders of anti-abortion, politicians or activists or something, then we’d be close to being the same thing, but right now it’s not the same thing. Like we have a couple of freak people who’ve done some bad things, as opposed to the decades-long, extremist movement to target, harass, sometimes violently, abortion providers and those who work with them. The two are not the same thing. They should not be equated.” As the anti-abortion movement nears a monumental victory, it bears repeating that violence has been an inextricable part of that movement. No one knows this more intimately than those who have lost loved ones to that violence and who are now bracing themselves to live in a post-Roe world — the very world their loved ones’ murderers dreamed would one day exist. Dr. David Gunn was the first U.S. abortion provider to be assassinated. On March 10, 1993, an anti-abortion protester named Michael F. Griffin shot Gunn three times at point-blank range outside a clinic in Pensacola, Florida. Griffin immediately turned himself over to police officers who were at the clinic to watch over a “pro-life” protest. “I’ve just shot Dr. Gunn,” he said. (A witness told The Washington Post that protesters at the clinic responded warmly to the murder. “It looked like they were just happy,” the witness said.) Nearly 30 years later, Gunn’s son, David Gunn Jr., is steeling himself for Roe to be overturned. “It’s disheartening for a whole host of reasons, you know, one, because of the sacrifice my dad made, and all the effort he put into making sure that people have access to abortion in the Deep South for years, and to think that, you know, any day now, that that could be taken away from everybody in my region anyway,” he told HuffPost over the phone from his home in Birmingham, Alabama. “It’s just tragic.” Gunn Jr. was 22 years old when his dad was murdered. In the preceding year, he’d watched his father endure frequent threats and harassment as he traveled across the Bible Belt to provide abortions and other health care to people in Alabama, Georgia and the Florida panhandle, driving more than a thousand miles each week. Sometimes he took alternative routes, on lonely country roads, for fear he was being followed. In a 2017 letter to the Florida parole board arguing that Griffin should not be released from prison, Gunn Jr. recalled his father standing up to the people who had targeted him and his family: On January 22, 1993, roughly two months before his assassination, Dad pulled into work confronted by another angry mob. Today, he must have thought, I am going to protest back. Dad greeted protesters outside a clinic in Montgomery with an impromptu solo performance of Happy Birthday to You celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade. Next, he produced a large boom box, adjusted the volume to 11, and played Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” in their direction while he sang along. His protest generated some local press, his ongoing dedication to women’s health began to draw national attention, and the ire and desperation of his foes intensified. In the months after his father died, Gunn Jr. remembered conservatives condemning the murder but all the words feeling “empty, hollow, and insincere.” Where were their condemnations, after all, when abortion protesters put up “Wanted” posters with his dad’s face and daily schedule on them? Where were their condemnations when abortion protesters turned up outside the school where his younger sister was a student? “When they start taking an actual stance against what their constituents are doing … then I think I can take ’em sincere,” Gunn Jr. said. Moreover, right-wing voices used extreme rhetoric all the time to dehumanize people like his dad. “You can’t… consistently say that one subsection of the medical community are essentially in league with the devil,” Gunn Jr. said, “call them evil, vile baby-killing people, and not expect something tragic to happen. You know, it’s yelling ‘Fire!’ in a theater.” If his dad were still alive to see Roe v. Wade overturned, Gunn Jr. said, he’d mostly be worried about his patients — especially poorer patients — who wouldn’t be able to get health care. “The people who need care the most, as happens so often in our country, are going to be the ones who suffer and can’t get it, while the people who can afford it are going to be able to afford it,” Gunn Jr. said. “It just goes to show,” he added, “that this really never was an argument about life or babies. It’s always been an argument of control. Because if they sincerely cared about life and babies, they wouldn’t want to force motherhood on people who aren’t economically or emotionally — or whatever reason, for that matter, it doesn’t really matter — weren’t ready to have a child.” Gunn Jr. said he doesn’t have a ton of hope at the moment but knows he needs to follow his dad’s example and keep going. “I hoped that by telling his story over and over again, that it would create enough public attention and outcry over it that other people wouldn’t have to deal with it again, and obviously that’s proven false over and over again. If anything, it’s just gotten worse since he died, not better, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t get up and you keep fighting, you know? You gotta fight, because they’re going to.” In the months after his dad’s murder, Gunn Jr. became an activist, speaking at abortion rights rallies across the country and fielding multiple media requests. It felt like a way to honor his dad’s memory. It’s how he ended up accepting an invitation a few days after his father’s death to go on “Donahue,” the national daytime talk show. “Had I known that Paul Hill was slated to be the anti-abortion co-guest, I would have turned down the invitation, but the producer was shrewd to withhold details of his ideology and plan prior to the show’s taping,” Gunn Jr. later recalled in a blog post about the invitation. “You see, Paul Hill felt my father’s murder was ‘justifiable homicide.’” Hill was a Presbyterian minister and militant anti-abortion activist who took the opportunity to tell Gunn Jr. to his face that his dad’s murder was comparable to killing a Nazi concentration camp doctor. Later that year, Hill penned a letter, signed by 33 supporters, defending the murder of doctors who performed abortions. “We assert that if Michael Griffin did in fact kill David Gunn, his use of lethal force was justifiable provided it was carried out for the purpose of defending the lives of unborn children,” the letter stated. The next year, Hill proved he meant what he’d written, opening fire outside a women’s health center — once again in Pensacola — and killing two people, Dr. John Bayard Britton and a clinic volunteer, James H. Barrett. Catherine Britton-Fairbanks found out her stepfather — Britton, the man who raised her — had been murdered while watching the evening news from her then-home in Boulder, Colorado. “They didn’t say his name or anything but just showed a white cloth lying on the ground in front of the clinic,” Britton-Fairbanks recalled to HuffPost. “So I ended up calling the Boulder Police to find out who it was that was murdered. And so then, I guess some advocates came to my door and confirmed that it was him that died.” Britton-Fairbanks remembers being both shocked and not particularly surprised. “I kind of suspected that someone would kill him, because there was an article in GQ a couple of months prior to the murder,” she said, referring to an article titled “The Abortionist,” which featured a photo of Britton in a white lab coat, a stethoscope slung around his neck and a .357 Magnum in his hand. “And I just had a premonition that he would get killed because he was just so out there and seemingly thinking that he was invincible. But that was not the case.” Britton was a complicated figure in the pro-choice world. He thought abortion was morally wrong but nevertheless felt people had the legal right to have them. He was also the only doctor willing to replace Gunn in Pensacola in the year after his murder. “I won’t be bluffed by fanatics,” his friends recounted him saying at the time. Britton traveled to the clinic wearing a homemade bulletproof vest. Hill shot him in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun. He also fatally shot Barrett, who was Britton’s volunteer bodyguard, and Barrett’s wife, who survived. Later, after Hill was convicted and sentenced to death, Britton-Fairbanks spoke out against him being executed, causing a deluge of interview requests from CNN, BBC and the “Today” show. “It just didn’t make sense to me, no matter who it is,” she recalled. “I just don’t think the death penalty is something that we have a right to do.” Hill was executed by lethal injection at Florida State Prison in 2003. Britton-Fairbanks shares some of her late stepfather’s ambivalence about abortion but is nevertheless worried about Roe v. Wade being overturned. “It’s kind of amazing that at this point in history that this would happen,” she said. “I would say that I’m not for abortion, and I’m not against. I just think it’s a woman’s right to choose what she does.” She’s worried about what the court could do next. “I suspect that they’ll be after trying to turn over other rights of women, and I guess the big thing that some folks are concerned about are the L…GBTQ — I can never remember the acronym — being overturned. There’s been some talk about that at the church that I go to, because there are a number of gay people there.” The most important thing Meghan Lowney wants you to know about her sister, Shannon Lowney, who was 25 when she gunned down in 1994 inside a Massachusetts women’s health clinic, is how wonderful she was. “My sister was an absolutely bright, sparkling, purposeful young woman,” Meghan said recently. “She was really somebody who always felt that her life was about making the world a better place, about a purpose greater than just her.” Lowney graduated magna cum laude with a degree in history from Boston College. She learned Spanish in order to assist Spanish-speaking clients at Planned Parenthood, where she worked as a receptionist. (“I’m not even sure some of the Spanish-speaking clients knew they were calling Planned Parenthood,” one of her co-workers remembered, according to a Boston Globe report. “But they knew to ask for Shannon.”) Shannon believed in the right to an abortion and routinely braved the gauntlet of protesters on her way to work. She moved to Maine for a little while, where she took a job counseling children about sexual abuse, but then returned to the Boston area, where she applied to a master’s program at the Boston University School of Social Work and resumed her job at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline. She didn’t feel well on the morning of Dec. 30, 1994. “She was sick, and I told her to stay home, but it was just typical of her that she was afraid that somebody would call and not be able to get the help they need,” her boyfriend at the time, David Keene, later recalled in a PBS interview. “I kissed her goodbye, and she ran across the street, and that’s the last last time I ever saw her.” For her sister, Meghan, the sequence of events that day is hazy. Someone in the family heard a report on the car radio about a shooting at the clinic, so Meghan, who lived in Connecticut, rushed to her parents’ house in nearby Fairfield and started calling Boston-area hospitals to see if Shannon was a patient. Eventually police arrived at the door. “You don’t want to open the door because you know that officer has bad news,” Meghan Lowney recalled. The police told them that a man, later identified as John Salvi, had walked into the Planned Parenthood and opened fire, killing Lowney. He then walked to another nearby clinic, Preterm, and opened fire there, killing another receptionist, 38-year-old Leann Nichols. Lowney and Nichols, according to reports at the time, had the sad distinction of being the first women assassinated by anti-abortion activists in the U.S. The following weeks were a blur of memorials and media requests and funerals. Shannon’s 88-year-old grandfather died just hours after being told about her death. (“Perhaps the news of Shannon’s murder was just too much to bear,” Meghan speculated.) Shannon was a pro-choice Catholic. The Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston, Bernard Cardinal Law, was not pro-choice but did cancel an annual anti-abortion rally in the city after the murders, which he called “unconscionable violence,” adding that the shootings “must not be confused with the millions who advocate a pro-life position in peace.” (Law resigned in disgrace eight years later, after a Boston Globe investigation revealed that for decades he’d covered up widespread child sexual abuse committed by dozens of priests.) All these years later, it saddens Meghan that her sister’s death, and Nichols’ death, weren’t the last acts of deadly anti-abortion terror. “I regret that my sister’s murder and our loss of Shannon wasn’t enough to change hearts and minds, and that violence continued and that the pursuit of overturning Roe persisted,” she said. Meghan hasn’t talked to the press in a long time about her sister’s murder, having developed some skepticism about how useful it was to do so. But when HuffPost contacted her recently, she said she felt like it was time to break her silence. “What we’ve done isn’t enough,” she said of the battle to preserve a woman’s right to choose. “We’ve all, each of us, got to figure out a way to do more, to risk feeling uncomfortable in trying to be part of a solution, even when we don’t know what the solution is, and that is sometimes what is so uncomfortable about it.” Still, for someone who lost a loved one to political violence, Meghan has faith in the power of dialogue and suspects the solution to what ails our politics isn’t more division. “I think the answer isn’t more polarization and more, you know, pointing fingers or more feeling like that person is the ‘other,’ quote unquote, but the opposite: that we have to find ways when we don’t agree to listen and to understand and really try to connect with other people.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,The Problem With Asking Someone Why They Got An Abortion,politics," Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. So often when we hear about a person’s abortion experience, the follow-up question starts with why: “Why did you get your abortion?” While it’s sometimes well-meaning, the question itself can quickly become problematic. Are some reasons for getting an abortion better than others? If so, how are those reasons weaponized to legitimize one person’s abortion over another person’s? Say a teenage girl was raped and became pregnant. Is her decision to have an abortion more justified than a mother of two who simply can’t afford a third child? Is that mother’s reasoning better than, say, a person who became pregnant despite being on birth control and simply doesn’t want children? Is not wanting children a good enough reason to get an abortion? Many lawmakers and advocates who back abortion rights point to the wave of no-exception abortion bans as an example of just how cruel these restrictions are. Last fall, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Texas’ six-week abortion ban, writing that its “purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade” and it “even refuses to make exceptions for cases of rape and incest.” And just last month, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) shamed “MAGA Republicans” who are pushing a “national abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.” To be sure, these lawmakers want to protect abortion access for everyone, but even the ways their arguments are sometimes framed can encourage focusing on only the most extreme cases in abortion care. The justification of abortion care is a slippery slope, but it’s deeply ingrained in how we, as a society, discuss abortion ― both as health care and a hot-button political issue. It can be seen in discussions between talking heads on TV, arguments between lawmakers on the floors of state legislatures and around dinner tables across the country. “The justification of abortion care is a slippery slope, but it’s deeply engrained in how we, as a society, discuss abortion.” But researchers at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a leading research group at the University of California, San Francisco, argue that the reasoning behind an individual’s choice to get an abortion should be insignificant. “We question this question: Why do we need to know why people choose abortion?” Dr. Katrina Kimport, an associate professor at ANSIRH, and Dr. Monica McLemore, a clinician-scientist at ANSIRH, wrote in a research paper published earlier this year on the topic of justifying abortions. This focus on justifying abortion is “misplaced,” Kimport told HuffPost. “Really, I think the answer to that question is that it may be a health service or a clinical need, but it’s not actually a broader need,” she said. “Instead, there’s real value to trying to center pregnant people and insist on their autonomy to make decisions that are best for them.” HuffPost spoke with Kimport about her and McLemore’s research, their argument against justifying abortion care, and how this ideology could be further weaponized if Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting abortion care, falls this month. In your paper, you and Dr. McLemore argue against the “justification for the presence of abortion in a society” or, essentially, that there must be a good reason for abortion care to exist. Can you give me some examples of how this plays out in public discourse ― how people maybe knowingly or unknowingly try to justify certain abortions versus others? This pattern of justifying abortions is something we’ve seen across the research literature but also in a lot of public discourse. There are a lot of ways that happens and it happens across the spectrum of people’s support for or opposition to abortion. For example, most public opinion polls around abortion ask questions like, “Do you think abortion should be legal in some, all or no cases?” Even that phrasing invites the person who’s taking the poll to be in a position to make a judgment, to make a decision. And these questions are being asked when abortion is legal. The way society encourages conversation around abortion invites people to make judgments. They’re not thinking about themselves, they’re thinking about what they would be talking about in an abstract case. The basic framework of those polls often informs how media and politicians talk about abortion. That’s the initial entry point into a lot of these discussions. And it is built on an idea that this is the legitimate question and we are all legitimate answerers of that question for other people. Why is it problematic when people attempt to justify abortion care? Dr. McLemore and I have three primary concerns that we laid out in our research paper. The first is that when there’s an effort to justify abortion and abortion decisions. It then presumes that justification is necessary and that it’s able to be rendered. And that it can be rendered by a third party who’s not actually involved in the pregnancy. So, as soon as you start talking about how to justify something, you’ve already implied that it is a responsible and reasonable thing to do. And we question that ― whether or not justification of abortion is necessary and even possible ― especially by somebody who’s not directly involved in the pregnancy. The second critique that we had was this question of, where are the pregnant people? So many of these conversations take a population-level approach to justification of abortion that then misses out on the actual needs and wants of pregnant people in their decision-making and in their lives. And that’s a second concern we have about these large-scale ideas of justification, the sort of erasure of the actual person that’s at the center of this. And the third critique Dr. McLemore and I have relates to this idea that not everyone’s reproduction is encouraged and rewarded, and some populations are actively discouraged from reproducing. When the idea that certain circumstances make abortion justifiable, what happens then to people in those circumstances who want to continue the pregnancy? Their decision-making becomes suspect. So, essentially, if we are trying to justify or legitimize a person’s decision to have an abortion then it also creates this slippery slope where we need to justify a person’s decision to continue a pregnancy. Did I get that right? Yeah, but I’d offer a little nuance to that. For example, some people say, “Well, here’s somebody who is already parenting three children and is financially struggling. Those are good reasons for that person to have an abortion.” But what happens when there is somebody who is parenting three children and financially struggling who desires to continue a pregnancy? To offer another example, one of the reasons for abortion that the general public is consistently comfortable with are situations where there is a serious health issue with the fetus. What happens then for people who have a similar diagnosis or observed fetal health issue who desire to continue the pregnancy? And maybe they don’t have the resources for all of the necessary medical needs. You end up in situations where, again, the pregnant person is removed from the situation. And so just as somebody’s circumstances may justify abortion, for somebody in similar circumstances who wants to continue the pregnancy that eliminates their pathway. “Our social ideas of whose abortion is legitimate owes both to the circumstances of the abortion and also the person themselves. Certain people are considered more legitimate and more deserving of care, and that absolutely overlaps with a lot of the existing patterns of racism and classism and sexism.” I reported out a piece in April about how so many of these newer abortion restrictions have very little or no exceptions included in the legislation. One thing I came across while reporting is this argument in “pro-choice circles” that focusing on the lack of exceptions in these bills actually furthers the idea that there are good or bad abortions ― or abortions that are maybe more justified than others. What do you make of that argument? I understand some of the desire to carve out particular instances that people think there might be greater sympathy for when it comes to abortion care. One of the things that happens, though, is it suggests that somebody on the outside can determine what should be legitimate and what should not. And once you have that logic ― that it’s appropriate for the government to intervene in these decisions ― it’s really hard to get to a point where that pregnant person’s desires are centered. Can you talk to me a bit about how this dialogue surrounding the justification of abortion intersects with certain people or communities more than others? There are definitely ways in which differential access to health care is mapped onto class, geography and race. Especially because of the United States’ history of a racial wealth gap, which speaks to red-lining and the ongoing legacy of slavery and racism, that tends to overlap very closely with class and geography. Our social ideas of whose abortion is legitimate owes both to the circumstances of the abortion and also the person themselves. Certain people are considered more legitimate and more deserving of care, and that absolutely overlaps with a lot of the existing patterns of racism and classism and sexism. Indeed, all of these things are tied into this idea that’s forming in the literature right now around an abortion imaginary: Who is it that people see when they’re trying to imagine a justified abortion? Given the Supreme Court draft leak, it seems likely that the court will overturn Roe in just a few weeks. What are you most worried about right now? As an expert in this field but also within the context of a culture where certain people’s abortions and health care needs are already legitimized or justified over others? I am worried that the production of scrutiny of some people and some bodies will be renewed and further entrenched. With the continued role of justification for abortion ― and with what we anticipate to be a patchwork of access to abortion ― what all of this invites is more suspicion, skepticism and scrutiny of pregnant people. Weeks away from the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe, what do you hope lawmakers, researchers and others in positions of power will keep in mind when discussing abortion care and how it relates to a patient’s personal decision and choice? The really simple answer is people are trustworthy and they can be trusted to make decisions that work best for them. This is about real people, and their perspectives, needs and wants should be centered in this conversation. Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost"
15,NYC Protesters Blast Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis At Conservative Event,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) knew he wasn’t in Florida anymore when a crowd of activists protested his appearance Sunday at a conference in Manhattan hosted by a conservative organization. The Jewish Leadership Conference was organized by the Tikvah Fund, and held at the Chelsea Piers recreational center in the heart of one of the most vibrant LGBTQ communities in the city. The timing was particularly insensitive, given DeSantis’ recent crackdown on the LGBTQ community in his state and during Pride month. It was also the 6-year anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, a bustling gay establishment in Orlando, that killed 49 people. Activists waved signs reading: “Florida man go home” and “Don’t Say DeSantis” — a dig at the “Don’t Say Gay” bill he signed into law earlier this year. The law forbids classroom discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation for some age groups in Florida schools. “The bottom line is Chelsea Piers is providing a venue to propagate hate toward the LGBTQ community, and that is unacceptable on many levels, including that it is Pride [month] and that it is in Chelsea, the heart of the community,” said Democratic state Sen. Brad Hoylman, who represents the area. The Tikvah Fund declined to discuss the controversy and Chelsea Piers said it won’t police the content of events at the facility. A spokesperson in DeSantis’ office wouldn’t comment on the protests or timing, but emphasized the governor’s support for religious freedom and Israel. DeSantis was reportedly the close-out speaker at the conference and touted his “Florida model” as something good for religion.

16,"Mark Meadows Burned Papers After Talk About Tossing Election Results, Ex-Aide Says",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows destroyed documents after a meeting about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, a former aide said Sunday on CNN. Alyssa Farah Griffin said a source with “first-hand knowledge” provided testimony to the House panel probing the insurrection that Meadows burned papers in his office after meeting with Rep. Scott Perry (R-Penn.) about challenging the election. “I expect to see that come out in testimony” before the House committee investigating the insurrection, she added. Another former Meadows aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, said she watched Meadows burn the documents in her account before House select committee investigators, Politico reported last month. The meeting with Perry occurred an unspecified number of weeks after the election while Trump and supporters were desperately casting around for ways to change the vote, according to Politico. Hutchinson also told the panel that Meadows was warned of possible violence on Jan. 6, 2021, but it was unclear what action, if any, he took in response. Griffin may have been referring to Cassidy as her source with first-hand knowledge of the destruction of documents by Meadows. Hutchinson is expected to testify in the ongoing televised hearings held by the House panel. Perry was pressuring Meadows to take action regarding the election, according to his emails to Meadows released by the House committee. “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!” he wrote to Meadows late last year in one of the messages. Perry was one of “multiple” Republican lawmakers who asked the Trump administration for pardons following the insurrection, House committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said at the hearing last week. But Perry’s office denied that. The full extent of Meadows’ role in the insurrection, or what possible charges he could face, is not yet clear.

1,Jan. 6 Panelists: Enough Evidence Uncovered To Indict Trump,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of the House committee investigating the Capitol riot said Sunday they have uncovered enough evidence for the Justice Department to consider an unprecedented criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee announced that Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, is among the witnesses scheduled to testify at a hearing Monday that focuses on Trump’s effort to spread his lies about a stolen election. Stepien was subpoenaed for his public testimony. As the hearings unfold, Rep. Adam Schiff said he would like the department to “investigate any credible allegation of criminal activity on the part of Donald Trump.” Schiff, D-Calif., who also leads the House Intelligence Committee, said that ”there are certain actions, parts of these different lines of effort to overturn the election that I don’t see evidence the Justice Department is investigating.” The committee launched its public hearings last week, with members laying out their case against Trump to show how the defeated president relentlessly pushed his false claims of a rigged election despite multiple advisers telling him otherwise and how he intensified an extraordinary scheme to overturn Joe Biden’s victory. Additional evidence is to be released in hearings this week, Democrats say, that will demonstrate that Trump and some of his advisers engaged in a “massive effort” to spread misinformation, pressured the Justice Department to embrace his false claims, and urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject state electors and block the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021. Stepien, a longtime Trump ally, is now a top campaign adviser to the Trump-endorsed House candidate in Wyoming’s Republican primary, Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee’s vice chair and a vociferous critic of the former president. A Trump spokesman, Taylor Budowich, suggested that the committee’s decision to call Stepien was politically motivated. Monday’s witness list also includes BJay Pak, the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta who left his position on Jan. 4, 2021, a day after an audio recording was made public in which Trump called him a “never-Trumper”; Chris Stirewalt, the former political editor for Fox News; noted Washington elections attorney Benjamin Ginsberg; and Al Schmidt, a former city commissioner in Philadelphia. The panel will also focus on the millions of dollars Trump’s team brought in fundraising in the run-up to Jan. 6, according to a committee aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the details. The committee has said most of those interviewed in the investigation are coming forward voluntarily, although some have wanted subpoenas to appear in public. Filmmaker Nick Quested, who provided documentary footage of the attack, said during last week’s hearing he received a subpoena to appear. Committee members said they would present clear evidence that “multiple” GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., had sought a pardon from Trump, which would protect him from prosecution. Perry on Friday denied he ever did so, calling the assertion an “absolute, shameless, and soulless lie.” “We’re not going to make accusations or say things without proof or evidence backing it,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. Lawmakers indicated that perhaps their most important audience member over the course of the hearings may be Attorney General Merrick Garland, who must decide whether his department can and should prosecute Trump. They left no doubt as to their own view whether the evidence is sufficient to proceed. “Once the evidence is accumulated by the Justice Department, it needs to make a decision about whether it can prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the president’s guilt or anyone else’s,” Schiff said. “But they need to be investigated if there’s credible evidence, which I think there is.” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said he doesn’t intend to “browbeat” Garland but noted the committee has already laid out in legal pleadings criminal statutes they believe Trump violated. “I think that he knows, his staff knows, the U.S. attorneys know, what’s at stake here,” Raskin said. “They know the importance of it, but I think they are rightfully paying close attention to precedent in history as well, as the facts of this case.” Garland has not specified whether he would be willing to prosecute, which would be unprecedented and may be complicated in a political election season in which Trump has openly flirted with the idea of running for president again. No president or ex-president has ever been indicted. Richard Nixon resigned from office in 1974 as he faced an impeachment and a likely grand jury indictment on charges of bribery, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. President Gerald Ford later pardoned his predecessor before any criminal charges related to Watergate could be filed. Legal experts have said a Justice Department prosecution of Trump over the riot could set an uneasy precedent in which an administration of one party could more routinely go after the former president of another. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead,” Garland said in his speech at Harvard University’s commencement ceremony last month. A federal judge in California said in a March ruling in a civil case that Trump “more likely than not” committed federal crimes in seeking to obstruct the congressional count of the Electoral College ballots on Jan. 6, 2021. The judge cited two statutes: obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.

2,Mary Trump Says Former President 'Accused' Ivanka Of Perjury After Jan. 6 Hearing,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump’s niece Mary Trump said in an interview Sunday that the former president “accused” daughter Ivanka of “perjury” when he attacked her after her testimony in the televised Jan. 6 hearing. In a videotaped snippet of her testimony aired at last Thursday’s hearing by the House panel probing the insurrection, Ivanka Trump said she accepted former Attorney General Bill Barr’s determination that the presidential election was not rigged, as her dad claimed. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying,” she said. Donald Trump fired back on social media that his daughter was “checked out,” knew none of the details of the election, and was “only trying to be respectful to Bill Bar and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!).” Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results. She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!). Mary Trump told MSNBC she regarded the former president’s comment as “accusing” his daughter of “perjury.” She referred specifically to Trump saying his daughter had “checked out.” But the former president also suggested Ivanka said what she did only out of “respect for Barr,” indicating she did not necessarily believe him. Otherwise, the father-and-daughter behavior was “exactly what I expected from both of them,” said Mary Trump. “I think Ivanka walked a very fine line,” she explained. “She did not say anything necessarily incendiary but, as we thought would happen, she decided she needed to come down on the side of what the facts support.” As for Donald Trump, he “didn’t entirely throw her under the bus,” his niece said. Mary Trump predicted that their future connection will depend on if they can still benefit from one another. Their relationship, “whether they seem close or not, is entirely transactional,” she explained. “Once one or both of them come to the conclusion that there’s nothing in it for them, then they will move on.” Trump, who’s a psychologist, believes her uncle both “understands” that he lost the 2020 presidential election yet absolutely cannot face being a “loser.” He “cannot go there,” she said. “Being a loser is just utterly unacceptable” for him. “At this late date, one of the reasons people find the ’big lie’ so convincing ... is because Donald has come to believe it to a degree that makes the lie sound authentic,” Trump explained. She said she wasn’t “surprised at all” that her uncle supported the call to “hang” former Vice President Mike Pence, as recounted at the hearing by Jan. 6 House Panel Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). Check out the full interview in the video clip above. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Rudy Giuliani Insists Trump Had 'Nothing To Do' With Jan. 6 Insurrection,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Besides lying that the presidential election was rigged, inviting supporters to D.C. for a “wild” time, and telling people to march to the U.S. Capitol and “fight like hell” on Jan. 6, 2021, Donald Trump had absolutely “nothing to do” with the events that day, insisted his former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani was responding to the dramatic hearing last Thursday by the House select committee exposing planning for the event and to overturn the election spearheaded by Trump that preceded the violence. Giuliani called the hearing an “embarrassment.” “I assure you, as I assured you about [the] stolen election, this was not an insurrection or a coup,” Giuliani said Saturday on his podcast, “Common Sense.” “The president had nothing to do with it, and none of the people close to the president did,” he added. “The way in which they’re being treated is an indication of the fascist-type government that the Bidens, the Pelosis, the socialists, who always like fascist-type government ... will run, as long as you keep them in office.” Rudy responds to the J6 hearing: “I assure you, this was not an insurrection or a coup. The president had nothing to do with it, and none of the people close to the president did. And the way in which they’re being treated is an indication of the fascist-type govt of the Bidens.” pic.twitter.com/l8srSH03RI Giuliani termed the violence at the Capitol a “spontaneous” riot. He also suggested without any evidence that the leftist antifa was significantly involved in an event Trump just described last week as the “greatest movement in the history of our country to Make America Great Again.” …January 6th was not simply a protest, it represented the greatest movement in the history of our Country to Make America Great Again. It was about an Election that was Rigged and Stolen, and a Country that was about to go to HELL..& look at our Country now! Giuliani himself was deeply involved in attempts to overthrow the 2020 election. He was reportedly a key player in presenting slates of fake electors to replace legitimately chosen electors in certain states in a bid to overthrow the results. The Republican electors declared themselves “duly elected and qualified,” and sent signed certificates to Washington claiming to affirm Trump as the winner in five states he had actually lost. Early this year, Dana Nessel, attorney general of Michigan, which was one of the state’s involved, described the operation an “open-and-shut case of forgery of a public record,” and called for a federal investigation. “This is not political theater. It’s not protected speech,” Nessel said. “It’s an attack on the very fabric of our system of government.” Last week the disciplinary branch of the District of Columbia Bar Association filed ethics charges against Giuliani alleging that he promoted unsubstantiated voter fraud claims in Pennsylvania. Last June, an appeals court suspended Giuliani from practicing law in New York because he made false statements in a bid to get courts to overturn Trump’s defeat. His D.C. law license was also suspended. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

11,Brookings President Resigns Amid FBI Foreign Lobbying Probe,politics," The president of the Brookings Institution resigned Sunday amid a federal investigation into whether he illegally lobbied on behalf of the wealthy Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. Retired Gen. John Allen wrote in a letter to the think tank that he was leaving with a “heavy heart” but did not offer a direct explanation. “I know it is best for all concerned in this moment,” Allen’s letter said. A retired four-star Marine general who led U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Allen’s announcement came less than a week after the Associated Press was first to report on new court filings that showed the FBI had seized Allen’s electronic data as part of the lobbying probe. Allen has not been charged with any crimes and, through a spokesman, has denied any wrongdoing. Brookings, which had put Allen on administrative leave the day after the AP’s initial report, issued a statement thanking Allen for guiding the think tank through the coronavirus pandemic and other contributions. The institution said information about the search for a new president would be forthcoming. The new court filings detail Allen’s behind-the scenes efforts to help Qatar influence U.S. policy in June 2017 when a diplomatic crisis erupted between the gas-rich Persian Gulf monarchy and its neighbors. An FBI agent said in an affidavit in support of a search warrant there was “substantial evidence” that Allen had knowingly broken a foreign lobbying law, and had made false statements and withheld “incriminating” documents. Allen’s alleged lobbying work involved traveling to Qatar and meeting with the country’s top officials to offer them advice on how to influence U.S. policy, as well as promoting Qatar’s point of view to top White House officials and members of Congress, the FBI’s affidavit says. The federal investigation involving Allen has already ensnared Richard G. Olson, a former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan who pleaded guilty to federal charges earlier this month, and Imaad Zuberi, a prolific political donor now serving a 12-year prison sentence on corruption charges. Several members of Congress have also been interviewed. Brookings, one of the most prestigious think thanks in the U.S., had initially hired Allen as a senior fellow before tapping him as president in late 2017 and paying him more than $1 million a year, according to recent tax records. “The integrity and objectivity of Brookings’s scholarship constitute the institution’s principal assets, and Brookings seeks to maintain high ethical standards in all its operations,” the think tank said in its statement Sunday. Qatar has long been a major financial backer of Brookings, though Allen decided in 2019 to stop taking any new donations from the country. Qatari officials have not responded to requests for comment about the Allen investigation. ___ Suderman reported from Richmond, Virginia, Mustian from New Orleans. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/ Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,What To Expect From The Second Public Jan. 6 Committee Hearing,politics," Assignment Editor, Breaking News The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol will hold a second public hearing Monday as it continues to present its findings related to former President Donald Trump’s role in the violence that day. The hearing was scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET, but the committee said Monday it would be delayed about 30 to 45 minutes as one of the witnesses dropped out. The first hearing aired for two hours on prime-time television on Thursday and drew 20 million viewers. All broadcast and cable news networks except Fox News carried the hearing live. The committee has six public hearings planned in total, and at least one more will be during prime time. During the first hearing, the committee released never-before-seen video of the violence and showed testimony from former Attorney General William Barr and Ivanka Trump, Trump’s daughter and former White House adviser. Trump responded to the first hearing with a barrage of messages on his Truth Social app, his main method of communicating with supporters since he was banned from Twitter for spreading election falsehoods. You can catch up here on the big moments you might have missed from the first hearing. Here’s what to expect from the next round: Jamie Raskin on CNN says he thinks the January 6 committee can prove that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election while he was lying about it and trying to overturn the result pic.twitter.com/eeZG1q7r8n Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee’s vice chair, said last week that the second hearing will show that Trump and his advisers knew he lost the election to President Joe Biden, but that, despite this, Trump “engaged in a massive effort to spread false and fraudulent information to convince huge portions of the U.S. population that fraud had stolen the election from him.” Barr’s testimony aired Thursday already touched on this point. Barr said he told Trump his claims around election fraud were “bullshit” and that he did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen. We can expect more testimony and findings from people in Trump’s orbit saying they told him he had lost the election and there was no evidence to support Trump’s allegations. The committee will also focus on the fundraising that Trump’s team brought in leading up to the events of Jan. 6, a source told the Associated Press. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said Sunday that the committee could “prove to any reasonable, open-minded person that Donald Trump absolutely knew” he lost. “Any reasonable person in America will tell you, he had to have known he was spreading a big lie, and he continues to spread it to this very day,” Raskin told CNN. Hearing➡️Monday at 10:00amPanel 1•William Stepien, Former Trump Campaign Manager•Chris Stirewalt, Former Fox Political EditorPanel 2•Benjamin Ginsberg, Election Attorney•BJay Pak, Former US Attorney Northern District of GA•Al Schmidt, Former Philadelphia City Commr The committee on Monday said that Bill Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager in 2020, is unable to attend the hearing due to a “family emergency” and his counsel would appear and give a statement instead. The change will delay the hearing’s start time by about 30 to 45 minutes, it said. Stepien was subpoenaed by the committee in November 2021. In the committee’s letter to him, they said Stepien “supervised the conversion of the Trump presidential campaign to an effort focused on ‘Stop the Steal’ messaging and related fundraising.” The committee said the messaging “included the promotion of certain false claims related to voting machines despite an internal campaign memo in which campaign staff determined such claims were false.” Stepien is now an adviser to Trump-endorsed House candidate in Wyoming, Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Cheney. Ben Ginsberg, a Republican attorney who is considered an expert on elections, will testify there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, according to CNN. He will also testify on the many failed legal challenges by Trump’s team. CNN cited sources on Ginsberg’s testimony, as the committee investigating Jan. 6 hasn’t publicly released the names of those testifying. Ginsberg played a crucial role in the 2000 presidential recount and defeat of Al Gore to George W. Bush. He also criticized Trump in a November 2020 opinion piece in The Washington Post, saying Trump had launched an “all-out, multimillion-dollar effort to disenfranchise voters.” Chris Stirewalt, a former Fox News political editor, is set to testify Monday. While Stirewalt said he couldn’t discuss exactly what his testimony will be, it should be related to the committee’s theme of what Trump and his team knew versus how they acted. Stirewalt was fired from the network in January 2021 after receiving right-wing backlash to his decision to call Arizona for Biden on election night 2020, which reportedly infuriated Trump. Stirewalt defended his decision in an editorial in the Los Angeles Times in January 2021 and criticized American media. “Having been cosseted by self-validating coverage for so long, many Americans now consider any news that might suggest that they are in error or that their side has been defeated as an attack on them personally,” he wrote.

He also responded to Trump’s claim that the president tried to reach out to the National Guard during the violence after testimony showed then-Vice President Mike Pence had to jump in when the president wouldn’t. “I think it’s very obvious that the president didn’t do anything but gleefully watch television when this was going down,” Kinzinger told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” This story has been updated with information on Stepien’s appearance and the hearing start time.

13,Senators Announce Outline Of Bipartisan Gun Deal,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators announced a deal on an outline of a bill meant to address gun violence, with modest curbs on obtaining firearms and aid for mental health and schools. “Today, we are announcing a commonsense, bipartisan proposal to protect America’s children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across our country. Families are scared, and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities,” the group said in a statement on Sunday. “We look forward to earning broad, bipartisan support and passing our commonsense proposal into law.” The group counts 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans ― the latter number suggesting the agreement may be able to overcome a filibuster. Their outline is an agreement on principles and still needs to be turned into legislative text, however, a task that is usually more difficult to complete. “Obviously, it does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday, urging its passage. The agreement includes funding to bolster mental health, enhanced background checks for people under 21, “red flag” laws and school security measures. It would also close the “boyfriend loophole,” which would stop people from buying a gun if they are convicted of abuse against their partner. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, safe storage rules at homes, or required background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. The accused gunmen in the recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, are 18-year-olds who legally purchased their semi-automatic weapons. “Today’s announcement of a bipartisan gun-safety framework is a good first step to ending the persistent inaction to the gun violence epidemic. ... Once the text of this agreement is finalized, I will put this bill on the floor as soon as possible,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement Sunday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also encouraged the talks to continue, though he stopped short of endorsing the deal outright. Securing McConnell’s support would make passage of the bill more likely. “I appreciate their hard work on this important issue. The principles they announced today show the value of dialogue and cooperation,” McConnell said Sunday. News of the agreement follows nationwide protests calling for action to address gun violence, including a large rally in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, welcomed the news on Sunday. This is a first step and it’s actually a lot more than I thought it would be. This is progress even if small. Even if it stops one parkland it’s worth it.

14,Sarah Palin Nabs Early Lead In Alaska U.S. House Special Primary,politics," JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin leads in early results from Saturday’s special primary for the state’s only U.S. House seat, as voters whittled down the list of 48 candidates running for the position that was held for 49 years by the late U.S. Rep. Don Young. The early results showed Palin, endorsed by former President Donald Trump, with 29.8% of the votes counted so far; Republican Nick Begich had 19.3%; independent Al Gross had 12.5%; Democrat Mary Peltola with 7.5%; and Republican Tara Sweeney had 5.3%. A candidate whose name is Santa Claus, a self-described “independent, progressive, democratic socialist,” had 4.5%. The initial results released by the state Division of Elections included 108,729 votes. It was not immediately clear how many ballots were outstanding. The division reported late Saturday that it had received about 139,000 ballots so far. Ballots had to be postmarked by Saturday. The Associated Press has not called any winners in the special primary. The top four vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, will advance to an August special election in which ranked choice voting will be used. The winner of the special election will serve the remainder of Young’s term, which ends in January. Young died in March at age 88. This election was unlike any the state has seen, crammed with candidates and conducted primarily by mail. This was the first election, too, under a system approved by voters in 2020 that ends party primaries and uses ranked choice voting in general elections. Saturday marked the first ballot count; state elections officials plan additional counts on Wednesday and Friday, and a final count on June 21. They have targeted June 25 to certify the race. Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, released a statement expressing gratitude “to all of my wonderful supporters who voted to make Alaska great again!” Earlier Saturday, the Alaska Supreme Court reversed and vacated a lower court order that had barred state election officials from certifying the results of the special primary until visually impaired voters were given a “full and fair” opportunity to participate. Attorneys for the state had interpreted Friday’s order from Superior Court Judge Una Gandbhir as preventing elections officials from concluding voting as scheduled on Saturday. They asked the supreme court to reverse the order. The ruling came in a case filed days earlier by Robert Corbisier, executive director of the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights. Corbisier sued state elections officials on behalf of a person identified as B.L., a registered voter in Anchorage with a visual impairment. The sheer number of candidates left some voters overwhelmed, and many of the candidates themselves faced challenges in setting up a campaign on the fly and trying to leave an impression on voters in a short period of time. The candidate filing deadline was April 1. Relatively few candidates were running for the seat before Young’s death. Begich was among the early entrants; he launched his campaign last fall and worked to win support among conservatives. The businessman, who hails from a family of prominent Democrats, was endorsed by the Alaska Republican party. Peltola, a former state lawmaker from Bethel who has been involved in fisheries issues, said earlier this week that she entered the race with low name recognition but believes she’s changed that and has momentum behind her candidacy. Palin’s run marks her first bid for elected office since resigning as governor partway through her term in 2009. She was endorsed in this campaign by some national political figures, including Trump, who participated in a “telerally” for her and said Palin would “fight harder than anybody I can think of,” particularly on energy issues. Palin sought to assure voters that she is serious about her bid and committed to Alaska. During the campaign, opponents poked at that. Gross, an orthopedic surgeon who made an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in 2020, said Palin “quit on Alaska.” Begich and Sweeney made points of saying they are not quitters. Gross, in an email to supporters during the campaign, said Palin and Begich are candidates who will be hard to beat but said he is “ready and able to take on this fight.” Sweeney was assistant secretary of Indian Affairs in the U.S. Interior Department under Trump and was endorsed by a group that represents leaders of the state’s influential Alaska Native regional corporations. She said she understands the “pressure cooker” environment of Washington, D.C. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Trump Reportedly Misusing Presidential Seal To Boost Business At 4th Golf Course,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump is using the presidential seal at a fourth golf course to help enhance his business in what could be a violation of the law, Forbes is reporting. An Instagram post recently featured a photo of the seal, with the official circular, blue-and-silver design, being used as a tee marker at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The Instagram caption reads: “45th President 45 yards from hole on 18.” A post shared by Edmund Ruffin (@edruf) It’s against the law to use the presidential seal in a way that could convey the impression of government approval or sponsorship of a private business. Violations can result in prison sentences of up to six months. The seal can only be used for official government business. The course is the fourth Trump property to use the seal in possible violation of the law, according to Forbes. Presidential seals have also been used at his courses in the Bronx, New Jersey and in Jupiter, Florida. A 2018 podcast produced by ProPublica and WNYC reported “dozens” of the markers similar to those seen recently being used at Trump courses. At the time, the Trump Organization blamed the markers on super fans, and quickly got rid of them when the story emerged. “The plaques were presented to the club by a small group of members, who are incredible fans of the president, in honor of President’s Day weekend. They were temporary and have since been removed,” said a statement from the Trump Organization. But the podcast had obtained an order form for the markers, listing them as being purchased by “Trump International.” The law concerning use of the presidential seal is an “expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose,” Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in government and legal ethics, told ProPublica at the time. “It would be a misuse of government authority.” Trump has used his office in several ways to enhance his private businesses. Lobbyists, lawmakers and foreign nations often booked rooms and hosted lavish parties while he was president at his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., reportedly to curry favor with him. He has also charged the Secret Service at least $2 million to stay in rooms and eat food at his properties. And he has gone out of his way to travel to his foreign golf courses with a large entourage — at taxpayer expense — to highlight the properties in international news stories. The Trump Organization could not immediately be reached for comment. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,31 Patriot Front Extremists Aiming To 'Riot' At Idaho Pride Event Arrested: Officials,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Idaho police on Saturday arrested 31 members of the Patriot Front hate group who planned to “riot” at a Pride event in downtown Coeur d’Alene, officials announced. Members of the group — who all appeared to be white men — were crammed into a U-Haul truck and were discovered when it was pulled over by police who had received a tip from a “concerned citizen.” The tipster saw the members of the white supremacist organization — which “looked like a little army” — loading into the truck with masks and shields, according to officials. Police also found shin guards, at least one smoke bomb, and what was described as an “operations plan,” which officials declined to detail. They wore arm bands and hat patches saying “Patriot Front,” according to police. The members were nabbed close to an area where a Coeur d’Alene LGBTQ Pride event was taking place. Photos and video from the scene when they were arrested show the members dressed almost identically in khakis, navy blue shirts, beige hats, and a white cloth covering their faces. Some of the T-shirts included slogans such as “Reclaim America.” holy shit. patriot front detained pic.twitter.com/uIIZeXn6Ci Patriot Front getting pulled over in thier uhaul before being detained. #CoeurDAlene#FuckNazis pic.twitter.com/BV6itvs2se “They came to riot downtown,” Coeur d’Alene Police Chief Lee White said at a news conference (see the video up top). All have been charged with conspiracy to riot. White said police had received information for days that there were plans by various right-wing extremists to disrupt Pride events in town. Consequently, there was a strong police contingent on duty, and the arrests were made without incident, he said. He thanked the “extremely astute citizen” who alerted police about the men. White said he personally did not see firearms, but the search was just beginning, including at a hotel where the men were staying. He also said local police officials were in contact with the FBI “all day.” Based on material collected from the truck, the men planned to riot in a number of locations, according to police. “It appears they did not come here to engage in peaceful events,” Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris told the Coeur d’Alene Press. The North Idaho News later Saturday listed the names of 18 of those arrested following an interview with White after processing. They’re being held in the Kootenai County Jail and are scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Norris emphasized at the news conference that information was only preliminary and that an investigation was continuing into any other possible activities the group may have been plotting. Those arrested came from at least 11 states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Illinois, Wyoming, Virginia and Arkansas. watch patriot front get unmasked live😂😂😂https://t.co/9E5CpopE8B Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,"Trump Botched His 'Coup' By Not Marching To Capitol Jan. 6, Says Expert On Autocrats",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump may have remained in power despite losing the presidential election had he marched with his supporters to breach the U.S. Capitol during last year’s insurrection, according to an expert on fascist leaders and movements. The Secret Service reportedly explored ways to protect Trump when he told agents he wanted to accompany his followers to the building after urging them to march on the Capitol, the Jan. 6 House panel discovered in its probe. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol ,” he told a crowd of supporters. But Trump was ultimately told it wasn’t possible in the spur of the moment, The Washington Post reported. “If you’re having a coup and summoned everybody, and you expect to be anointed as the head of a new illegitimate government, you have to be there,” New York University History Professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat told CNN’s Jim Acosta Saturday. “There’s a phase in coups,” explained Ben-Ghiat, author of the book “Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present.” They’re “violent, quick, and then you have your pronouncement of the new order. That’s why he [Trump] was trying to get there.” Ben-Ghiat said she was pleased that Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) used the word “coup” during the hearing Thursday by the Jan. 6 House committee when describing the events leading up to and including the storming of the Capitol. “It’s the right word for something that’s the result of a process that started — in a sense it started before November 2020 because Trump had been trying to discredit elections for several years, and forming his personality cult so the faithful would rally when he summoned them,” she said. Ben-Ghiat noted that coups can take “months or years to plan, and this was a multi-pronged attempt to overthrow our democracy.” Ultimately, she said, Trump “went nuclear and did what autocrats have done in the past, and used violence, and summoned these people there to right this ‘monstrous’ wrong on his behalf.” Acosta said in his introduction: “The call to arms was coming from inside the White House.” Check out Ben-Ghiat’s full interview in the clip above. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) talks about Trump’s misinformation campaign leading up to the violence at 7:25, which is followed by Ben-Ghiat’s observations.

2,"Trump Trapped By 'Ego' In 2020; GOP Should Leave Him There, Slams New York Post",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A scathing editorial in Saturday’s New York Post lashed former President Donald Trump for “obsessing” over the 2020 presidential election, and urged Republicans to abandon him in the past and move on. “Trump has become a prisoner of his own ego,” slammed the conservative newspaper controlled by longtime Trump supporter Rupert Murdoch. “He can’t admit his tweeting and narcissism turned off millions. He won’t stop insisting that 2020 was ‘stolen’ even though he’s offered no proof that it’s true.” Respected officials like former Attorney General Bill Barr call his rants “nonsense,” the editorial added. “This isn’t just about Liz Cheney. Mitch McConnell, Betsy DeVos, Mark Meadows — they all knew Trump was delusional. His own daughter and son-in-law testified it was bull.” Trump’s response? “He insults Barr, and dismisses Ivanka as ‘checked out.’ He clings to more fantastical theories,” the newspaper complained. The former president could have quietly kept a low profile following the bombshell hearing Thursday by the Jan. 6 House select committee investigating the insurrection. Instead, the editorial noted, “Donald Trump, the King Lear of Mar-a-Lago, decided to tweet — er, Truth — yet another statement confirming that he refuses to accept reality. ‘January 6th was not simply a protest,’ he wrote, ‘it represented the greatest movement in the history of our Country to Make America Great Again.’” It “wasn’t, of course. It was a national shame — one that neither Democrats nor Trump can stop obsessing over. It’s time for Republicans to move on,” the Post snapped back. “Meanwhile, reports that Trump was pleased that the Jan. 6 crowd chanted for Vice President Mike Pence to be hanged — a truly reprehensible sentiment — makes him unworthy for the office. Trump can’t look past 2020. Let him remain there,” the editorial concluded. Check out the full New York Post editorial.

3,Trump Keeps Whining About Jan. 6 'Unselect' Committee On Off-Brand Social Media App,politics," Reporter, HuffPost The House select committee investigating the 2021 Capitol attack held a widely viewed public hearing this week ― and on Saturday morning, it was on Donald Trump’s mind. “Why aren’t the Unselects bringing in the experts, of which there are many, to show how the Election was Rigged & Stolen?” the former president wrote in a message on his social media platform, Truth Social. (The message was posted twice, apparently by accident.) Trump did not name any of the supposed “experts,” perhaps because the U.S. legal system has repeatedly found no convincing evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, despite Trump’s claims. “The reason can only be that the ‘Committee’ knows it is unable to respond to the facts,” Trump wrote. “They would look like fools on live television. The whole Unselect Scam, just like the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA HOAX, would be exposed.” He concluded with a favorite phrase: “WITCH HUNT!” The former president had also gone on a tear Friday morning, after the Thursday evening hearing attracted some 20 million viewers. In a series of Truth Social messages, he pushed back against statements made by his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, who was shown in recorded testimony admitting that she knew former Attorney General Bill Barr had found no evidence of widespread fraud, and had accepted it as fact. Ivanka didn’t know what she was talking about, her father wrote, because she “had long since checked out” from the White House where she and her husband, Jared Kushner, served as advisers. Trump also denied that he ever voiced support for the rioters who broke into the Capitol and assaulted law enforcement while chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” as the committee’s vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), said Thursday night. The committee is expected to hold several more hearings to share what its members have found so far, having interviewed more than 1,000 people . The next hearing is set for Monday morning. Trump now posts “truths” instead of tweets because he was kicked off Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the deadly attack last year. His platform, launched earlier this year, mirrors Twitter in much of its functionality. While it billed itself as a free-speech haven unbridled by Big Tech’s content moderation standards, Truth Social has reportedly been banning users who post information from the Jan. 6 committee this week.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said.

We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer.

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,The Ideal GOP Gun Bill Is No Bill At All,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Republicans outside of the small group of senators negotiating a potential bipartisan gun control deal aren’t exactly cheering for the group to succeed. Several House Republicans told HuffPost this week that when it comes to federal law and firearms, the status quo is fine, regardless of the occasional high-profile mass shooting. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) said she doesn’t favor any new gun laws. “We don’t need any. We have one, it’s called the Second Amendment,” she said. “Murder’s already illegal.” Along similar lines, Rep. Chip Roy (Texas) said real solutions were not being talked about by Democrats. “We’re not talking about school security. We’re not talking about all the cultural nonsense that’s going on,” he said. Greene’s position was more concrete than many Republicans were willing to lay out. With attention focused on bipartisan gun negotiations in the Senate, other House Republicans took more of a wait-and-see approach, saying they wanted to evaluate what emerges from those talks before declaring if they could support any changes. As long as the Senate group is still working, it allows everyone not involved in the talks to take a step back and avoid specifics. Twelve-term House member Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who grew up steeped in gun culture, with a hobbyist father who built guns by hand, and who campaigned in 1984 for a state legislature seat in a pickup with a “God bless the NRA” sticker, was determinedly vague. “I don’t know yet. I’m not willing to disclose that yet,” he said Wednesday during House votes on a Democratic gun safety bill. “There are common-sense reforms that you could do.” Some Senate Republicans not party to the ongoing negotiations have been similarly reticent to say whether they favor specific changes. Several senators have told HuffPost they didn’t necessarily oppose the idea of raising the buying age on rifles, but they didn’t want to embrace it, either. “It’s good that members on both sides of the aisle aren’t ruling out different provisions right now,” said Sen. Todd Young (Ind.), who boasted an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association’s Political Victory Fund when he ran for Senate in 2016. “So we’ll see when they come back what has bipartisan buy-in for the package and I’ll give it very strong consideration.” The Senate negotiation is essentially an exercise in seeing if Republicans will agree to small changes in the federal background check process they would normally oppose in exchange for whatever they want on mental health and school security. House Republicans aren’t even at the table. “In the short term, I don’t think the answer is to restrict the number of good folks with guns and the right to defend themselves, and there’s a reason why nobody goes to a police station or to a gun rally and try to shoot up the place,” said Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.). “You can’t legislate evil to go away,” he said. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said he’s closely watching the Senate negotiations and set the bar high for a bipartisan approach. “I do know there’s a serious attempt to do something over there. There’s not over here. So if something gets through, particularly with a substantial margin — where it’s not 60 [votes], but it’s in the 70s — then I’m going to sit down and look,” he said. Cole acknowledged new gun restrictions face steep odds among his colleagues. “I think the majority of Republicans would probably be inclined to vote no and leave the issue to the states, but, again, let’s wait and see what they do” in the Senate, he said. That tentativeness to offer detail stood in contrast with Democratic proposals in two bills on the House floor this week. Major provisions in Wednesday’s bill and the number of GOP votes they received included: Prohibiting the purchase of semiautomatic weapons for people younger than 21 (10 votes) Tightening restrictions against “straw purchases” of guns (seven votes) Prohibiting untraceable “ghost guns” (eight votes) Requiring gun safes or secure locations if guns are stored where they could be accessed by minors (three votes) Restricting bump stocks and high-capacity gun magazines (13 votes) Thursday’s bill would have set up a federal version of state-level “red flag” laws, which would make it illegal for people deemed a risk to themselves or others to possess or obtain weapons. Though both bills passed, they are considered doomed in the Senate and each received only five votes from House Republicans ― and only one of the five is running for reelection. Not every Republican was vague. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (Fla.) touted two specific bills — one he authored, another he co-sponsored with a Democratic lawmaker — that he said could get bipartisan support if they came to the floor. “There are multiple bills that would actually have a chance to become law and, more important than that, would actually help save lives,” he said. But the bills Diaz-Balart cited are much less sweeping than the Democratic proposals. One would create a federal clearinghouse to share school safety best practices and the other would require the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center, which studies targeted violent attacks, to research school violence and offer training on school violence prevention. Asked to name a change he could support, Roy said he wanted to look at laws that would allow committing people who have mental health issues. Cole said he favored looking at mental health and guns as well as incentivizing states to pass their own red flag laws. And, when pressed, Simpson noted he had voted in the past in favor of requiring trigger locks to be sold with guns. “You look at raising the age to 21 [for buying assault weapons], that’s probably not such a big deal, since you have to be 21 to buy a handgun anyway,” he said. A waiting period of “a few extra days” because of expanded background checks for gun buyers would be inconvenient, he said, but “you could probably put up with stuff like that.” Simpson said it was still up in the air if the political environment had shifted on guns, though he added that “the feeling is it’s kind of changed.” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who voted for both House bills this week, said it was not enough to simply look at “hardening” schools and rethinking mental health and guns. “There is a legislative component — people cannot be afraid to address it,” he said. “You got to do it.” Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,It's Already 2024 In Iowa — Minus Trump,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — When the chair of the Iowa Republican Party asked Sen. Tim Scott on Thursday to “take us on a little journey of what you’re dreaming right now,” an opening for him to tease something newsy about his political future, Scott said it was a “tough” but “good” question. “President!” someone in the audience shouted. “Of my homeowners’ association?” Scott replied. Scott didn’t admit as much to Republicans who showed up to see him at a swanky country club in Iowa’s second-largest city — but, no, he wasn’t there to talk about running for president of his HOA. The South Carolina senator is one of nearly a dozen Republicans who are beginning to quietly lay the groundwork for presidential campaigns in 2024 with one major, unpredictable caveat: Donald Trump. Scott didn’t mention Trump once while headlining the GOP fundraiser this week with Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. But the former president has hinted he might run again in two years, complicating matters for loyalists like Scott who are effectively stuck in limbo until Trump makes up his mind. Those Republicans include Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. The developing 2024 field started planting seeds in Iowa back in 2021 — and in some cases earlier. Cruz is a returning favorite, having won the 2016 caucuses against Trump. Something they all seem to have in common now: None of them has a bad word — or really any words — to say about Trump, according to Jeff Kaufmann, chair of the Iowa Republican Party, which helps orchestrate the GOP’s first presidential nominating contest. “I’ve yet to have a person come in here that has even subtly hinted something negative about Trump,” Kaufmann told reporters after the Tim Scott event. “And when there are disagreements, it’s put in a way that these are disagreements of the family. I thought maybe I might have a little more of that back and forth.” Instead, the party’s dignitaries are sticking to issues like immigration and the economy that are still popular with the Republican base. “In the next election, I don’t think you will see anyone moving away from [Trump’s] policies,” Kaufmann said. “You heard Sen. Scott — he didn’t mention the president’s name, but he talked about the policies.” “I’ve yet to have a person come in here that has even subtly hinted something negative about Trump.” If there’s an opening for a ‘Never Trump’ Republican to run in 2024, it might only be a sliver, if that. The small sample size of committed GOP activists at the Scott event didn’t seem likely to embrace a Trump antagonist like Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) or Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who are both considering how to leverage their national profiles since voting to impeach Trump in 2021. “I would definitely support [Trump],” said Shelley Nelson, a retiree who was concerned about the economy and gas prices. “I would really like to see [Florida Gov.] Ron DeSantis run. He would be my No. 1 choice in 2024. But if it’s Trump, sure. I mean, I love Trump’s policies. Anybody’s personality can rub you wrong, but the policies worked great.” Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, hooked the crowd in Cedar Rapids with his inspiring life story of being raised by his grandparents following his parents’ divorce. “My grandfather spent every single morning coming to the kitchen table with me and my brother and read the newspaper cover to cover,” Scott, 56, recalled. “I always wondered what was so important in the newspaper that this man would read it every day for 30 minutes. It was about 15 years later when I learned that my grandfather actually never learned to read, but what he had learned to do was set the example for both of his grandkids to understand the power of being informed and being educated.” Scott, a senator since 2013 and a rising star in the Republican Party, previewed what might be ahead on the campaign trail: “One side wants to measure your success and your importance by how much melanin you have in your skin. I prefer to measure our success and our significance by the values we’re willing to defend.” An independent GOP adviser in the audience said that Trump’s unpredictable timing could muddy things even for well-meaning Republicans in the field. “The people who announce before him, what do they do after?” that person asked. “I think people are going to want to keep their powder dry for as long as they can to see what the field looks like,” said David Kochel, a veteran GOP strategist in Iowa. “It’s going to be the best excuse in the world for people to say, ’Thanks for calling, Sen. Cruz, but we’re not ready to make a commitment yet.’” Scott slipped out of the event early Thursday to catch a flight but promised he would be back. Haley is the next Republican on tap to headline a fundraiser for the Iowa GOP later this month. Althea Hasse, a homemaker from outside Cedar Rapids, said she liked how Scott appeared “direct and honest ... he seems like a religious guy, and we need religious people.” Ernst, who joined the Senate two years after Scott, called him “one of my best friends in the United States Senate” and “the embodiment of the American dream.” If Trump does run again, he wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the advantages of incumbency, like having the party’s early backing. “Ultimately, that question of incumbency is going to be up to the voters,” Kaufmann said. “I’ve stated very publicly that this is going to be an open, neutral playing field. “The chairman of the party will not be endorsing anyone. And, quite frankly, I hope no one on my state central committee will endorse anyone either.” Pence, who has quietly broken with Trump, was the last Republican to call Kaufmann personally, after Iowa’s primary this week. “He said he’s going to be back in the state and to keep him in mind if there’s any events that [he] can help with,” Kaufmann said. Notably, the party chair said that Trump’s people haven’t reached out yet. “All of this depends on the 700-pound elephant in the room and what he’s going to do,” Kaufmann said. “I don’t think we’re going to get significant guidance on that until after 2022.” Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That’s because, to Hogg’s surprise, Fox News on Friday printed his op-ed pleading for a stepped-up level of activism to press for legislation for increased gun safety. Fox News just published my op-edYes, this time is different. pic.twitter.com/3mMJSVY0l9 “When 17 of my classmates and teachers were murdered in my Parkland, Florida, school in 2018, a group of us desperately sought answers,” Hogg wrote in the op-ed. “How could adults have let this happen?” he asked. “In shock, we marched for our lives with a million other Americans of all stripes. There have been countless reasons to give up in the years since. You know the city names and the incidents they represent. This time the outcome must be different, and if it is, it will be because of responsible citizens.” Attitudes are “changing for what feels like the first time,” Hogg added. “Gun owners, even former gun industry executives, are demanding action because tragedies like Uvalde do not reflect their values. I know there are millions of you who want to do the right thing.” “I don’t know what the exact answer is, but I know that you should be at the table,” Hogg emphasized. “Your voice matters. Your rights matter. Your decency matters. We have disagreed in the past, but we are not enemies. Our enemy is not a party or organization, it is gun violence.” Check out the rest of Hogg’s op-ed here. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,GOP Slapped Down Again For Jan. 6 National Guard Lie,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Fact checker called out Republican leaders Friday over newly resurrected claims that President Donald Trump was not responsible for a no-show by the National Guard during the Jan. 6 insurrection last year. Trump has repeatedly blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for blocking some 10,000 members of the Guard that day. But Pelosi has no control or jurisdiction over the National Guard in the District of Columbia. Trump does. A number of media outlets, from USA Today to The Washington Post and CNN have debunked Trump’s claims that he called out the Guard and Pelosi blocked them protecting the Capitol. Trump even boasted in a videotaped statement a day after the 2021 insurrection that he “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building. GOP leaders again on Thursday blamed Pelosi for blocking the Guard. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for some reason on Thursday instead blamed Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was Senate minority leader during the insurrection. The president is in charge of the DC National Guard, with his authority delegated at the time to the Secretary of the Army. They can talk to Pelosi if they want to, but the Speaker of the House is not in a position to reject their activation decisions even if she wanted to. As the violence raged for three hours throughout the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump watched the riot on television at the White House. He did not contact anyone to protect the building or the lawmakers trapped inside. “Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) revealed Thursday night during the first hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee, “He did not call his Secretary of Defense on Jan. 6. He did not talk to his Attorney General. He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security,” Cheney added. “President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day. And he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets.” Her statements were backed up by videotaped testimony aired at the hearing from Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. He said it was then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was under siege himself at the time, to demand that the National Guard be called out. Pence told Pentagon leaders to “get the Guard down here, put down this situation,” Milley testified. The general said he later received a call from then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who told him to “kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions.” ""Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets.

14,"Ivanka Trump Backed Her Dad Even As She Knew He Lied, Ex-White House Aide Points Out",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Ivanka Trump continued to support her father even after she knew he was lying about the 2020 presidential election being “rigged,” former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham complained Friday. Ivanka Trump admitted in startling testimony, shown Thursday during the Jan. 6 House select committee hearing, that she believed former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who dismissed then-President Donald Trump’s claims that the presidential election was rigged and eventually called them “bullshit.” Barr’s conclusion on Dec. 1, 2020, that there was no evidence of any widespread election fraud “affected my perspective,” Trump’s oldest daughter, who had been a White House senior adviser, said in a video snippet of her testimony played at the hearing. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying,” she said. Ivanka Trump told the Jan. 6th Committee that she accepted former Attorney General William Barr's statement saying there was no fraud sufficient to overturn the election https://t.co/YjEvScXAAd pic.twitter.com/KxQyFkAosS Yet she never publicly contradicted her father, did “little to try to temper his false claims” and continued to travel with him while he relentlessly repeated the lies that had bolstered the Capitol rioters, The New York Times noted Thursday. It’s all “well and good that she said that she believed Bill Barr, but ... she was still traveling with her father while he pushed this big lie,” Grisham complained Friday on CNN. “If she was truly that impacted by Bill Barr, which she should have been — and I don’t know what kind of conversations she was having privately with her father — but perhaps she could have done a little bit more and not stood by his side while he publicly pushed the big lie,” Grisham added. Ivanka Trump told her colleagues to “fight” on election night even when it was clear her father was losing, the Times reported. She held on to her White House position until the very end of her father’s term. Her husband, Jared Kushner, also a White House senior adviser, continued to plot at meetings ways to overturn election results. He also complained in videotaped testimony shown at the hearing Thursday that he considered then-White House counsel Pat Cipollone’s threats to quit over the flouting of various legal issues as “whining.” Former Trump White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner tells the Jan. 6th Committee he believes repeated threats by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to resign amounted to ""whining"" https://t.co/YjEvScXAAd pic.twitter.com/1DN0ZL5FQr Donald Trump dismissed his daughter’s comments on Truth Social on Friday, saying that she didn’t know what she was talking about and was “checked out.” “Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results,” Trump messaged. “She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!).” Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results.

15,George Conway: Hard For DOJ To Ignore Liz Cheney's 'Masterful' Statements Against Trump,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) launched a “masterful prosecutorial” attack against former President Donald Trump in her address in the Jan. 6 House select committee’s first hearing, conservative attorney George Conway said Friday. Cheney’s presentation was likely “compelling” enough to convince the Department of Justice there is a “triable criminal case” against Trump for his role in the 2021 insurrection, Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He later told CNN: “I think it’s going to be hard not to” bring a case against Trump after the hearing. .@gtconway3d on first Jan 6 hearing: “This was a masterful prosecutorial presentation by Rep. Cheney…It tied together all the various strands of what Donald Trump caused, what he did, and his criminal intent established by people who worked for him.” pic.twitter.com/NSVpw8G0vU Conway also characterized Cheney’s initial address on CNN Thursday night as the “opening statement of a prosecutor — an opening statement that you could have delivered in a trial in ‘United States of America against Donald J. Trump’ for conspiracy to defraud the United States, for obstructing a congressional proceeding.” Cheney “went through all the reasons why there is substantial evidence to believe that Donald Trump intentionally committed the crime of corruptly interfering with a congressional proceeding, and of fraudulently seeking to obstruct a function of the government,” said Conway, who’s married to former Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. “And she did it with the words of people who supported him.” Watch the interview below: Conway followed up Friday on CNN with a more  detailed prediction of what a criminal case against Trump would look like. He also addressed the dramatic situation described in Thursday’s hearing of police fighting for their lives at the U.S. Capitol as Trump watched the violence he’d “fomented” on his TV in the White House and took no action to stop it for three hours. “The three hours, the three hours when he did nothing,” Conway emphasized to CNN host Brianna Keilar. “From an emotional standpoint, the contradiction, the incredible contrast between the fidelity to duty of the Capitol Police officer [Caroline Edwards] who was slipping on her colleagues’ blood, and the complete dereliction of constitutional duty by the president of the United States. It’s just a damning portrait.” Check out the full interview here: Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The $100,000 will be donated to the U.S. Capitol Police Memorial Fund. “As we saw last night in the [congressional] hearings, what happened on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was an act of domestic terrorism,” Rivera said in a statement, referring to the first public hearing on Thursday held by the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. “A group of citizens attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and as a result, lives were lost and the Capitol building was damaged,” Rivera said. He added that Del Rio apologized for his comments and that he “understands the distinction between the events of that dark day and peaceful protests, which are a hallmark of our democracy.” While the head coach acknowledged that Del Rio has the right “to voice his opinion as a citizen of the United States,” he encouraged him to be more deliberate in how he does so. “Words have consequences and his words hurt a lot of people in our community,” Rivera continued. “I want to make it clear that our organization will not tolerate any equivalency between those who demanded justice in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and the actions of those on Jan. 6 who sought to topple our government.” pic.twitter.com/86bJREVDsq Del Rio found himself on the defensive earlier this week after he dismissed last year’s violence by a pro-Donald Trump mob at the Capitol, which sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as a “dustup,” while portraying the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of Floyd as a “summer of riots, looting, burning and the destruction of personal property.” A Princeton-led study found that the overwhelming majority of BLM protests were actually quite peaceful. And when they became violent, they either involved state-sanctioned violence, such as aggressive intervention from local, state or federal authorities, or from counter-protesters from extremist groups.

2,"Carl Paladino Is A 'Straight-Up, Old-School Racist,' Says Former NY GOP Candidate",politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost In his short campaign for Congress, Buffalo, New York, businessman Carl Paladino has had to explain why he shared a conspiracy theory about mass shootings on Facebook and clarify that, no, he is not a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Now the Republican Party’s 2018 nominee for New York attorney general is out with a statement calling Paladino a “straight-up, old-school racist.” “There are many times where people have called one Republican or another a racist, and I have explained to those accusers why they were wrong,” Keith Wofford, who is Black, said in a statement Friday. “But Carl Paladino is a racist. Not ‘racially insensitive’; not ‘unsophisticated’; a straight-up, old-school racist.” Wofford, who grew up in Buffalo and is now a bankruptcy lawyer in New York City, said his conclusions are based on personal experience, from the way that Paladino treated him when he ran for attorney general. “Other Republicans, in fact, all of them that I know, were disgusted by Carl’s racism toward me, and rejected it. The people of Western New York and the Southern Tier know Carl is racist, and they deserve better,” he added. Wofford didn’t return a request for more information on his interactions with Paladino. Paladino also did not immediately return a request for comment. Paladino is running in the state’s newly redrawn 23rd District, which includes a swath of rural areas. He received a boost of support after Rep. Chris Jacobs (R-N.Y.) announced he was retiring. Jacobs is currently in the 27th District but was going to run for the 23rd. He faced intense backlash from his party, however, after announcing his support for stronger gun control laws. Paladino then quickly picked up support from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), the third-ranking House Republican, who praised him as “a job creator and conservative outsider.” Paladino, a real estate developer who ran for governor in 2010, was a strong backer of Donald Trump from the beginning. He’s essentially the Trump of Buffalo in both politics and personality. In August 2017, Paladino was kicked off the Buffalo school board for improperly disclosing private board matters. But the real outrage over his position started months earlier, in December, over racist comments he made about then-President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. The local publication Artvoice asked Paladino and other Buffalonians about their hopes for 2017. Paladino used the opportunity to call Michelle Obama a man who should live with gorillas and said he hoped Barack Obama died of mad cow disease.

3,National Review Editor Slammed For Griping About Ivanka Trump's Testimony,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Ivanka Trump’s testimony that she believed former Attorney General Bill Barr when he said the 2020 election wasn’t stolen was one of the most gripping moments of Thursday night’s Jan. 6 committee hearing. However, Rich Lowry, the editor-in-chief of the conservative National Review, dismissed its importance on Friday, saying on Twitter that the comments from former President Donald Trump’s daughter, who was also his White House adviser, were “entirely gratuitous and clearly meant simply to embarrass her.” The Ivanka Trump clip has gotten a lot of attention, but its inclusion was entirely gratuitous and clearly meant simply to embarrass her—a committee purportedly devoted to saving our democracy shouldn’t be so petty and should do better As many Twitter users pointed out, that argument quickly breaks down when you consider Ivanka Trump’s testimony clearly showed that top-ranking people in the White House didn’t believe her dad’s election fraud claims even as they kept pushing them on the American public. And when you consider that Lowry was more concerned about the former first daughter’s feelings than, say, the future of American democracy. Oh lord no, heaven forbid a senior presidential advisor who know her father was lying but just went along with it should be *embarrassed.* https://t.co/aW7vUvs3AG Is there a person who was politically & personally closer to the former president?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,politics,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

11,Ginni Thomas Asked Dozens Of Arizona Lawmakers To Overturn Biden's Win: Report,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, emailed more than two dozen state Republican lawmakers in Arizona in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a new report. In a Nov. 9, 2020, email sent to 29 state lawmakers in Arizona, Thomas urged them to ignore Joe Biden’s victory in the state and to instead “choose presidential electors” to keep President Donald Trump in power, The Washington Post reported Friday. Thomas told state lawmakers to “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure,” and to “fight back against fraud” and “ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen,” the email obtained by The Post said. Biden beat Trump in Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. The new revelation comes following a report in March that Thomas exchanged dozens of text messages with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows urging him overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. “Do not concede,” Thomas wrote Meadows on Nov. 6, 2020. “It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.” Read the full report from The Washington Post.

12,Trump Melts Down In Truth Social Rant After First Jan. 6 Hearing,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump spent Friday morning trying to spin the story of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol in a series of messages posted to his social media app, Truth Social. He specifically targeted his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, whose videotaped testimony was played in part on Thursday evening at the first public hearing of the House select committee investigating the attack. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee’s vice chair, walked viewers through sworn testimony from Trump-era Attorney General William Barr in which he dismissed Trump’s claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen as “bullshit.” Asked about Barr’s assertion, Ivanka said it “affected my perspective.” “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying,” she said in a clip aired at the hearing. The former president responded by saying his daughter didn’t know what she was talking about. “Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying Election results. She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Bar and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!),” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also bashed Barr in other messages, calling him “weak and frightened” and a “coward.” Trump was banned from Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack for refusing to stop pushing falsehoods about the 2020 election. He eventually responded by launching his own platform, which is very similar to Twitter, and now posts there in his familiar emphatic, over-capitalized style. “A one sided, totally partisan, POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” Trump wrote in another Truth Social message. Although he posted once during the hearing, calling the “Unselect Committee” a group of “political HACKS,” he saved most of his anger for Friday morning. “The so-called ‘Rush on the Capitol’ was not caused by me, it was caused by a Rigged and Stolen Election!” Trump wrote in one of eight hearing-related messages. In one of the hearing’s more astonishing moments, Cheney said that the committee had uncovered how Trump responded in the White House after learning that the mob of his supporters were chanting “hang Mike Pence” as they stormed the Capitol. A noose on a makeshift scaffold was found on the grounds of the building that afternoon. “Maybe our supporters have the right idea,” Trump said, in Cheney’s telling based on witness statements. “Mike Pence deserves it.” Trump denied this. “I NEVER said, or even thought of saying, ‘Hang Mike Pence.’ This is either a made up story by somebody looking to become a star, or FAKE NEWS!” Trump had unsuccessfully urged his vice president to overturn the results of the election by interfering with their official certification in spite of the law. The committee expects to hold several more public hearings to share what they have found so far; the next is set for Monday at 10 a.m. EST.

13,Former Fox News Editor Says He'll Testify At Next Jan. 6 Hearing,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Chris Stirewalt, a former Fox News politics editor who was fired from the network last year, will testify Monday before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Stirewalt told the “Morning in America” program on NewsNation, where he now works as political editor, that he was invited to give evidence and will do so next week. Stirewalt became the subject of abuse from former President Donald Trump’s supporters after the network was the first to declare Joe Biden the winner of Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. The journalist was fired by Fox News in January 2021 as part of what the network called a restructuring. “When I defended the call for Biden in the Arizona election, I became a target of murderous rage from consumers who were furious at not having their views confirmed,” Stirewalt wrote in an op-ed published by the Los Angeles Times later that month. “The rebellion on the populist right against the results of the 2020 election was partly a cynical, knowing effort by political operators and their hype men in the media to steal an election or at least get rich trying,” he continued. He has been a vocal critic of the network’s latest programming choices, including Tucker Carlson’s “Patriot Purge” show. Stirewalt compared Carlson’s documentary to the “garbage” shared by Alex Jones on his Infowars website. “What Fox allowed in Tucker Carlson’s documentary which said that Jan. 6 was potentially a false flag operation undertaken by the federal government and that Americans were being put in Guantanamo over pictures of waterboarding, was beyond reckless,” Stirewalt told the “Talkline” podcast with Hoppy Kercheval on West Virginia’s MetroNews in December 2021. During an interview for an Australian documentary in August 2021, the now NewsNation political editor also lamented the role of Fox News in amplifying Trump’s election lies. “Fox had the opportunity to use its position to tell the truth for the good of the country and failed to use the power and resources that it had to stand up to Donald Trump,” Stirewalt said. While it is unclear what exactly Stirewalt will testify about, Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said Monday’s 10 a.m. hearing will lay out Trump’s lies and show how those motivated the Capitol rioters. “When the committee reconvenes next week, we’re going to examine the lies that convinced those men and others to storm the Capitol to try to stop the transfer of power,” Thompson said at the end of Thursday’s hearing. “We’re going to take a close look at the first part of Trump’s attack on the rule of law when he hit the fuse that ultimately resulted in the violence of Jan. 6.” After Thursday’s hearing, Stirewalt argued former Vice President Mike Pence is emerging as a “hero in the story.” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said during the hearing that it was Pence who made efforts to deploy the National Guard on Jan. 6. “President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets,” Cheney said. “Vice President Pence did each of those things.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(Watch the videos below.) Wallace was previewing the proceedings when CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked him about the importance of the panel building its case. The moderate Wallace, now at CNN after bolting Fox News when his relationship with the right-wing network became “unsustainable,” made it clear that the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection to overthrow the 2020 election was a “dark day.” But he said it was critical that the hearing present something new for the unpersuaded and hammer home what a big deal the siege was. “I’m kind of skeptical about what we’re going to see tonight and over the next couple of weeks,” he said. Asked to elaborate, Wallace criticized the “terrible hype” used by Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who promised the panel would “blow the roof off the house” and “change history,” he said. He also expressed discomfort with how the hearings were being produced. “They have gotten the former president of ABC news Jim Goldston to produce this made-for-TV event. I think that’s a bad look both for the committee and mainstream media to seem that they’re hand-in-glove with each other.” After the hearing ended, Wallace conceded that the Jan. 6 videos shown did not lose their “capacity to shock and to disgust you and to horrify you” and called the presentation “well produced.” But for those who still deny the gravity of the revolt, “I’m not sure this or anything will change your mind.” 2/ On @CNN, Chris Wallace seems impressed by the @January6thCmte presentation but remains skeptical that hard core Trump supporters will have their minds changed …because they're insurrectionists at heart📺 pic.twitter.com/ybgBnzsB2f Wallace was hired by CNN to work on CNN+ but will now work for its main channel after the streaming arm’s quick collapse.

15,10 Notable Moments From The First Jan. 6 Prime-Time Hearing,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots held its first public hearing Thursday during prime time, providing an inside look into their investigation over the past year through testimonies and video accounts from the violence that ensued on that day. This was the first of six public hearings the bipartisan committee is planning to hold, hoping to piece together the events culminating into the attack on the U.S. Capitol and former President Donald Trump’s role in it. All three major broadcast networks aired the hearing live. The committee heard testimony Thursday from U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards and documentary filmmaker Nick Quested, who was following leaders of the Proud Boys on Jan. 6. Here are 10 notable takeaways from the hearing: The committee showed video testimony from former Attorney General William Barr recounting he told Trump his claims around election fraud were “bullshit.” Barr said he had three separate conversations with Trump on Nov. 23, 2020, Dec. 1, 2020, and Dec. 14, 2020, before he resigned as attorney general. “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president it was bullshit, and I didn’t want to be a part of it,” Barr said during his deposition. Testimony from Barr saying he told Trump it was bullshit pic.twitter.com/HPKY7Nl87c Following Joe Biden’s victory in November 2020, Barr told The Associated Press there was no proof to support claims of widespread fraud. “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Barr said at the time. Ivanka Trump, Trump’s daughter and former White House adviser, told investigators Barr’s assessment that there was no election interference “affected my perspective,” according to video aired from her testimony. “I respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he was saying,” she said. Ivanka Trump told the Jan. 6th Committee that she accepted former Attorney General William Barr's statement saying there was no fraud sufficient to overturn the election https://t.co/YjEvScXAAd pic.twitter.com/KxQyFkAosS The House panel also aired footage of testimony by Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser, saying Matt Oczkowski, Trump’s campaign internal data expert, held a call with the former president in the days following the presidential election, telling Trump he had lost, based on the reported results. “I remember he delivered to the president pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose,” Miller told the committee.

Cheney revealed Trump was angry with his advisers telling him he should be doing more to stop the riots, while he embraced calls by his supporters for then Vice President Mike Pence to be hanged for his refusal to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. “Maybe our supporters have the right idea,” Cheney recited Trump as saying, based on his advisers’ accounts. “Mike Pence deserves it.” Among the new revelations at Thursday's Jan. 6 committee hearing: Direct quotes from Donald Trump expressing approval of threats by supporters to hang Vice President Mike Pence. ""Maybe our supporters have the right idea,"" Trump said. https://t.co/vYDOCWYDid pic.twitter.com/jAWqZHDQWO Cheney added the former president did not make any efforts to send reenforcement as the Capitol was being breached, despite pleas by lawmakers, including members of his own party like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,” Cheney said. Cheney added it was Pence who made efforts to deploy the National Guard. “President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets,” Cheney said. “Vice President Pence did each of those things.” The committee released a never-before-seen video presentation of scenes before, during and after the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) introduced the montage warning the video won’t be easy to watch and includes violence. “It’s important that we remember exactly what took place. That this was no tourist visit to the Capitol,” Thompson said. The footage, which the committee obtained as part of their investigation, showed Trump supporters attacking police officers, destroying property at the Capitol and looking for members of Congress to attack. At the end of the video, the House panel included an audio except from a Fox News interview with Trump on July 11, 2021, drawing contrast between the gruesome scenes and Trump’s assertions that the event was a peaceful protest. “They were peaceful people,” Trump said. “These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love, the love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it.” Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who was working at the Capitol during the attacks of Jan. 6, teared up while watching footage of the riots during the hearing. Dunn was sitting alongside the girlfriend of the late Officer Brian Sicknick, left, and fellow Capitol police officer, Aquilino Gonell, on the right. Dunn told The Wall Street Journal it was hard watching video from the attacks. “It was painful. It was difficult. It was very emotional,” Dunn said. Dunn though still plans to attend all of the future Jan. 6 committee hearings. “It’s only right that we seek accountability and justice for you know, some of our officers are no longer with us because of that day,” Dunn told the Journal.

The committee aired testimony of Jeremy Bertino, who the panel lists as a Proud Boy, saying the street gang’s membership grew “exponentially” following Trump calling on them to “stand back and standby” during a presidential debate in 2020. ″I’d say tripled probably,” Bertino told investigators. an investigator for the January 6 committee says Trump's request that the Proud Boys ""stand by"" during a presidential debate led to a spike in membership for the group pic.twitter.com/2kLQDNFt9L Trump made the reference to Proud Boys in response to a question by debate moderator Chris Wallace in Sept. 29, 2020, about whether Trump would condemn white supremacists and militia groups. “Proud boys stand back and standby,” Trump said. “But I’ll tell you what: somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem.” “This is a left-wing problem,” Trump continued. Edwards, the first U.S. Capitol police officer to be injured during the Capitol riots, painted the scene on Jan. 6, 2021, as an “absolute war zone” during her testimony before the House panel Thursday. “I just remember that moment of stepping behind the line and seeing the absolute war zone that the west front [of the Capitol] had become,” said Edwards, who sustained a concussion during the attack. Edwards also spoke about the injuries other officers suffered during the insurrection. ″[Officers] were bleeding, they were throwing up... I saw friends with blood all over their faces, I was slipping in people’s blood,” Edwards said. “I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage, it was chaos. I can’t even describe what I saw.

Eric Barber, who was charged with theft and unlawful demonstration in the Capitol, said Trump “personally” asked them to come to Washington D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021. “I thought for everything he’s done for us, if this is the only thing he’s going to ask of me, I’ll do it,” Barber said, according to audio sourced by the Department of Justice.

16,This Is What Republicans Were Talking About During The Jan. 6 Committee Hearing,politics," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost As members of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol laid out its horrific findings on prime-time television Thursday night, many Republicans wanted to talk about literally anything else. While police officers testified about risking their lives to protect members of Congress, many of those same lawmakers were tweeting disparaging or totally unrelated things to distract from the proceedings. Ten minutes before the hearings began, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted about Democrats “ignoring America’s crime crisis” — apparently forgetting that hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters have been charged with crimes related to that day. Along with that, McCarthy shared a crude two-hour video of graphic violence, spliced with text saying things like “The Democrat Party is for the breakdown of society.” As the hearing was underway, the GOP leader retweeted a member complaining about Democrats not voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s fascinating to see Democrats pack into a full committee room even though many of them used proxy voting as an excuse not to show up to work for the past 2 years,” Rep. Fred Keller (R-Pa.) wrote at 8:20 p.m. EDT — as committee vice chair, Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), laid out how Donald Trump “oversaw and coordinated a sophisticated seven-part plan to overturn the presidential election and prevent the transfer of presidential power.” It’s fascinating to see Democrats pack into a full committee room even though many of them used proxy voting as an excuse not to show up to work for the past 2 years. At 8:43 p.m., the official Twitter account of the Republican Party tweeted: “Joe Biden hasn’t had a press interview in 121 days.” Joe Biden hasn’t had a press interview in 121 days. At 9:15, the No. 3 House Republican, Elise Stefanik of New York, appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program “to set the record straight on [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi’s partisan sham witch hunt.” That came as the select committee swore in Officer Caroline Edwards, who went on to describe a “war scene” at the Capitol: “There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people’s blood,” said Edwards, who suffered a brain injury in the Jan. 6 riot. Around the same time, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) wrote: “The partisan January 6 committee is nothing more than an illegitimate show trial.” The partisan January 6 committee is nothing more than an illegitimate show trial. pic.twitter.com/tkfshvUGyq At 9:36 p.m., the Republicans of the House Judiciary Committee tweeted, “Still reading off teleprompter,” an apparent reference to committee chair Bennie Thompson (R-Miss.), who had been speaking at the time. Still reading off teleprompter. On the House floor Thursday, far-right Republicans said Democrats used the hearing to distract from real-world problems afflicting Americans. “They don’t want you talking about the size of the pack of tortillas that I just bought last week before I came out ― they used to look like the regular corn tortillas, now they look like mini tortillas,” Biggs said. “Same price, the same packaging.” They also suggested Pelosi (D-Calif.) deliberately left the Capitol vulnerable to attack on Jan. 6, 2021. And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) complained the Capitol rioters were being treated as “political prisoners of war” and repeated her insinuation that the entire attack was a setup by the FBI. Separately, Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) announced that if Republicans retake the House, they will launch an investigation into the Jan. 6 committee itself. McCarthy, for his part, repeated his incredible claim that “everybody in the country” bore responsibility for what happened at the Capitol that day.

1,Tucker Carlson Throws Prime-Time Tantrum During Jan. 6 Committee Hearing,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson opened his Fox News show on Thursday evening by making it clear that neither he nor Fox News — unlike every other major news channel — would be broadcasting the prime-time, historic House select committee hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The hearing, Carlson intoned, was “deranged” and “insulting,” and he simply refused to “play along.” “This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live,” Carlson said, comparing the hearing to the stuff you might see in “totalitarian regimes.” “They are lying, and we will not let them do it.” And so, as the House committee broadcast previously unseen footage of the shocking violence by a mob of Donald Trump supporters on Jan. 6 for all the country to see, Carlson instead broadcast panned-out shots of members of Congress watching the footage. He and his producers plastered hysterical chyrons across the screen for their millions of viewers to see: “JAN 6 CMTE FUELS FALSE NARRATIVES AS SHAM INVESTIGATION DRAGS ON.” “LEADERS WILL SPEND 90 MINUTES GIVING MORAL LECTURE.” “OUR LEADERS ARE FOCUSING ON JAN. 6 WHILE IGNORING THE REAL THREATS.” Tucker Carlson's opening salvo: ""It tells you a lot about the priorities of our ruling class that the rest of us are getting yet another lecture about January 6 tonight – from our moral inferiors, no less."" He says ""they are lying and we are not going to help them do it."" pic.twitter.com/tbxhWcnEPT Carlson also welcomed a murderer’s row of his favorite guests, including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), right-wing pundit Michael Tracey and Darren Beattie, a onetime speechwriter for former President Donald Trump who was kicked out of the White House for speaking at a white supremacist conference. Beattie was one of the main talking heads for “Patriot Purge,” Carlson’s conspiratorial docuseries about Jan. 6 on Fox Nation. Carlson used his prime-time hour Thursday to recapitulate the wild revisionist history of Jan. 6 he pushed in “Patriot Purge”: that the violence of the attack on the Capitol was actually stirred up by the FBI as a pretext to arrest Trump supporters en masse. Carlson also tried to compare the Jan. 6 attack to the anti-racist uprisings of 2020, a false equivalence his guests lapped up with glee. “When the political violence benefits them, they turn a blind eye toward it,” said American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp. “When real Americans have outrage, they want to put them in jail.” (Schlapp did not explain what constituted a “real American.”) Fox News did not break for a commercial for the whole hour of Carlson’s show. “Carlson went the whole hour without a break,” tweeted Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, the liberal media watchdog. “Fox is desperate to keep its viewers from switching to another channel and seeing the hearing in real time.” “Fox News isn’t just letting Tucker Carlson do his regular show, they’re airing it without commercials,” Gertz added. “They want to push his propaganda so much that they are leaving money on the table to do it.” At one point in his show, Carlson, while arguing that what happened on Jan. 6 was not an insurrection, seemed to threaten another insurrection. “This was not an insurrection,” he said of the attack to try to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 Electoral College vote, “but you know what will give you an insurrection? If you ignore legitimate concerns of a population. If you brush them aside like they don’t matter when gas goes to $5 and say ‘Buy an electric car.’ When cities become so filthy and dangerous that you can’t live there. When the economy becomes so distorted your children have no hope of getting married and giving you grandchildren. When you don’t care at all about any of that and all you do is talk about yourself, nonstop, you might get an insurrection if you behave like that, speaking of insurrections.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, said he dismissed Cipollone’s threats as “whining,” indicating how little Trump’s inner circle cared about the legal advice they were receiving. “I know he was always ― him and the team were always saying, ‘Oh, we’re going to resign. We’re not going to be here if this happens, if that happens,’” Kushner said. “So I kind of took it up to be just whining, to be honest with you.” Former Trump White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner tells the Jan. 6th Committee he believes repeated threats by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to resign amounted to ""whining"" https://t.co/YjEvScXAAd pic.twitter.com/1DN0ZL5FQr The revelation came Thursday night from Rep.

Just days before the attempted coup, Cipollone and his deputy threatened to quit if Trump went through with his plan to install a loyalist as acting attorney general who would pursue Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Cipollone ― who defended the president during his impeachment trial in 2019 ― reportedly considered resigning several times after the election, as he tried to convince Trump to more forcefully condemn his supporters who had attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. He also argued that Trump was wrong in believing that Vice President Mike Pence had the power to stop the certification of the Electoral College votes.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), vice chair of the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, said the committee will provide proof that multiple Republican Congressmen sought pardons from former President Donald Trump after Jan. 6. During Thursday’s prime time hearing, Cheney said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) contacted the White House in the weeks after Jan. 6 to seek a presidential pardon. She said multiple other Congressmen sought “pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.” Perry denied Cheney’s claim in a tweet Friday, calling it an “absolute, shameless, and soulless lie.” The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie. Politico reported in May the committee sent a letter to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) requesting testimony about the insurrection, and claimed multiple House Republicans sought pardons “for activities taken in connection with President Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.” In January, Trump said he would pardon people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 riots, claiming “they are being treated so unfairly.” Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), a member of the Jan. 6 committee, argued Trump was “absolutely” tampering with witnesses by making the comments. According to Politico, in the last days of his presidency, Trump had considered a blanket pardon for those charged in connection with the insurrection.

Mike Pence deserves it.” Trump supporters built a makeshift gallows on the west side of the Capitol during the riot and chanted for Pence to be hanged for refusing to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The New York Times reported last month that at least one witness told the Jan. 6 committee they’d heard about Trump’s comment via former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and that a former Meadows aide who was present at the time confirmed it. Trump on Friday claimed he “never said, or thought of saying, ‘Hang Mike Pence.’” In a post on his social media website, the former president called it a “made up story by somebody looking to become a star.” Cheney also said that the committee will air testimony that Trump “really did not want to put anything out” by urging his supporters to stand down and leave the Capitol, and that the former president was “really angry” at advisors who said he needed to do so. “On the morning of Jan. 6, President Donald Trump’s intention was to remain president of the United States,” Cheney said, adding that he had “a seven-point plan” to overturn the 2020 election. Cheney said Trump made “relentless efforts to pressure Pence both in private and public.” “What President Trump asked Vice President Pence to do wasn’t just wrong. It was illegal and unconstitutional,” she added. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Jan. 6 Hearing Opens With Trump's AG William Barr Calling Stolen Election Claim 'Bullshit',politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s own attorney general told the then-president that his claims of a “stolen” election were “bullshit,” according to videotaped testimony revealed Thursday night at the House Jan. 6 select committee’s first public hearing. “I told the president it was bullshit, and I didn’t want to be a part of it,” Barr told committee investigators during his deposition. Committee chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in his opening remarks that the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol was the culmination of a “conspiracy” to hold on to power. “Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup. The violence was no accident.” The two-hour presentation recapped a year’s worth of investigative work by the committee, tying together numerous strands that have been known to the public into a story as well as offering nuggets of new information. Vice chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said in her opening remarks that Americans would hear how Trump resisted calls by his own staff to take action as the violent unfolded on his television screen. “You will hear testimony that, ‘The president did not really want to put anything out calling off the riot or asking his supporters to leave.’ You will hear that President Trump was yelling and ‘really angry’ at advisers who told him he needed to be doing something more,” she said. “And aware of the rioters’ chants to hang [Vice President] Mike Pence, the president responded with this sentiment, ‘Maybe our supporters have the right idea.’ Mike Pence ‘deserves it,’” Cheney added. She also offered a preview of the coming hearings. Monday’s hearing will lay out evidence of how early Trump knew, his lies notwithstanding, that he had actually lost the election, using testimony from his own campaign staff. The third hearing, set for Wednesday, will showcase Trump’s attempt to fire the acting attorney general who refused to help him overturn the election and replace him with an official who would. Cheney said they would hear evidence of how Trump allies in the House, including Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, requested Trump for pardons before he left office. “Multiple other Republican congressmen also sought presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election,” she said. Subsequent hearings would cover Trump’s attempt to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to declare Trump the winner during the certification ceremony; Trump’s fake elector scheme to generate pro-Trump slates in states he had actually lost; and finally Trump’s work to summon his mob for the express purpose of attacking the Capitol to pressure Pence and lawmakers to do as he wanted. “The attack on our Capitol was not a spontaneous mob,” she said. The committee also began linking the actual breach of the Capitol to encouragement by Trump, starting with his statement during one of the 2020 presidential debates: “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.” A video by committee investigator Marcus Childress said membership in the group tripled after Trump’s statement, and that when Trump told his followers to come to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, the Proud Boys saw in it more than just encouragement. “The extremists, they took it a step further. They took it as a call to arms,” Childress said. U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, who suffered a brain injury when she became the first officer injured in the attack, said the west front of the Capitol was turned into a “war zone,” something she thought she would never see. “I’m not combat trained. That day, it was just hours of hand-to-hand combat. I saw my friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people’s blood.” Many of the details in the presentation had been reported over the previous months, but some information has never been disclosed publicly. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, for example, told investigators that while Mike Pence spoke to him multiple times to demand the deployment of troops to the Capitol, Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows had a different concern. “We have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions. We need to establish the narrative ... that the president is still in charge and that things are steady,” Milley said he told him. Thursday’s prime-time hearing, carried live by all three major broadcast networks, is the first of a half dozen sessions the committee plans to hold before the end of the month. Committee members hope to show Americans how Trump was at the center of a scheme to remain in power despite having lost reelection. Trump and his allies spent the days leading up to the hearing trying to delegitimize it by calling it partisan — even though it has two GOP members, including Cheney — and saying it’s out to get him. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who, according to newly released audio, favored a committee to investigate Jan. 6 before he spoke extensively to Trump and changed his mind, said at a Thursday morning news conference: “It is the most political and least legitimate committee in American history.” And Trump himself, in a series of posts on his own social media platform, repeated his lie that the 2020 election had been “rigged” and “stolen” from him, and he insulted what he called the “unselect” committee. President Joe Biden, who called on Trump’s mob to disperse on Jan. 6 and called on Trump to ask them to do so, praised the hearing while appearing at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. “A lot of Americans are going to see for the first time some of the details,” he said. The committee has been working for nearly a year, having interviewed and taken depositions from more than 1,000 witnesses and collected 140,000 pages of documents. It will expire with this Congress and, if Republicans win control of the chamber as expected, will almost certainly not be renewed. It was created when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to move ahead with a “select” committee after Republicans blocked a resolution to create an independent commission, similar to what was done after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. She then nixed McCarthy’s attempt to place election-result denying Trump supporters like Ohio’s Jim Jordan on the committee, which led to McCarthy pulling all of his selections. Pelosi responded by appointing two Republicans to the committee: Illinois’s Adam Kinzinger and, as vice chair, Cheney. Both were among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 attack, and both have been vocal critics of other Republicans who downplay the seriousness of that day or claim that Trump had not done anything wrong. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― led to the deaths of five people, including one police officer, the injury of 140 more officers and four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.

14,Kevin McCarthy Blames 'Everybody In The Country' For Jan. 6 Attack,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost According to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), former President Donald Trump bears some responsibility for an attack on the U.S. Capitol ― along with everybody else in the country. During a news conference ahead of Thursday’s hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, McCarthy was asked if he still believed Trump bore some responsibility for the attack. “Look, I’ve answered that many times. I thought everybody in the country [bore] some responsibility, based upon what has been going on,” McCarthy said, echoing remarks he’s made in the past. “The riots on the streets, the others.” In the weeks after the Capitol riot, the Republican leader said both publicly and privately that Trump was responsible. “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,” McCarthy said on the House floor on Jan. 13, 2021. “He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.” Privately, his assessment was even harsher. In a leaked audio recording from Jan. 11, 2021, McCarthy said Trump “bears responsibility for his words and actions. No ifs, ands or buts.” In another recording, he said what Trump did on Jan. 6 was “unacceptable” and that “nobody can defend that, and nobody should defend it.” But within a couple of weeks, he pivoted to doing just that. By Jan. 21, McCarthy was arguing that Trump never provoked the mob that laid siege to the Capitol, and offered his first iteration of this week’s comment. “I also think everybody across this country has some responsibility,” he said in an interview at the time. His “riots on the streets” comment Thursday was an apparent reference to the nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police violence against people of color, following the repeated police killings of Black Americans. Many Republicans have compared or conflated that unrest with the violence on Jan. 6, when a mob of Trump supporters, spurred on by his lies about the 2020 election, attacked law enforcement and stormed Congress in an attempt to stop the certification of the results and keep Trump in power.

15,Ryan Zinke’s Primary Struggles Thrust Montana Into Midterm Spotlight,politics," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Ryan Zinke seemingly had it all: President Donald Trump’s “full endorsement,” name recognition and political clout at home, and lots and lots of campaign cash. The former Navy SEAL, congressman and Trump administration interior secretary was widely expected to cruise to victory in the Republican primary for Montana’s new House seat on Tuesday. Instead he floundered, barely eking out a win over Al Olszewski, a former state senator and hard-line conservative who painted Zinke as a self-serving liberal who “quit” Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Zinke late Thursday after a delay in Lincoln Country. Zinke defeated Olszewski by just over 1,600 votes, or 1.9 percentage points. In a statement, Zinke thanked voters for their “confidence that America can be fixed and for ignoring the political BS.” Zinke’s unimpressive performance sets the stage for what could prove to be a competitive midterm race as Republicans look to regain the majority in the House. “Logic would say the District 1 seat may be more in play during the general election,” said Chuck Johnson, a retired journalist who covered Montana politics for more than four decades. “It likely will be one of the most-watched House races nationally.” But Johnson stressed there are many factors — campaign messaging and tactics, fundraising and dark-money influence, and the extent to which national party committees get involved, if at all — that will determine just how tight things get. Montana’s new House district, which covers the western part of the state, was created last year to account for population growth in Big Sky Country. It is the first time Montana has had two House seats since 1993. When western Montanans head to the polls in November, they will be faced with two very different choices. Zinke, the muscle of Trump’s fossil fuel-centric “energy dominance” agenda who has made a small fortune consulting for oil, gas and mining interests since resigning under a cloud of scandal in early 2019, will square off against Monica Tranel, a rancher, two-time Olympic rower and environmental lawyer who successfully helped sue Northwest Energy over a 2007 Montana law that gave the utility giant pre-approval to construct energy projects. Tranel trounced the Democratic field on Tuesday — a race that many longtime political observers in Montana expected to be the more competitive of the primaries. In a statement after her win, Tranel took a swing at her expected GOP opponent, saying that Democrats and Republicans alike made clear on Tuesday that “they want a representative in Congress to represent them, rather than corporations that exploit them.” “Ryan Zinke had multiple chances to show up for Montanans, but instead of serving Montana, he served himself,” she said. “Zinke’s record of corruption has contributed to a primary result that shows his own party does not trust him.” Zinke was one of five candidates on the Republican ticket Tuesday. He campaigned as if he was a shoo-in for the Republican nomination, given his Trump credentials and previous stint as Montana’s at-large House member. He largely avoided talking to the press, with the exception of right-wing outlets, and did not show up for a single primary candidate forum, including one last month in his hometown of Whitefish. Through mid-May, he had raised nearly $3 million, far more than any other candidate in the race, and outspent everyone in the field by 2-to-1 or more. In the end, nearly 60% of Republican voters ultimately cast their ballot for someone other than Zinke. Many of those votes will be up for grabs in November. Even more notable, Zinke got walloped in his home county of Flathead, tallying just 31.5% of the vote to Olszewski’s 47.8%, according to the latest returns. “He is wounded, for sure. He’s vulnerable,” said Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign. “I think that, obviously, the positives that come with being a high-level person in the Trump administration appear to be offset by the negatives that come with the ethical lapses that have been widely publicized.” There are signs that Zinke’s camp knew it might be in trouble. In March and April, his campaign paid a public opinion research firm more than $50,000 to conduct voter surveys, expenditures show. And in the three days before the primary, western Montana voters received text messages that attacked Olszewski as “the wrong choice for Montana Conservatives,” according to copies of the texts a Montana resident shared with HuffPost. One of the texts included a pre-recorded voice memo from Donald Trump Jr. “There’s a better choice,” Trump Jr. said in the recording. “Republican Ryan Zinke is the true conservative Montanans can trust. That’s why my father, President Donald Trump, endorsed Ryan Zinke, because he’s the right choice for Congress.” The text message ads were paid for by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC with ties to both Zinke and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). Daines also endorsed Zinke in the Montana House race. William Foley — the billionaire founder and chair of title insurance company Fidelity National Financial and owner of the Vegas Golden Knights, an NHL franchise — is one of More Jobs, Less Government PAC’s largest funders. He gave the PAC $300,000 during the 2020 election cycle. That year, the PAC spent $895,000 opposing Daines’ challenger, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Foley, his wife and other Fidelity National employees have so far donated a combined $27,450 to Zinke’s current congressional bid, Federal Election Commission records show. That’s on top of the nearly $200,000 that employees and political action committees affiliated with the company reportedly contributed to Zinke’s previous two congressional campaigns. Zinke is best known as a face of Trump-era swampiness and corruption. He played an outsize role in advancing the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel, anti-environmental agenda and racked up nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions. One of those probes targeted his use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense, including when he and staffers chartered an oil company plane for a flight from Las Vegas to Montana. That flight, which cost more than $12,000, followed a “motivational speech” Zinke gave to the Vegas Golden Knights. The scandals ultimately caught up with him, and he resigned as interior chief in January 2019 — one day before Democrats took control of the House and the oversight authority that comes with it. Zinke has repeatedly dismissed the internal probes against him as “politically motivated attacks” and falsely claimed that he was cleared of all wrongdoing. And on the campaign trail in recent months, he all but promised to get revenge if elected and if Republicans take back the majority in the House of Representatives in November. “I think we need to hold people accountable, particularly in the Biden administration. It seems there is a lot there between Hunter Biden and the president himself,” Zinke told right-wing outlet Newsmax earlier this week. “I think we need to investigate some egregious acts, but I would say be [judicious] in our investigation and not abuse the power ... Just because the other team lies, cheats and steals, we should not bow to that bait.” Interior’s internal watchdog concluded in a report in February that Zinke had violated ethics rules and misused his office through his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and then lied to investigators about it. Following his departure from the Trump administration, Zinke cashed in with the fossil fuel interests he’d spent two years regulating. A financial disclosure his campaign filed in November, months after it was due, revealed that Zinke was paid a combined $1.36 million for consulting and other services in the two years after leaving the Trump administration. That included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from U.S. Gold Corp. and at least $5,000 each from several other fossil fuel interests. A good chunk of that income flowed in while Zinke was on the campaign trail railing against President Joe Biden for high gas prices, peddling industry talking points and touting his energy bona fides. Zinke’s industry ties, ethical shortfalls and ties to California — Politico reported last month that his wife designated a home she inherited in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence — took center stage in the primary. In a campaign ad released late last month, Olszewski highlighted several of Zinke’s scandals while at the Interior Department and declared that “flying high on the taxpayer dime isn’t cowboy, it’s California.” Those same issues will no doubt be fodder for attack ads in the coming months. As HuffPost reported this week, in the course of Zinke’s 14-year political career, he has shifted from a moderate, conservation-minded Republican to a hard-line conservative handcuffed to Trumpian ideology. When Newsmax asked Zinke earlier this month about the importance of Trump’s endorsement, he said the former president is “either going to be a king or a kingmaker.” And he dismissed Olszewski’s claim that he’s too liberal to represent Montana. “I don’t think President Trump endorses RINOs,” he said, referring to so-called “Republicans in name only.” Zinke still heads into the general election as the favorite. More than 26,000 more votes were cast in the Republican primary than in the Democratic primary for the western district. FiveThirtyEight.com gave Republicans a 10-point advantage to win the seat in November. In 2020, Trump won Montana by 16 points and Democrats lost every single statewide race. But Zinke’s primary performance has clearly energized Montana Democrats. “While Democrats are united around Monica Tranel and already gearing up for November, the Republicans start the race off in disarray,” Shelia Hogan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said in a statement Wednesday when the race was still too close to call. Jayson O’Neill, a conservation consultant and former aide to former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, said the primary revealed a schism among Republican voters in western Montana. He expects the results this week could bump the race to one of the top House battles of the midterms. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee maintains a “Districts in Play” list; Montana’s new House district is not currently on it, but some anticipate the committee could come to see the new Montana House seat as an opportunity. “It’s a big referendum that says people are fed up with Zinke, and they are willing to vote for pretty much anybody else,” O’Neil said.

16,Latino Lawmakers Want A National Park Honoring César Chávez And Farmworkers,politics," Reporter, HuffPost California Democrats Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Raul Ruiz want the U.S. to create a national park dedicated to labor rights icon César Chávez and the farmworker movement. On Thursday, the lawmakers introduced a bill to preserve several sites in California and Arizona as the César E. Chávez and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park. The park would include the César E. Chávez National Monument in Keene, California, as well as designate as a National Historic Trail the over 300-mile route which farm workers marched from Delano to Sacramento calling for the state to allow them to unionize. Establishing this park would “pay proper homage to a Latino icon and civil rights leader who fought tirelessly for the dignity, respect and equal treatment of farmworkers and to the movement he created that carries on today,” Padilla said in a news release. TODAY: @RepRaulRuizMD @AlexPadilla4CA introduced a bill to commemorate the life and work of Cesar E. Chavez with a new national historical park. The bill is a result of 10+ years of work by community advocates, members of Congress, and orgs including NPCA. https://t.co/8JiF9gImVE Chávez, who was born in Arizona in 1927 to farm worker parents, moved to California as a child and worked the fields with his family. In the 1960s, he co-founded the United Farm Workers movement with fellow labor activist Dolores Huerta. They fought for migrant farm workers to have better pay and working conditions, organizing grape workers to strike and launch a nationwide boycott. These efforts led to some of the nation’s first union contracts for farmworkers. United Farm Workers pushed for policy changes that led to the 1975 passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in California, which granted farmworkers in the state the right to bargain collectively as part of a union. To this day, United Farm Workers continues to fight for the rights of migrant agricultural laborers, who work the fields under tough conditions for little pay, including under extreme heat amid the climate crisis. Padilla’s office noted in its release that “too few national park units primarily focus on women, communities of color, or other historically marginalized groups.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Geico Might Have To Pay Woman Who Got HPV After Sex In Insured Car,politics," KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Geico could be required to pay a Missouri woman $5.2 million because she said she contracted a sexually transmitted disease while having sex in the car of a man who is insured by the company. A three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a Jackson County Court’s decision affirming an arbitrator’s finding that the woman was entitled to the award. However, Maryland-based Geico has filed a federal lawsuit arguing the woman’s claim is not covered by the man’s insurance policy. The company said in an email Thursday that lawsuit will determine whether “there is coverage in this matter.” According to court documents, the woman, identified as M.O., and a man, who were in a relationship, had sex in the man’s car. She contends she contracted HPV, human papillomavirus, because the man did not tell her he had the disease. HPV can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. In February 2021, M.O. notified Geico she planned to seek a $1 million insurance settlement against the man. She argued the man’s auto insurance provided coverage for her injuries and losses. The insurance company refused the settlement offer, saying the woman’s claim did not occur because of normal use of the vehicle, according to court documents. An arbitrator eventually determined she should be awarded $5.2 million for damages and her injuries. She then filed a motion in Jackson County Court seeking to confirm the award. Geico claimed it did not know the man and woman had entered into arbitration and, when it found out, it sought to intervene in the court case. The company argued the arbitration award was reached through collusion and fraud, violated its rights to due process and was unenforceable. The lower court rejected Geico’s requests and confirmed the award, prompting the insurance company’s appeal because it said it did not have a “meaningful opportunity” to defend its interests, according to court documents. The appeals court found that Geico did not have the right to “re-litigate” the issues after the award had been affirmed. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Lawsuit Alleges LA Shelter For Kids Was Rife With Sexual Abuse,politics," LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Los Angeles County-run shelter meant to be a safe space for children as they awaited placement in foster homes was for decades a den for sexual predators among the staff — and some residents — who preyed on children as young as 5, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday by dozens of former residents. Some of the more than 30 plaintiffs spoke at a news conference and wept and trembled as they detailed abuse and some victims’ attempts to escape the hall’s barbed-wire fences and guarded gates. Among the victims was a 6-year-old boy who in 1990 was molested by a male staffer who locked the boy in a closet as punishment for screaming during the assault, according to the lawsuit. Jonathan Wright, 39, held up the T-shirt he was given when he first went to MacLaren Children’s Center in El Monte as an 8-year-old. He said he was sexually abused by a physician there. “To this day, I hate being near doctors,” he said, sobbing. Staff members often turned a blind eye to the assaults and misconduct at the facility, where children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs, the lawsuit said. (Editor’s note: This story includes discussion of sexual violence. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.) The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they give their permission. Octavia Evans said she was 12 when she was abused. She summoned the courage to report it to staff and said they took it to their boss — who was her abuser. Now 36, Evans addressed any former MacLaren staff members who may have watched the news conference: “We were children, and we were trusting you to care for us — not hurt us.” The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages. It’s the second to be brought recently against the county in connection with the alleged sexual abuse of foster children at the facility, also known as MacLaren Hall. The victims’ attorneys say they have more than 200 clients who claim they were abused at the facility. The lawsuit says that county officials in and out of the hall either knew or should have known of the abuse and failed to act. “MacLaren Hall became a dumping-grounds for society’s most vulnerable, including minors without parents, or minors whose parents who were unable to care for them,” the lawsuit said. “Children were frequently removed from abusive homes and placed at MacLaren Hall only to be re-abused.” The facility opened in 1961 and was overseen by the county’s probation department and then in 1976 was placed under the purview of the county Department of Children and Family Services. More than 20,000 kids passed through the hall before it closed in 2003. A lawsuit was filed in May by eight women and four men, including one who was 5 in 1988 when he says he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom. Children and Family Services issued a statement declining to comment on the lawsuit but said the allegations “will be thoroughly examined.” “Our department has many safeguards in place to protect children in our care and to hold accountable those who violate laws and policies,” the statement said. MacLaren was shuttered in 2003 after the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California and other organizations filed class-action lawsuits alleging inhumane treatment by staff and a failure to investigate abuse reports. An ACLU report described conditions as “Dickensian,” with children who were so neglected it amounted to “government sponsored child abuse.” Los Angeles County settled the lawsuit with the ACLU and has paid settlements to some victims. MacLaren failed to conduct background checks on staff prior to 2001. Once the checks were implemented, 17 staffers were found to have criminal histories that should have disqualified them from being hired, attorney Adam P. Slater said. “It was medieval in the way it was run. ... MacLaren Hall had more in common with a child prison” than a safe place for children, Slater said. The plaintiffs were able to file lawsuits because of a California law that took effect in 2020 and suspended for three years the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases. The statute of limitations in California for filing certain felony sexual abuse charges runs out when a child victim turns 40. The sheriff’s department — which polices county facilities — and the district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether law enforcement has initiated any criminal investigations on behalf of MacLaren victims. The victims’ attorneys say they are not aware of a criminal investigation involving MacLaren since the mid-1980s, when five employees were arrested on suspicion of child molestation and selling drugs to children, according to the lawsuit.

3,"Capitol Riot Hearings Opening, Focused On Extremists, Trump",politics," Watch the prime-time House hearings on the Jan. 6 attack LIVE above. WASHINGTON (AP) — With never-seen video, new audio and a mass of evidence, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol will attempt to show the “harrowing story” of the deadly violence that erupted that day and also a chilling backstory as the defeated president, Donald Trump, tried to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory. Thursday’s prime-time hearing will open with eyewitness testimony from the first police officer pummeled in the mob riot and from a documentary filmmaker tracking the extremist Proud Boys, who prepared to fight for Trump immediately after the election and led the storming of the Capitol. It will also feature the committee’s accounts from Trump’s aides and family members, interviewed behind closed doors, of the deadly siege that Democrats and others say put U.S. democracy at risk. “When you hear and understand the wide-reaching conspiracy and the effort to try to corrupt every lever and agency of government involved in this, you know, the hair on the back of your neck should stand up,” Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., a member of the 1/6 committee, said in an interview. The 1/6 panel’s yearlong investigation will begin to show how America’s tradition of a peaceful transfer of presidential power came close to slipping away. It will reconstruct how Trump refused to concede the 2020 election, spread false claims of voter fraud and orchestrated an unprecedented public and private campaign to overturn Biden’s victory. Biden, in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas, said many viewers “are going to be seeing for the first time a lot of the detail that occurred.” “I think it was a clear, flagrant violation of the Constitution,” he said. Trump, unapologetic, dismissed the investigation anew — and even declared on social media that Jan. 6 “represented the greatest movement in the history of our country.” The result of the coming weeks of public hearings may not change hearts or minds in politically polarized America. But the committee’s investigation with 1,000 interviews is intended to stand as a public record for history. A final report aims to provide an accounting of the most violent attack on the Capitol since the British set fire to it in 1814, and to ensure such an attack never happens again. The riot left more than 100 police officers injured, many beaten and bloodied, as the crowd of pro-Trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the Capitol. At least nine people who were there died during and after the rioting, including a woman who was shot and killed by police. Emotions are still raw at the Capitol, and security will be tight for the hearings. Law enforcement officials are reporting a spike in violent threats against members of Congress. Against this backdrop, the committee will speak to a divided America, ahead of the fall midterm elections when voters decide which party controls Congress. Most TV networks will carry the hearings live, but Fox News Channel will not. The committee chairman, civil rights leader Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, will set the tone with opening remarks. The two congressional leaders will outline what the committee has learned about the events leading up to that brisk January day when Trump sent his supporters to Congress to “fight like hell” for his presidency as lawmakers undertook the typically routine job of certifying the previous November’s results. “People are going to have to follow two intersecting streams of events — one will be the attempt to overturn the presidential election, that’s a harrowing story in itself,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the committee, said in an interview. “The other will be the sequence of events leading up to a violent mob attack on the Capitol to stop the counting of Electoral College votes and block the peaceful balance of power,” he said. One witness scheduled Thursday was documentary maker Nick Quested, who filmed the Proud Boys storming the Capitol — along with a pivotal meeting between the group’s then-chairman Henry “Enrique” Tarrio and another extremist group, the Oath Keepers, the night before in nearby parking garage. Court documents show that members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were discussing as early as November a need to fight to keep Trump in office. Leaders both groups and some members have since been indicted on rare sedition charges over the military-style attack. Along with the eyewitness testimony, the panel will unveil multimedia presentations, including previously unreleased video and audio, and a “mountain of evidence,” said a committee aide who insisted on anonymity to preview the hearing. Information from Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who urged her father to call off the rioters, is likely to be shared from her private appearance before the committee. In the weeks ahead, the panel is expected to detail Trump’s public campaign to “Stop the Steal” and the private pressure he put on the Justice Department to reverse his election loss — despite dozens of failed court cases and his own attorney general attesting there was no fraud on a scale that could have tipped the results in his favor. The panel faced obstacles from its start. Republicans blocked the formation of an independent body that could have investigated the Jan. 6 assault the way the 9/11 Commission probed the 2001 terror attack. Instead, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ushered the creation of the 1/6 panel through Congress over the objections of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. She rejected Republican-appointed lawmakers who had voted on Jan. 6 against certifying the election results, eventually naming seven Democrats and two Republicans. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has been caught up in the probe and has defied the committee’s subpoena for an interview, echoed Trump on Thursday. He called the panel a “scam” and labeled the investigation a political “smokescreen” for Democrats’ priorities. By many measures, the attack was set in motion shortly after Election Day, when Trump falsely claimed the voting was rigged and refused to concede once Biden was declared the winner. The hearings are expected to introduce Americans to a cast of characters, some well known, others elusive, and to what they said and did as Trump and his allies tried to reverse the election outcome. The public will learn about the actions of Mark Meadows, the president’s chief of staff, whose 2,000-plus text messages provided the committee with a snapshot of the real-time scramble to keep Trump in office. Of John Eastman, the conservative law professor who was the architect of the unsuccessful scheme to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to halt the certification on Jan. 6. Of the Justice Department officials who threatened to resign rather than go along with Trump’s proposals. The Justice Department has arrested and charged more than 800 people for the violence that day, the biggest dragnet in its history. ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Michael Balsamo and Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed to this report. ___ For full coverage of the Jan. 6 hearings, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man.

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,"For Pride Month, Biden Should Probably Fill The Courts With Lesbian Judges",politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost It’s Pride Month, which means it’s time to talk about the lesbian takeover of America’s federal courts. It’s been happening over the past several months. Nobody has noticed. Luckily, HuffPost did. We crunched the numbers and discovered there’s been a staggering 43% increase in the number of openly lesbian women who have been put into lifetime federal judgeships since November. Surely this huge spike in lesbian judges will change the way the nation’s courts function. It raises questions, too, about whether President Joe Biden is going to run out of lesbians to pick from to be judges. Or why this reporter is not yet a federal judge. (I am available, sir.) Of course, this all requires some crucial context. Before Biden took office, there had only ever been seven openly lesbian women confirmed to lifetime federal judgeships. Now there are 10. That’s out of more than 3,700 people, the vast majority of whom have been men, who have ever been lifetime federal judges. So lesbian representation on the courts isn’t that great after all, is it? Nonetheless, ladies, here in Pride Month, it’s worth noting that Biden has made a dent in our abysmal numbers. He’s nominated and confirmed a total of four lesbian federal judges since last fall: Beth Robinson, the first-ever out lesbian to serve on a U.S. appeals court; Alison Nathan, the second out lesbian to serve on a U.S. appeals court; Charlotte Sweeney, the first openly LGBTQ judge on a U.S. district court in Colorado; and, just this week, Nina Morrison, now the second openly LGBTQ woman on a U.S. district court in New York. It’s worth looking at how Biden compares to his predecessors here. President Barack Obama put a total of five openly LGBTQ women into federal court seats during his eight years in office, out of his 329 lifetime federal judges. One of them was Nathan, whom he put into a district court seat before Biden later elevated her to an appeals court seat. President Donald Trump put one openly LGBTQ woman into a federal judgeship during his four years in office, now-U.S. district judge Mary Rowland. President Bill Clinton also put one openly lesbian woman, former U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts, into a federal judgeship during his eight years in the White House. And that’s all there’s been. As of Thursday, there are 77 current judicial vacancies on the federal bench. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Biden is considering filling all of these seats with lesbian judges as proof of his commitment to honoring Pride Month.

11,Bipartisan Gun Talks Drag On As Group Hits ‘Sticking Points’,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The bipartisan group of senators working to address gun violence following the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, will need more time to craft legislation, its members said this week. The talks have centered on fairly narrow measures: funding for mental health, enhanced background checks, “red flag” laws and school security. Some lawmakers also want to ban teenagers from buying assault weapons, a move that would face steep GOP opposition. Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), the lead Republican negotiator, told reporters there are “sticking points everywhere” after a meeting of the group this week. He warned Democrats not to impose “arbitrary deadlines,” expressing optimism about reaching an agreement “in the next couple of weeks.” His Democratic counterpart, Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), endorsed that timeline and said he hoped to bring a final bill to the Senate floor before its July 4 recess. “It’ll be a miracle if we get a framework agreement, never mind a final bill. But miracles sometimes happen,” Murphy said. “We’re making great progress,” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost after another meeting on Thursday, adding that no deal was imminent. Democrats initially hoped to get a deal on a framework for the bill by the end of the week. The bipartisan group plans to talk again on Friday in search of agreement. In the past, negotiations over similar gun control measures following other mass shootings stalled as news coverage of the atrocities faded and the nation’s attention turned to other things. Lawmakers are hoping this time will be different. “As soon as the bipartisan group comes to an agreement, I want to bring a measure to the floor for a vote as quickly as possible,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Thursday, adding that the group is making “good progress.” A key difference between current and past gun negotiations prompted by mass shootings: the scope of the proposed response. After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, for example, lawmakers debated an assault weapons ban as well as whether to require background checks for firearm sales online and at gun shows. No assault weapons ban and no major expansion of background checks are on the table this time around. Meanwhile, the House passed several more gun control measures on Wednesday and Thursday, including a federal red flag law provision that would allow people to seek federal court orders to remove guns from someone posing an imminent threat, a ban on high-capacity gun magazines, and a requirement that gun owners lock up their weapons if they live with children. The House also approved a measure that would raise the age requirement for most rifle sales from 18 to 21. Ten Republicans voted for it. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost the fact that 10 House Republicans voted for a higher age requirement augured well for a similar policy being adopted in the bipartisan Senate negotiations. “I didn’t think it was going to get in. Now I do,” he said. Even though they favor much more ambitious legislation, progressive Democrats have said they’ll take what they can get from the Senate. Support for new gun restrictions ticked up following the recent mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo, New York. Americans favor raising the minimum legal age to buy any gun to 21 years old nationwide by a 74-24 margin, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Many Senate Republicans oppose the idea. Several have told HuffPost they’re willing to consider it, but Cornyn, who is influential, has said he thinks it might be unconstitutional. Murphy has seemingly sought to manage expectations about “raising the age,” suggesting it’s something that could jeopardize Republican support for the broader package. “We’re in pursuit of 60 votes,” he told HuffPost when asked about a higher age requirement. The idea is still getting kicked around ― after all, the shooters in Uvalde and Buffalo couldn’t have purchased their weapons from licensed gun dealers if it weren’t legal for 18-year-olds to do so. “You have to be 21 to buy a handgun, so saying you also have to be 21 to buy an assault rifle seems to make sense,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah.) told reporters. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,The Proud Boys' Jan. 6 Sedition Hearings Begin With Implications For Trump,politics," Senior Editor, HuffPost Five ranking members of the Proud Boys street gang are slated to appear in federal court on Thursday, the first hearing of a potentially historic case in which a group of Americans stand accused of conspiring to forcefully upend the U.S. government. The Proud Boys’ seditious conspiracy case centers on a handful of their leaders — Enrique Tarrio, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, Ethan Nordean and Dominic Pezzola — who prosecutors say were instrumental in the planning and execution of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors say the men led dozens of Proud Boys and thousands of Donald Trump supporters as they mobilized in Washington, D.C., that day in a violent effort to overturn Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in the 2020 election. Each of the accused faces a slew of federal charges, ranging from property destruction to civil disobedience. But the seditious conspiracy charges, tacked on earlier this week, give this case new meaning. Such charges are rarely brought forth, let alone prosecuted. The last successful seditious conspiracy case was lodged against a group of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb the United Nations in the 1990s. The decision to bring these charges against the Proud Boys now — and, in September, against several members of their allies in the Oath Keepers, a militant antigovernment group ― carries symbolic overtones, suggesting this is where the federal government pins much of the blame for the insurrection. The Proud Boys have an uphill battle to defend themselves: Prosecutors have already released reams of evidence that the gang was planning for a last stand for Trump in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. Nordean launched an online fundraiser for “protective gear and equipment” and posted a video telling his followers that the events of Jan. 6 would “bring back that original spirit of 1776 of what really established the character of what America is.” Biggs declared a “second civil war” in a blog post. Tarrio, the group’s chairman, allegedly looked over a planning document, titled “1776 Returns,” on Dec. 30, 2020, detailing plans to occupy various buildings in Washington on the big day, including several House and Senate office buildings. But the implications of this case extend well beyond the decades of prison time each Proud Boys leader faces. For one thing, the hearing is expected to offer the first honest look at how the federal government views the street gang, which has been engaged in a nationwide campaign of political violence over the past five years. Federal agencies across the board have been criticized for their lackadaisical response to the Proud Boys, who have been involved in many of the nation’s most notorious acts of political violence since Trump took office, culminating in their alleged outsize role in the insurrection. More intriguingly, the case offers the chance to see Proud Boys testifying against one another. Several members have already taken plea deals in their Jan. 6 cases that would compel them to take the stand. One of them is Charles Donohoe, a chapter leader in North Carolina, who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in April, admitted there was a plan to storm the Capitol prior to Jan. 6, and agreed to cooperate fully with the feds. It’s not clear what that testimony will reveal, but it could give us a clearer picture of what Trump and company were doing before and during the Capitol attack. Members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were close to Trump and his allies, especially Roger Stone, Trump’s political confidant and friend. The Oath Keepers served as Stone’s security on Jan. 5 and the morning of Jan. 6, and both Tarrio and the Oath Keepers’ leader, Stewart Rhodes, were members of a group chat on Stone’s phone called “Friends of Stone.” Stone has for years been the Proud Boys’ closest connection to the former president, and their relationship has afforded the gang a degree of political clout that no other extremist group in America enjoys. Whatever revelations the Proud Boys case may yield, they’ll come in tandem with those unearthed by a House committee tasked with investigating the events of Jan. 6. Those hearings are also set to begin on Thursday.

14,GOP Candidate Carl Paladino Calls Adolf Hitler 'The Kind Of Leader We Need Today',politics," Reporter, HuffPost Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Republican House candidate Carl Paladino praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s ability to rouse “the crowds” and declared Hitler “the kind of leader we need today” in a February 2021 interview on the radio station WBEN in Buffalo, New York. Paladino, a businessman and leading GOP figure in New York state who was the party’s gubernatorial nominee in 2010, is running for the Republican nomination to replace the retiring Rep. Chris Jacobs (R-N.Y.). Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), chair of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking position in GOP House leadership, swiftly endorsed Paladino after Jacobs announced his retirement. Jacobs became a target of conservative gun rights activists following his endorsement of limited gun control measures. When presented with Paladino’s statement that Hitler is “the kind of leader we need today,” Stefanik claimed it was taken out of context. “I condemn any statement, but don’t take it out of context,” Stefanik told HuffPost. “That is not accurate reporting.” Paladino’s pro-Hitler comments, first reported by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters, were made on The r-House Radio Show, a radio show hosted by real estate company executive Peter Hunt on a local Buffalo radio station. “[M]any people don’t voice their opinion or just become, see it as utter futility,” Hunt said. “How do you rouse the population? How do you get people thinking about the possibility of change here in New York state and what that might mean for our, for everyone here?” “I was thinking the other day about — somebody had mentioned on the radio Adolf Hitler and how he aroused the crowds,” Paladino responded, chuckling a little bit as he said the Nazi dictator’s name. “And he would get up there screaming these epithets and these people were just — they were hypnotized by him. That’s, I guess, I guess that’s the kind of leader we need today. We need somebody inspirational.” Adolf Hitler was the fascist dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide at the end of World War II in 1945. He was responsible for ending democracy in Germany and starting a war for global domination that cost the lives of between 75 and 80 million people. That included approximately six million Jews mass murdered who died in the Holocaust, the attempted genocide of Jewish people orchestrated by Hitler. Paladino released a statement Thursday saying that he does not actually support Hitler. “Any implication that I support Hitler or any of the sick and disgusting actions of the Nazi regime is a new low for the media,” he said. “The context of my statement was in regards to something I heard on the radio from someone else and was repeating, I understand that invoking Hitler in any context is a serious mistake and rightfully upsets people. I strongly condemn the murderous atrocities committed against the Jewish people by Hitler and the Nazis.” He also pointed to comments he made 12 years ago, in which he denounced Hitler and the Holocaust. “There are some things in this world that we must all be angry about. During World War II, all decent people were angry at Hitler’s extermination of six million Jews in the gas chambers of Auschwitz,” he said in 2010. “During the days of the civil rights battle here in the United States, all decent people were angry at the brutal mistreatment of black people down South.” Stefanik also pointed to this quote in the House GOP press briefing Thursday, as an indication that Paladino does not love Hitler. But neither she nor Paladino included the part of the quote where Paladino compared gay marriage to the evil of the Holocaust, including it in the list of “some things in this world that we must all be angry about.” “Congresswoman Stefanik has one of the strongest records in the U.S. Congress condemning anti-Semitism and led and passed bipartisan legislation to expand Holocaust education,” an adviser to Stefanik told HuffPost, further trying to distance the congresswoman from the comments of the man she endorsed. This isn’t Paladino’s first brush with controversy. In 2016, he said in an interview that he would like to see President Barack Obama die from mad cow disease and First Lady Michelle Obama “return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.” Those comments led to Paladino being removed from the Buffalo School Board. This piece has been updated with comment from Paladino and Stefanik. Reporter, HuffPost Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,DOJ Opens Probe Into Louisiana State Police Over Beatings Of Black Men,politics," BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department is opening a “pattern-or-practice” investigation into the Louisiana State Police amid mounting evidence that the agency has looked the other way in the face of beatings of mostly Black men, including the deadly 2019 arrest of Ronald Greene. The federal action, which officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press will be announced later Thursday, comes more than three years after white troopers were captured on long-withheld body-camera video beating, stunning and dragging Greene on a rural roadside near Monroe. Despite lengthy, ongoing federal and state investigations into a death that troopers initially blamed on a car crash, no one has yet been charged. An AP investigation found Greene’s arrest was among at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. Dozens of current and former troopers said the beatings were countenanced by a culture of impunity, nepotism and, in some cases, outright racism. AP’s reporting found troopers have made a habit of turning off or muting body cameras during pursuits. When footage is recorded, the agency has routinely refused to release it. And a recently retired supervisor who oversaw a particularly violent clique of troopers told internal investigators last year that it was his “common practice” to rubber-stamp officers’ use-of-force reports without ever reviewing body-camera video. In some cases, troopers omitted uses of force such as blows to the head from official reports, and in others troopers sought to justify their actions by claiming suspects were violent, resisting or escaping, all of which were contradicted by video footage. Those who confirmed the “pattern-or-practice” investigation spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the inquiry before it was announced. A state police spokesman had no immediate comment but said the agency plans to issue a statement later Thursday. Black leaders have for months been urging the Justice Department to launch a broader investigation into potential racial profiling by the overwhelmingly white state police, similar to other probes opened over the past year in Minneapolis, Louisville and Phoenix. By its own tally, 67% of state police uses of force in recent years were against Black people, who make up 33% of the state’s population. The action comes as Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards prepares to testify before a bipartisan panel of state lawmakers investigating Greene’s death. Edwards and his lawyers privately watched the video showing Greene taking his final breaths during his fatal arrest — footage that didn’t reach prosecutors until nearly two years after Greene’s May 10, 2019, death. Federal prosecutors also are still investigating whether police brass obstructed justice to protect troopers in the Greene case — and whether they sought to conceal evidence of troopers beating other Black motorists. ___ Bleiberg reported from Uvalde, Texas.

16,Biden Expects 'Mini Revolution' With Many Politicians Voted Out If SCOTUS Overturns Roe,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden predicted Wednesday that there will be a “mini revolution” with several politicians voted out of office if the Supreme Court overturns abortion rights. “There’s a whole range of things that are at stake here when we talk about eliminating Roe v. Wade,” Biden explained on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” referring to the landmark 1973 ruling. “It’s just ridiculous in my view.” Biden said he expects the country will react if the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is consistent with a leaked draft majority opinion. That draft, published by Politico, would overturn both Roe and a later abortion case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey ― paving the way for states to severely restrict or outright ban the procedure. “I don’t think the country will stand for it,” Biden told host Jimmy Kimmel during the interview, which was his first in-studio late night appearance as president. In the leaked draft, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito argued the issue of abortion should go back to the states, many of which have already moved to restrict access. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito writes in the draft. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled ... It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” The president said his administration is looking at whether it could issue an executive order on abortion rights. “It’s clear that if in fact the decision comes down the way it does, and these states impose the limitations they’re talking about, it’s going to cause a mini revolution and they’re going to vote a lot of these folks out of office,” Biden said. Biden also urged people to turn out and vote to get their voices heard. “You gotta vote, let people know exactly what the devil you think,” he said. Kimmel also asked Biden if he would consider issuing an executive order on guns in the wake of multiple recent mass shootings, including the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers. “I have issued executive orders within the power of the presidency to be able to deal with these, everything having to do with guns and gun ownership ... all the things that are within my power,” Biden said. “What I don’t want to do ― and I’m not being facetious ― I don’t want to emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and the constitutional authority,” he continued.

1,The U.S. Is Shifting Money To COVID Vaccines As Congress Stalls And Subvariants Spread,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration is preparing to shift COVID-19 money away from critical public health programs, including testing, to pay for new vaccines and therapeutics, as Congress stalls on approving additional pandemic funding and omicron subvariants spread across the country. A White House official told The Washington Post the administration is taking away $10 billion in total from existing pandemic funding, half of which will go to finance updated vaccines — when those become available — and the other half will pay for treatments, including the Pfizer drug Paxlovid. This funding shift will undercut other initiatives, including plans to produce more COVID-19 tests in the U.S., and a plan to stockpile ventilators and personal protective equipment, another aide told the Post. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, has repeatedly issued warnings to Congress that the U.S. is in need of COVID-19 funding to be prepared for future waves. “If you want to ask what keeps me awake at night, it is that we are going to run out of vaccines,” Jha told reporters in the White House briefing room Friday. “We’re not going to be able to have enough of the next generation of vaccines. We’re going to run out of treatments. And we’re going to run out of diagnostic tests, probably in the late fall into winter, if we end up having a significant surge of infections.” The money scramble comes as two omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5 are spreading fast around the country. BA.4 made up 5.4% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. the week ending June 4, while BA.5 accounted for 7.6% of cases during the same period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both subvariants were first detected in South Africa, where they drove an increase in cases in April and May, according to The New York Times. Still, deaths did not increase as dramatically, and that COVID-19 wave was smaller than previous ones there, Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, told the Times. Shaman expects to see cases rise due to BA.4 and BA.5, but without necessarily seeing a rise in hospitalizations and deaths, if the U.S. follows a similar trajectory to South Africa. For now, BA.2.12.1 still remains the dominant variant, making up over 62% of total cases in the U.S., according to CDC data. Overall, the constant emergence of new subvariants that are able to evade immune responses has meant many Americans have been getting reinfected with COVID-19. Jennifer McDonnell, who lives in Illinois, told ABC News she got the coronavirus in January and thought she could go back to normal life, especially since she had also been fully vaccinated and boosted, only to discover she had been reinfected with COVID-19 within a month, after her doctor ran a test. “When he told me that I was positive for COVID-19 again, I thought, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me,’” McDonnell said. “I thought you know six months, I’m good. I don’t need to wear a mask. We were at like a whole bunch of sporting events … at parties without masks, no social distancing — nothing — we thought we had time.” McDonnell is hardly alone in experiencing reinfection. More than 1.6 million Americans across 24 states have reported getting reinfected with the virus since states started tracking this data, according to ABC. Jha told “CBS Mornings” on Wednesday that the U.S. is not at the stage where it can deal with COVID-19 in the same way it does with the flu, noting the high number of infections, which have been averaging over 100,000 per day this past week. “We are taking a very active, aggressive approach to keeping hospitalizations down,” Jha said. “If we let up on vaccinations, if we let up on treatments, those hospitalizations are going to start climbing back up again.” “We’re in a battle, we’re fighting hard and keeping things at bay. It’s not time to let up and say, ‘OK, this is as good as it gets,’” Jha continued. Dr. @ashishkjha shares why officials are still taking a ""very active, aggressive” approach toward fighting COVID-19 — and gives advice to @GayleKing, who tested positive earlier this week. pic.twitter.com/mp3WNyk2HW Moderna said Wednesday a new vaccine it is developing, combining the original shot with protection against the omicron variant, is effective. The company said its preliminary study results showed those who took the updated shot experienced an eightfold increase in antibodies targeting omicron, according to The Associated Press. The White House announced Thursday vaccinations for children under age 5 could start as early as June 21. Once the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC grant final approval, the Biden administration will make 10 million doses available for pre-order to states, pharmacies and community health centers, with more to follow.

2,"With Jan. 6 Hearings, Democrats Shift Focus Back To Trump",politics," Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Politics Reporter, HuffPost Democrats hope Thursday’s prime-time hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol can begin a new effort to recast Republicans as the party of an extremist movement loyal to Donald Trump that poses a direct threat to democracy, a message they believe can limit their losses in November’s midterm elections. The hearing, set to air on all major broadcast networks, will be the start of a weeks-long case assembled by the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the Jan. 6 House select committee from more than 1,000 interviews and 140,000 documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the committee investigating the Capitol assault, told progressive activists in February that its revelations would “blow the roof off the House.” There is little hope among party operatives that the hearings can totally reverse a GOP-friendly political environment. Nearly every administration in history has seen its party lose seats during midterm elections, and rampant inflation has further hobbled President Joe Biden’s weak political standing. The GOP remains the heavy favorite to win control of the House and is likely to seize the Senate as well. The strategy has its skeptics, even within the party, who note that a relentless focus on former President Trump was not enough to win the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia and that the party’s massive gains in 2018 came after its candidates focused on kitchen-table issues such as health care. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), speaking to reporters Wednesday, framed the hearings as the start of a referendum on American democracy. “This is a way to have the American people make their own judgment: Was this ‘legitimate political discourse?’” Hoyer said, referencing a one-time Republican National Committee defense of the insurrection. “Is this the way you think democracy ought to be carried out? Is this the way you think citizens ought to make their points? If it is, we’re in real trouble, as a nation, as a democracy. Our Constitution is at risk.” Without directly mentioning the midterm elections, Hoyer said he hoped the hearings “will lead to action by the American people that will diminish very substantially the efforts to stoke such anger, such violence.” The hearings could be the highest-profile attempt by Democrats to tar the GOP as “ultra MAGA,” as Biden has put it: a party obsessed with false beliefs about the 2020 election, driven by a cult-like obedience to Trump, closely tied to extremist groups and willing to enact an unpopular agenda at any cost. “When you look at Jan. 6 protesters, both mobilization [Democratic-leaning] and persuasion [swing] voters have a very strong reaction,” Guy Cecil, the chair of Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, told reporters on Tuesday. “So there’s some real opportunity for us to continue to define what the next generation of the MAGA movement looks like.” Much of Cecil’s briefing for reporters focused on the growing extremism of the GOP, noting the group’s polling data found the QAnon conspiracy network, the “Make America Great Again” movement and Trump all remained unpopular with swing voters in key states. In surveys of persuadable voters from earlier this year, the group found Republicans held a general ballot advantage over Democrats — but that changed once a candidate was associated with Trump or the Capitol riot. Among the swing voters it polled in midterm battlegrounds — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — nearly three-quarters found it unfavorable if a candidate participated in the attack on Congress and 64% found it unfavorable if a candidate believed the attack was “legitimate political discourse.” And 50% view Trump’s “strong backing” of a candidate as a turn-off. Cecil highlighted an ad the group is running on digital platforms that uses the threat of Trump’s return as a presidential candidate in 2024 as a way to motivate Democrats who might otherwise be skeptical of the midterms’ importance. “Since Trump lost, far-right extremist groups are organizing across the country,” a narrator says in the 15-second ad. “Recruiting, disrupting, organizing to take over Congress in 2022 and return Trump to power.” Democrats have more work to do to convince even Democratic-leaning voters that the midterms are equally as important as the presidential election — 57% of Democratic-leaning “low-motivation” voters surveyed believe it doesn’t matter who wins 2022’s congressional races, up from the percentage who felt that way about the 2020 election, according to the Priorities USA survey. Party operatives said the effect of Jan. 6 is likely to differ state by state and race by race. In some states, such as Colorado and Michigan, Republicans are backing candidates who are likely to put election denialism front-and-center. The GOP has also nominated two candidates who were at the insurrection — J.R. Majewski and Sandy Smith — for swing congressional districts in Ohio and North Carolina, something Democrats view as a major misstep. “Republicans have the environment at their back. They’re going to make everything national, national, national,” said one senior Democrat working on House races. “We need to win these races one by one.” Republicans also nominated Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who attended Trump’s Jan. 6 rally and has been subpoenaed by the House committee, as their nominee for governor — a development that dampened GOP hopes of seizing control of a crucial swing state. So far, Jan. 6 seems to play a larger role in the battle for the House, gubernatorial races and secretary of state contests while playing a lesser role in the fight for control of the Senate. A majority of House Republicans voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, including GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell joined all but a handful of Republicans in voting to accept the election results. Not every Democratic strategist thinks a focus on Jan. 6 is the best use of the party’s time. While none wanted to be quoted downplaying the importance of a hearing investigating an attempt to overturn American democracy, some suggested that focusing on the insurrection — and on the GOP’s Trump-inspired authoritarian turn more broadly — would do little to win over the working-class voters the party needs to win. Instead, they recommended focusing on the GOP’s threats to strip abortion rights, on Democrats’ push to lower prescription drug prices or on Republicans’ loyalty to large corporations and the wealthy. But even kitchen-table issues are hard to unhitch from Trump, the party’s de facto leader. “He’s president of the Republican Party, and the Republican Party is trying to take control of Congress, and people need to understand that that is going to make their lives worse,” said former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia, who before the 2021 election warned that “being anti-Trump is not going to be enough” for Democrats. Republicans — or at least every Republican not named Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger — are expected to downplay and dismiss the hearings entirely, aiming to keep the focus on inflation. “Nancy Pelosi’s political witch hunt is purely partisan,” wrote Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a member of the House GOP leadership. Even in attacking Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who downplayed the insurrection as a “peaceful protest” and suggested the FBI knew about the attack on the Capitol in advance, Senate Democrats have avoided discussing Jan. 6. Instead, ads from Senate Majority PAC, which is controlled by allies of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have hammered Johnson for supporting tax cuts for himself and his wealthy donors.

3,A Conservative Tennessee Prosecutor’s Tough-On-Crime Approach Excludes Police,politics," Social Justice Reporter When Shelby County’s top prosecutor, Amy Weirich, was running for reelection in 2014, she declared, “I don’t apologize for being tough on crime.” In the years that followed, she lived up to that pledge. Over a long tenure as the top law enforcement official in a large Tennessee county that includes Memphis, Weirich has aggressively pursued violent and petty crime cases and cast herself as an unabashedly pro-police district attorney. Her office declined to bring charges against police officers who shot or killed people in Shelby County. It disproportionately locked up Black people, who make up 54% of Shelby County’s population and 85% of the people in the county’s jails. The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed multiple convictions secured by her office, and Harvard Law’s Fair Punishment Project found she engaged in more prosecutorial misconduct than any other district attorney in Tennessee. This fall, Weirich, a Republican, will face voters in this Democratic-leaning county for the first time in eight years. The election will be a referendum on her tough-on-crime agenda: Her Democratic opponent, Steven Mulroy, has advocated for a shift in Memphis’ criminal justice system and supports reform efforts such as establishing units to review prison sentences. It’s not just a question of philosophies. In 2020, Memphis reached its highest homicide total on record. The city broke that record again last year. Spikes in violent crime have vastly complicated the politics around criminal justice, and often the crime rate has been used as a cudgel against progressive, reform-minded prosecutors. This was shown true after San Francisco voters elected to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, one of the country’s most progressive top prosecutors. Boudin’s effort was centered around reforming the city’s criminal justice system, including actions such as ending cash bail and stopping the prosecution of minors as adults ― along with being the first DA in the city’s history to file homicide charges against police officers. Weirich sells herself as being tough on crime, but how will voters react when the crime rate has gone up anyway? HuffPost talked with former prosecutors who worked under Weirich, as well as attorneys for people shot by police. They described a prosecutor who was relentless in her efforts to crack down on crime but absolved the police of accountability: A leader whose approach drove down office morale. And they described how Shelby County and Memphis ― a majority-Black city that’s long suffered from poverty, sparse funding for education and a lack of economic opportunity for its Black residents ― have been hurt by her ruthless approach. Police in Shelby County have shot and killed 20 people during Weirich’s 11-year run as the county’s top prosecutor, but her office has not prosecuted a single one. A former prosecutor who worked in the Shelby County DA’s office and asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional consequences said an officer in the county who shot a person would not be “charged unless there are 100 witnesses and someone on video.” Pamela Fleming, who also worked under Weirich, said protecting police was part of the culture. “If you believe the police can be corrupt, we don’t know how you can be a prosecutor,” Fleming recalled higher-ups telling her during the decade she spent as a district attorney in the office. Weirich denied Fleming’s account in an interview with HuffPost, and pointed out that her office has prosecuted police for cases such as driving while under the influence, kidnapping and rape. But the office’s record on police shootings is clear: Officers have never been indicted ― let alone convicted ― in Memphis for fatally or non-fatally shooting civilians. Weirich’s office recommended charges against an officer in only one case, but the officer was never criminally charged. In the other cases, officers who violated department policy were not criminally held accountable. This is what happened in the case of Martavious Banks. A police officer critically injured Banks, who is Black, during a traffic stop in 2018. After police pulled Banks over, he told them he had no license or insurance and was driving his mother’s car. Banks drove away, but struck a curb within half a mile and got out of the car. Police said they saw a gun in the vehicle and that Banks reached down. Although a gun was found with Banks’ blood on it after the shooting, there was no indication Banks had threatened officers during the encounter. Banks attempted to flee into his house, according to police, and made it to the front porch when then-Memphis cop Jemarcus Jeames shot him five times. There’s no footage of the shooting. Only moments before it happened, the three officers on the scene turned off their body cameras, which was a violation of department policy. None of the officers were charged with a crime, although activists called for charges of attempted murder or assault with intent to commit a murder. Jeames resigned from the department, and the two other officers were disciplined with unpaid leave. Memphis lawmakers proposed that intentionally turning off a body camera and obstructing justice should be a felony violation, but the law never passed. Banks survived the shooting but wound up in jail. Weirich’s office charged him with evading arrest, reckless driving, having a revoked license and unlawful possession of a weapon due to a gun recovered inside his home. He was jailed for 11 months. After a plea agreement, Banks was released from jail on two years and 10 months probation. Banks sued the police department over the shooting, seeking $10 million for damages. He received a total of $200,000 in a settlement. Banks’ lawyer, Arthur Horne, said Jeames should have faced criminal prosecution. “Nationally, we have started to see more and more cases where cops are being prosecuted for being rogue officers,” Horne said. “Unfortunately, we have never had that here in Shelby County and can’t under Weirich’s administration. Her mantra is being tough on crime. It applies to people in this community, but it doesn’t apply to law enforcement.” Weirich said that Jeames acted “within the law” of the state of Tennessee even though he violated police department policy by turning off his camera. “If cops are killing people in self-defense or in defense of others, they have the legal right to do that. And I am not going to prosecute people who have not broke(n) the law.” When Weirich’s office attempted to bring charges against one police officer who fatally shot a civilian, a grand jury opted not to indict the officer. In 2015, Memphis police officer Connor Schilling shot and killed an unarmed 19-year-old named Darrius Stewart. Schilling stopped a car over a broken headlight. He said he saw that Stewart, who was a passenger in the vehicle, had multiple warrants for his arrest so he put him in the back of the police car. Schilling claimed that Stewart attacked him while sitting in the squad car and struck him with his handcuffs. A cellphone video from a witness showed the two struggling from the back of the patrol car to the ground. Schilling claimed he shot Stewart in self-defense, but an investigation conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations concluded Stewart was running away when Schilling shot him. Weirich’s office recommended involuntary manslaughter charges, but a grand jury decided not to indict Schilling. Federal authorities determined a year after the shooting that there was not enough evidence to conclude that Schilling had used unnecessary lethal force. Weirich has not looked to reopen the case. “The Darrius Stewart case was presented to the grand jury, I prepared an indictment, asked the case officer as I do in tens and thousands of cases, and the grand jury said no,” she said. Stewart’s family believes Weirich could have done more. The family filed a $17 million lawsuit against Schilling in 2020 and called for the case to be reopened. The lawsuit is still ongoing. “The general consensus is that you can indict a ham sandwich. When it comes to indicting officers, Amy [Weirich] can never seem to get it right,” Carlos Moore, an attorney for Stewart’s family, told HuffPost. “Compare her other indictments to what she does with cops who harm Black men, you would see a drastic difference.” Weirich defended her record in police violence cases and suggested her state’s laws made it difficult to obtain convictions or even indictments. Tennessee laws allow officers to use deadly force against someone who is fleeing or an “immediately dangerous felon.” Another former prosecutor who worked under Weirich and who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, said the office appeared to take a soft approach to police because they often had to work closely together. “[I] still don’t think that prevents you from being critical about police work and certain officers who have a record of not being credible or having certain behavior,” the former prosecutor said. Weirich has a far tougher approach when dealing with everyone else. She supports “truth in sentencing” laws, which require people convicted of a number of felonies to serve their full sentence without the possibility of receiving parole due to good behavior. In recent weeks, she doubled down on her support for “truth in sentencing” laws and has gone after Mulroy for not supporting them. “Make no mistake, this election is a clear choice between a DA who will fight for victims or a radical activist who sued our Sheriff to release prisoners from jail,” Weirich stated. “In many times, the system is not tough enough on violent offenders. They are sentenced to x amount of years and they are back on the streets.” Weirich’s rigid approach to crime was always a part of the office culture ― which at times has roiled her staff, according to conversations with four former employees. More than one of the interviewed prosecutors described her mentality as “dated,” and others said her approach to the city’s criminal justice system has been more or less a failure. Her office does not have an in-house unit to review its convictions and investigate claims of wrongful convictions. Such units have been established in more progressive district attorney offices throughout the country and have typically caused more good than harm in reviewing sentences. One of the former prosecutors said that Weirich told them “our entire office is” a conviction review unit. She has also spoken publicly against establishing such a unit in her office. But a prosecutor’s mentality is often different from one a review unit could provide, one prosecutor told HuffPost. “That mentality of ‘I’m not a social worker and I’m just here to prosecute this case,’ that mentality is not productive if you expect to change a culture of crime that we have here in Memphis,” the prosecutor said. “It is just not.” Prosecutors are also overworked. In 2018, the Prosecutor’s Center for Excellence, a policy group tasked with advising prosecutor offices in the country, found that many of the prosecutors in Weirich’s office were taking on too many cases to be able to do their jobs successfully. Weirich acknowledged the high caseload puts a strain on staff. “When you look at workload and caseload, we don’t have the amount of people that we need and we have no control of what comes through the door,” she said. “But, the DA office can’t say that. If a crime is committed and someone is arrested, we have to act.” Fleming said morale in the office has hit an “all-time low” during Weirich’s tenure. “The way she runs her office, it is about whatever is best for her image and making sure things do not cause discomfort for her,” Fleming said. “She talks, and gets photos-ops, but makes sure no one is making a stink. She does not care about what she does to her prosecutors on staff, it’s all about what will be in the paper.” Shelby County residents, particularly Black ones, are suffering most. The Justice Department investigated Shelby County’s juvenile court in 2018 and found that a majority of kids transferred to adult facilities were Black. The department’s report described Weirich tactics ― such as pushing for stiff sentencing on youth, aggressively prosecuting low-level crimes and not acknowledging youth mental illness ― as a “toxic combination for African-American youth.” “In Shelby County, this is only the most recent and high profile examples of how Weirich inflicts devastating harm among Black Memphians and their communities,” the letter reads. Local criminal justice advocates say Weirich’s office discriminates against Black people, citing poor diversity in the office and the high numbers of Black people in local prisons and jails. They have called for a racial equity audit of Weirich’s office, something at least two Shelby County Commissioners support. Mulroy, who is running against Weirich, called out the diversity in her office, claiming he had reviewed data and interviewed former employees to determine that only 30% of staff and 10% of attorneys in the office were Black. Mulroy said he obtained the data from the county and from interviews with former employees of the DA’s office. Weirich pushed back, calling Mulroy’s data “false” and “hypocritical.” In an interview with local Memphis television station Action News 5, Weirich said there are “more minorities” in supervisory positions in “our office right now than ever before.” Josh Spickler, a criminal justice advocate in Memphis who helped write the letter demanding an audit, was outspoken against Weirich’s handling of the case of Pamela Moses, a Black woman who was prosecuted for illegal voting when she attempted to register to vote despite being unaware that she was ineligible due to a prior felony conviction. She was initially sentenced to six years in prison until Weirich dropped the charges. Spickler told HuffPost that Moses never should have been charged and that Weirich’s actions were evidence of her overzealous pursuit to send people to jail. “Where in our society does this make any type of sense?” he said. “This was a Republican white DA prosecuting, in an election year, a Black woman who attempted to vote. It reeked of systemic and institutional racism and voter suppression and racism.” Weirich’s harsh approach never slowed down homicides in Memphis. In 2019, the city had the ninth highest murder rate in the nation. In 2020, Memphis set a grim record for homicides with 332 murders. The city’s totals increased again to 346 homicides last year, setting a new record in the city. But one of the former prosecutors said Weirich’s tough-on-crime model has ultimately been at the city’s expense. “The hard on crime mentality that you hear her say that people just want to be ‘soft on crime,’ the mentality she has mentioned since she has been in office, what has improved in our city crime wise?” the former prosecutor said. “Not a whole lot. None, nothing at all.” Social Justice Reporter"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,"Tony Siragusa, Former NFL Star, Dead At 55",politics," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,White House Lays Out Plan To Get COVID-19 Vaccines To Kids Under 5,politics," Reporter, HuffPost As parents across the country have long awaited a vaccine against the coronavirus for young children, doses for kids younger than 5 could be available as soon as June 21, according to the Biden administration. A year and a half after vaccines were made available to older U.S. adults in January 2021, senior administration officials laid out a plan to get vaccines to toddlers and babies on a press call Wednesday. By the middle of next week, the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee is expected to meet to decide whether to authorize the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for children under 5. Then, later in the week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would decide whether to recommend the vaccines. Pending FDA and CDC authorization, the Biden administration would immediately begin shipping doses across the country, with 10 million vaccine doses available for states, community health centers and pharmacies to pre-order, and millions more available in the following weeks. Parents will be able to get their kids vaccinated at pediatricians’ and other doctors’ offices, community health centers, children’s hospitals, local pharmacies and other community organizations. The administration also plans to work with libraries and children’s museums, as well as Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander and Native community groups to raise awareness and answer questions about the vaccine. They’ll be reaching out to parents through federal programs including WIC, SNAP, Medicaid and Head Start. Currently, vaccines are available only for children 5 and older and for adults. About two-thirds of Americans have been fully vaccinated so far. If vaccines are authorized for children under 5, nearly everyone in the U.S. would be eligible for the protection against the virus. Pfizer said late last month that three doses of its vaccine offer strong protection for toddlers and babies ages 6 months to 4 years old, and the company was providing its data to U.S. regulators. Moderna was also hoping to get approval to provide two doses of its vaccine for little kids sometime this summer. While coronavirus cases are currently far lower than they were during the major winter spike, COVID-19 cases have still risen significantly in recent weeks, with cases more than tripling over the last two months across the country. More than 300 people on average are dying of COVID-19 complications each day. Last month, the U.S. surpassed a horrific milestone of 1 million people dead from COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

11,Jan. 6 Committee To Put Trump ‘At The Center’ Of The Plan To Overturn Election,politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol plans to show starting Thursday night how the assault was part of a coordinated scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election and stop the transfer of power, with Donald Trump “at the center” of that plan, committee aides said. The bipartisan panel plans a series of six public hearings starting at 8 p.m. EDT, which will be carried live by all three broadcast TV networks. The first hearing is scheduled to include live testimony about the start of the violence by the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol as well as video clips from Trump White House officials, campaign officials and family members. “The facts will speak for themselves,” a committee aide told reporters Wednesday, on condition of anonymity, adding that the hearings will detail for Americans the “multi-step, coordinated attempt to overturn a presidential election and stop the transfer of power.” The hearing will feature testimony from the first police officer injured in the assault, Caroline Edwards, and from a documentary filmmaker who was following leaders of the extremist Proud Boys group in the days leading up to Jan. 6 and was present at the start of the violence that afternoon. Much of the material, committee aides said, has never been seen by the public. “There will be a lot of new information revealed,” the aide said. Another aide said the challenge is to connect innumerable dots into a single coherent narrative that people can readily understand. “Our aim is to sort of try and tie all that together,” the aide said, also on condition of anonymity. “It’s a pattern that started before the election and went all the way through Jan. 6…. There’s a pattern that I would say continues to this day.” Committee chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and vice chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, are planning to preview expected themes and testimony in the coming hearings. The second is planned for Monday morning and the third for Wednesday. That the hearings are starting, the aides said, does not mean the committee is done gathering evidence. Thanks to a ruling from a federal judge in California, for example, it received access to another batch of emails from lawyer John Eastman, who was advocating a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to simply declare Trump the winner, notwithstanding the election result. “We’re viewing this as revealing our initial findings to the American people,” the first aide said. “The investigation is ongoing.” Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and by 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― led to the deaths of five people, including one police officer, injuries to an additional 140 officers and four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.

12,House Republicans Suggest More Prayers Would Solve Mass Shooting Problem,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost According to House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), if everyone had just prayed more, 19 children and two teachers might not have been massacred by a gunman in a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school last month. The House Oversight Committee held a hearing Wednesday on gun violence and heard testimony from survivors and families of victims from the Uvalde and Buffalo, New York, mass shootings. The speakers included an 11-year-old who covered herself in her friend’s blood and played dead as her classmates were killed. Gohmert complained in a House floor speech that Democrats “sure don’t want to hear any more about prayers” as a solution to the issue. “They’re disgusted hearing about prayers,” he said. “Look, maybe if we heard more prayers from leaders of this country instead of taking God’s name in vain, we wouldn’t have the mass killings like we didn’t have before prayer was eliminated from school,” he added. Scalise used a similar line of reasoning in a news conference, arguing that “we had AR-15s in the 1960s. We didn’t have those mass school shootings.” “We actually had prayer in school during those days,” he said. Gohmert: Maybe if we heard more prayers from leaders in this country instead of taking god’s name in vain, we wouldn’t have the mass killings like we didn’t have before prayer was eliminated from schools pic.twitter.com/vq1BQFzPkA In “those days,” when school-sponsored prayers were still in action, schools were hardly peaceful. Many schools were still segregated, and there were violent campaigns to keep it that way. In 1957, for example ― five years before the Supreme Court struck down state-sponsored prayers in public schools in 1962 ― an all-white Nashville elementary school was bombed a day after a Black child was admitted. White church members had been leading a violent crusade to oppose the integration of the city’s public schools. The AR-15 was first produced two years later, in 1959, predominantly for use by the military. It wasn’t until the 1980s that civilian models were mass produced. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an assault weapon ban that outlawed the AR-15 and similar semiautomatic rifles after a rise in mass shootings involving those types of firearms. Mass shootings were down in the decade that followed, compared with the decade before and the decade after. Scalise and Gohmert are far from the first Republicans to cite a departure from Jesus as a contributor to rising gun violence. Also during Wednesday’s hearing, Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) argued that guns had always been readily available in the U.S. but mass shootings were a more recent phenomenon. He correlated that with a “breakdown of the family,” “erosion of faith” and the proliferation of social media. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) argued last month that “we don’t need more gun control. We need to return to God.” And Oklahoma GOP Senate candidate Jackson Lahmeyer said after the Uvalde shooting it was time to arm teachers and “bring back prayer in our public schools.” Other Western countries have become increasingly secular without seeing increasing gun violence. In Australia, for example, there hasn’t been a comparable mass shooting since 1996, when a massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks to remove semi-automatic firearms from civilian possession.

14,"House Approves Gun Control Bills, Including Higher Age For Assault Rifles",politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a package of gun control bills that, among other things, would raise the age requirement for most rifle sales from 18 to 21. Rather than becoming law, the legislation will land on the growing pile of House-passed bills that the Senate ignores. That pile already includes a recent measure to require criminal background checks for all firearm sales. But the Senate has been busier than usual in the wake of horrific mass murders in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, in which teenage gunmen legally purchased assault rifles to slaughter more than 30 people, including 19 children in an elementary school. Since last week, a bipartisan group of senators has been privately negotiating a compromise gun bill that would make modest changes to the criminal background check system, boost funding for mental health services and encourage states to enact “red flag” laws allowing police to take guns from people who pose an imminent threat. Senators involved in the negotiations say they’ve also considered raising the age requirement for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21, but that it’s unlikely enough Republicans will support the change for it to be included in a final compromise. Federal law prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to people younger than 21, but allows rifle and shotgun sales to anyone over 18. In addition to raising the rifle age to 21, the House package would ban high-capacity magazines, require parents to lock up their firearms at home and prohibit firearm purchases on behalf of third parties. “There is no question that children ― and that’s what they are ― should not be buying AR-15s before they are 21,” Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said during floor debate before Wednesday’s vote, referring to the type of gun the recent mass shooters used. “It has been proven that the male brain has not developed to a certain point to be trusted at that time with that type of weapon,” Cohen said. “Those are weapons of war.” The legislation passed mostly along partisan lines, with Democrats in support and a handful of members switching sides on some provisions. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who has long supported a higher age requirement for rifle purchases, was one of 10 Republicans who voted in favor of that provision. He told HuffPost before the vote that high-profile mass shootings are “overwhelmingly done by men under the age of 21.” The House omitted an assault weapon ban from Wednesday’s slate of legislation, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said the House would soon hold hearings on such a bill. Dr. Roy Guerrero, a pediatrician from Uvalde, testified before a House committee earlier on Wednesday that the victims he saw after last month’s shooting had been “so pulverized by the bullets fired at them” that they were recognizable only by their clothes. “Innocent children all over the country today are dead because laws and policy allows people to buy weapons before they’re legally even old enough to buy a pack of beer,” Guerrero said. Even though a higher age requirement would have prevented several high-profile mass shooters from buying their weapons in the manner that they did, Republicans have brushed off the proposal as overly burdening Second Amendment rights. “You might have put a speed bump in front of this one kid,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) told HuffPost. “Does that mean that you change the rules for tens of millions of others?” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,"U.S. Proposes New Marine Sanctuary Off New York, Home To Sperm Whales And Sea Turtles",politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration proposed a new marine sanctuary off the coast of New York on Wednesday and said it would move to ban the sale of single-use plastics from all public lands over the next decade. The White House said the measures, a slate of environmental moves announced on World Oceans Day, would help “conserve and restore the health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans.” The proposed national marine sanctuary would encompass the Hudson Canyon, a deep underwater valley that lies about 100 miles off the coast of New York and New Jersey. The canyon, one of the largest in the world, is up to 2.5 miles deep in parts and provides habitat for sperm whales, sea turtles, octopuses and deep sea corals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it would begin a public comment period on the matter and will then consider what it would be called and what areas it would encompass. The full process, which would also include an environmental impact analysis and management plan, could take more than a year, The Washington Post reported. “A sanctuary near one of the most densely populated areas of the Northeast U.S. would connect diverse communities across the region to the ocean and the canyon in new and different ways,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “As someone who grew up in New York City and went on to a career in ocean science, I am excited about how this amazing underwater environment can inspire shared interest in conserving our ocean.” Announcing: Hudson Canyon National Marine Sanctuary DesignationYou are invited to participate in the first step in the process to potentially designate a new national marine sanctuary off the coast of New York and New Jersey, known as Hudson Canyon.https://t.co/YvH6wY053q pic.twitter.com/KRWNOEZ4Ci The Interior Department also said Wednesday it would move to phase out the sale of single-use plastics on public lands by 2032, which includes national parks. The agency noted that plastic pollution remains a major problem on public lands, adding that less than 10% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled. “The Interior Department has an obligation to play a leading role in reducing the impact of plastic waste on our ecosystems and our climate,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “As the steward of the nation’s public lands, including national parks and national wildlife refuges, and as the agency responsible for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats, we are uniquely positioned to do better for our Earth.” The move was hailed by environmental groups. “Our national parks, by definition, are protected areas — ones that Americans have loved for their natural beauty and history for over a century — and yet we have failed to protect them from plastic for far too long,” Christy Leavitt, the plastics campaign director for Oceana, a nonprofit ocean conservation group, said in a statement. “The Department of Interior’s single-use plastic ban will curb millions of pounds of unnecessary disposable plastic in our national parks and other public lands, where it can end up polluting these special areas.” President Joe Biden campaigned on goals of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known as the “30 by 30” initiative. Those efforts included rolling back former President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle protections for several national monuments, but Biden has also pledged to establish new protected sites to address climate change and safeguard important ecological zones.

16,Savannah Guthrie Reveals Husband Consulted For Johnny Depp's Legal Team,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Longtime “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie disclosed that her husband, Michael Feldman, had provided consulting services to actor Johnny Depp and his legal team shortly before launching into an interview with two of Depp’s most high-profile attorneys: Benjamin Chew and Camille Vasquez. “A quick disclosure: My husband has done consulting work for the Depp legal team, but not in connection with this interview,” Guthrie said Wednesday. She then continued with her questions, “with that aside.” NBC did not return a request for comment on whether Guthrie’s interview could be perceived as an ethical violation, given that she could have reason to portray her husband’s clients favorably. Depp emerged largely victorious over ex-wife Amber Heard in the weeks-long defamation trial that concluded last week. A Virginia court ordered Heard to pay Depp more than $10 million after jurors decided she had not been truthful in describing herself as a survivor of domestic abuse in a 2018 Washington Post opinion article. Jurors also found Depp liable for one statement made by an attorney representing him, awarding Heard $2 million. The pair were married in early 2015 and filed for divorce in 2016. Watch @SavannahGuthrie's full interview with Johnny Depp's attorneys, Camille Vasquez and Benjamin Chew. pic.twitter.com/lGqAHBzaKQ Asked to “square” the jury’s split decision, Vasquez told Guthrie, “I think it’s just. The verdict is overwhelmingly positive for Johnny.” Public opinion certainly appeared to side overwhelmingly with Depp. On social media, the volume of hashtags used in support of Depp dwarfed the volume of hashtags supporting Heard ― whose team used those metrics to accuse Depp’s side of funding an online smear campaign. Depp’s attorneys told Guthrie the smear campaign accusation was “categorically false.” The trial seemed to make a star out of Vasquez in particular for the aggressive tone she used to question Heard on the stand; she was promoted to partner at her law firm this week. In a statement released before Depp’s team’s multiple television appearances, Heard’s spokesperson dismissed the move as “unseemly” and “unprofessional.” Notably, Guthrie did not provide the same disclosure about Feldman’s activities when she interviewed an attorney for Heard, Elaine Bredehoft, the day after the verdict was returned. Feldman, a public relations consultant and former Democratic Party political adviser, co-founded the Democratic-leaning Glover Park Group consultancy firm in 2001 alongside top campaign staffers for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. A number of the company’s hires over the years came from Democratic congressional offices, according to Legistorm. The firm completed a merger last year and was renamed Finsbury Glover Hering Global. With his specialty in entertainment, Feldman gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 to explain how he decided to, in writer Tina Daunt’s words, “carve out the niche as Hollywood’s PR guy in D.C.” (He said it “all began with ‘An Inconvenient Truth,’” Gore’s documentary on climate change.) Finsbury Glover Hering also did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. In working for Depp, however, Feldman joins other former advisers to top Democrats in helping rehabilitate the troubled public images of famous men: A former top adviser to Barack Obama lent a hand in helping to advise disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein in the fall of 2017; another former Obama administration official, Christina Tchen, provided help to disgraced New York Gov.

1,Democratic Sen. Jon Tester Opposes New Restrictions On Semi-Automatic Weapons,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) says he does not support new restrictions on semi-automatic rifles, such as the weapon used to carry out the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and countless other shootings in recent years. “At this moment in time, no,” Tester, who is a gun owner, told HuffPost on Wednesday. When asked specifically about raising the minimum purchase age of such guns, the senator suggested expanding background checks and preventing mentally ill people from obtaining guns instead. “I think all this stuff is moot,” Tester said, expressing frustration with where things stand at the moment. “I’d like to have a debate on anything on the floor of the Senate at this moment in time ... but we’re a long ways away from even having a conversation about background checks much less anything else. I hope we get something done. This problem is not going to go away.” A spokesman for Tester added that the senator believes Congress should “focus on solutions that can get at least 60 votes in the Senate.” Federal law restricts handgun sales by licensed dealers to buyers 21 and up while allowing 18-year-olds to buy shotguns and rifles. The accused gunmen in the recent mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo, New York, are 18-year-olds who legally purchased their semi-automatic weapons. Senate Democrats introduced legislation last month that would raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines from 18 to 21. Senators on both sides of the aisle have expressed an openness to doing so in the wake of the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, where 19 children were killed. Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), a red-state Democrat who holds pro-gun views, this week questioned why individuals need to own high-powered AR-style rifles at all. “I never thought I had a need for that type of a high-capacity automatic weapon,” Manchin told CNN on Monday. “I like to shoot, I like to go out and hunt. I like to go out sports shooting. I do all of that. But I’ve never felt I needed something of that magnitude.” Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), a member of GOP leadership, said Wednesday she is open to the idea of raising the purchasing age for long guns. “I’m hearing pros and cons from Iowans and people concerned on both sides of the issue, so just trying to keep an open mind as we’re taking it all in. ... I’m not a no,” Ernst told HuffPost. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has also “personally expressed openness to raising the age for purchases of assault weapons to 21,” though the Kentucky Republican is not currently pushing to do so as part of any legislation, according to Politico. Still, many other Republicans are outright opposed to passing any new regulations on guns, including banning teenagers from being able to purchase semi-automatic rifles. In defending the need for such weapons, several GOP lawmakers have cited their constituents’ stated desire to shoot animals like pigs, raccoons, and prairie dogs. “In my state, they use them to shoot prairie dogs and other types of varmint,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told CNN earlier this week. Asked by HuffPost whether killing varmints was a good enough reason to allow teenagers to be able to buy AR-style weapons, Thune said it is an issue best left up to individual states, pointing to Florida’s raising of its gun purchasing age in the wake of a mass shooting as an example. He also allowed that you don’t necessarily need an AR-15 to shoot prairie dogs. “They can shoot prairie dogs with other types of things but it’s a recreational thing, it’s a sporting thing, it’s a hunting thing,” Thune explained. Semi-automatic weapons are often favored by hunters of wild hogs as they allow for a faster second shot than can be achieved with a bolt or lever action. But an AR-15 rifle isn’t the only option available to hunters. Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), another gun owner from a state where hunting is popular, argued that AR-15 rifles weren’t made for recreational use and that they should be banned. “We use them in war zones, we shouldn’t be using them in children’s homes. There’s no need for them. I’m a gun owner, I even have a target range in my backyard,” Leahy said. “In Vermont, we limit the number of rounds you can have in a semi-automatic during deer season. The country ought to be limiting the number of rounds and protecting children. Deer can take care of themselves,” he added. Tester, meanwhile, suggested that using an AR-15 to shoot small animals isn’t practical. “I don’t have the kind of money to be able to afford to shoot prairie dogs with a gun that spits out bullets quite that quickly. Now give me a .308 [rifle], and you can pop them from a long ways away,” he said. Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.

2,The Absurdity Of Comparing Guns And Airplanes After A Tragedy,politics," Reporter, HuffPost GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, one of the biggest recipients of funding from gun lobbyists, drew a farcical parallel on Wednesday between enacting gun control measures after mass shootings and banning airplanes after the 9/11 attacks. “Airplanes were used that day as the weapon to kill thousands of people and to inflict terror on our country. There wasn’t a conversation about banning airplanes,” the member of House Republican leadership said, pushing back against Democrats’ efforts to pass gun safety legislation in the wake of a gunman slaughtering 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. Scalise isn’t making the clever comparison that he thinks he is. “Airplanes were used on [9/11] as the weapon to kill thousands of people and to inflict terror on our country. There wasn't a conversation about banning airplanes,” GOP Rep. Steve Scalise says while arguing against gun control measures pic.twitter.com/ll5sVixuUI There is no effort in Congress to ban guns. Democrats are trying to pass legislation that includes expanding background checks during firearm transactions, establishing “red flag” laws that allow for the temporary removal of guns from people deemed a risk to themselves or others, and raising the age to purchase some semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21. Those are all measures designed to keep guns out of the hands of people planning attacks ― sort of like how lawmakers acted after 9/11 to keep planes out of reach from people planning attacks. Within two months of 9/11, Congress recognized the weaknesses in air travel security procedures and approved the creation of the Transportation Security Administration. That new agency, TSA, went on to establish dozens of new security measures, including screening all luggage with 3D-imaging X-ray machines, sending passengers through full-body scanners, banning knives on board aircrafts and reinforcing cockpit doors. “There was a conversation about connecting the dots,” Scalise recalled Wednesday of the days following 9/11. “How can we try to figure out if there are signs we can see to stop the next attack from happening? And some people might have thought that wasn’t possible. And yet, because Congress came together and focused on the root cause of the problem, thank God we have been able to stop other attacks on our homeland.” The root cause of the U.S.’s high number of mass shootings, extensive evidence shows, is the colossal number of guns on American soil coupled with flimsy restrictions on who can buy firearms and what kind can be sold. When examined globally, the only consistent factor positively associated with higher rates of mass shootings is a higher rate of gun ownership. Scalise didn’t mention that after 9/11, the entire airspaces of the United States and Canada were shut down for more than a day. By the logic he espoused Wednesday, all gun sales should pause after mass shootings. There’s also the fact that airplanes are designed as means of mass transportation, unlike assault weapons, which are designed to assault. American deaths from gun violence dwarf those from airplane and terrorist incidents combined. In 2020, there were 696 mass shootings ― defined as incidents in which four or more people are shot ― resulting in 661 deaths. The U.S. has not seen a single death from a commercial airline crash in over a decade. Scalise made his remarks the same day several parents of people killed and injured in the recent slew of mass shootings testified before the House Oversight Committee with pleas for swift action on gun control. “If after hearing from me and the other people testifying here today does not move you to act on gun laws, I invite you to my home to help me to clean Zaire’s wounds so that you may see up close the damage that has been caused to my son and my community,” Zeneta Everhart, whose son Zaire Goodman was injured in last month’s Buffalo shooting, told lawmakers.

3,Brookings Institution Places Its President On Leave Amid FBI Probe,politics," The prestigious Brookings Institution placed its president, retired four-star Marine Gen. John Allen, on administrative leave Wednesday amid a federal investigation into Allen’s foreign lobbying. Brookings’ announcement came a day after The Associated Press reported on new court filings that show the FBI recently seized Allen’s electronic data as part of an investigation into his role in an illegal foreign lobbying campaign on behalf of the wealthy Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. An FBI agent said in an affidavit in support of a search warrant there was “substantial evidence” that Allen had knowingly broken a foreign lobbying law. Allen had made false statements and withheld “incriminating” documents, the FBI agent’s affidavit said. Allen has not been charged with any crimes and previously denied any wrongdoing. Brookings told staffers Wednesday that the institute itself is not under federal investigation. The think tank’s executive vice president, Ted Gayer, will serve as acting president. “Brookings has strong policies in place to prohibit donors from directing research activities,” the email said. “We have every confidence in the Brookings team’s ability to remain focused on delivering quality, independence, and impact.” The federal investigation involving Allen has already ensnared Richard G. Olson, a former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan who pleaded guilty to federal charges last week, and Imaad Zuberi, a prolific political donor now serving a 12-year prison sentence on corruption charges. Several members of Congress have been interviewed as part of the investigation. The new court filings detail Allen’s behind-the scenes efforts to help Qatar influence U.S. policy in 2017 when a diplomatic crisis erupted between the gas-rich Persian Gulf monarchy and its neighbors. Allen’s alleged work for Qatar involved traveling to Qatar and met with the country’s top officials to offer them advice on how to influence U.S. policy, as well as promoting Qatar’s point of view to top White House officials and members of Congress, the FBI’s affidavit says. Brookings is one of the most prestigious think thanks in the U.S. Allen, who was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution prior to becoming president in late 2017, used his official email account at the think tank for some of his Qatar-related communications, the affidavit says. Qatar has long been one of Brookings’ biggest financial backers, though the institution says it has recently stopped taking Qatari funding. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died.

We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man.

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,Trump And His Kids Set To Testify In New York Attorney General's Investigation,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump is set to testify next month along with two of his adult children for a civil investigation into the family’s real estate business by the New York attorney general. Trump and his children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump are tentatively set to testify on July 15 to discuss their roles in the Trump Organization, CNBC reported Wednesday. Attorney General Letitia James is probing Trump’s business to determine if he and his children misstated the value of assets including golf courses and skyscrapers for over a decade. While a date for the family’s testimony has been set, that could change based on an appeals court’s decision. The Trumps have until Monday to ask the New York Court of Appeals to stay the order compelling their testimony, according to CNBC. The Trump family will give testimony separately in depositions that will not be held publicly, according to a stipulation filed in Manhattan court. Trump had tried to shut down the attorney general’s investigation by suing James in federal court, claiming her probe was politically motivated. But a U.S. district judge rejected that argument late last month and dismissed his suit. Trump was previously held in contempt in April for his refusal to provide documents to the attorney general. He ultimately had to pay a $110,000 fine for his refusal. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Trump And His Allies Prepare Alternative Reality Of Lies To Counter Jan. 6 Hearings,politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― As the bipartisan House Jan. 6 committee prepares to detail how Donald Trump tried to overthrow democracy to remain in power, the former president and his allies are preparing an alternative reality for his followers to inhabit. In this universe, the members of Trump’s mob who assaulted police officers and breached the Capitol, and are now being prosecuted for it, are actually “political prisoners.” The Jan. 6 committee ― which includes two Republican members, one of whom is the vice chair ― is a sham. And Trump himself did not do a single thing wrong. “The Jan. 6 hearings will be damning for Donald Trump,” said former Rep. David Jolly, who served in Congress as a Florida Republican. “Without counterprogramming, every Republican would have to address whether they can still defend the former president amidst new revelations of his culpability. The GOP counterprogramming is simply grade-school politics of deflection.” “Every time you see a Republican ‘counterprogram’ the hearings, you will see a Republican participating in Trump’s cover-up,” said Amanda Carpenter, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. “There will be bombshells, and every Republican who opposed the creation of the committee is a Republican who worked to prevent that information from ever becoming public.” Trump and his defenders ― whose lies about the 2020 election being “stolen” from him stoked anger among his millions of followers, anger that boiled over at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 ― are nevertheless continuing to spread those same lies as they mix in new ones about the committee hearings and Justice Department investigations. Matt Schlapp, who heads the Trump-aligned Conservative Political Action Conference and who personally helped spread Trump’s election lies in Nevada in the weeks following the 2020 election, wrote in a Wednesday Twitter post: “The 1/6 charade is more like a DNC convention than a congressional hearing.” That post linked to a Newsmax interview in which Schlapp defends two former top Trump aides who are being prosecuted for obstruction of Congress for defying committee subpoenas. “They were indicted because of their politics,” he said. Rep. Jim Jordan ― an Ohio Republican whose appointment to the committee was vetoed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi because of his role in spreading Trump’s post-election falsehoods ― published an op-ed Tuesday at The Federalist, a pro-Trump website, in which he claimed the true purpose of the hearings is to demonize conservatives. “Democrats want to use the violence of Jan. 6 to stigmatize conservative voices and delegitimize conservative ideals,” Jordan wrote. And at a news conference by House GOP leaders Wednesday, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana complained that Pelosi has not scheduled a prime-time hearing to address the issue of migrants coming across the Mexican border. “Nancy Pelosi continues to politicize Jan. 6,” he said. Former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a onetime colleague of Scalise, said the strategy is unsurprising. “This is just what they do. Fight back, distract, muddy the waters, confuse, lie,” said Walsh, who until 2020 identified as a Republican. “This is what they always do. And it works.” The Jan. 6 committee is planning a series of six public hearings, starting at 8 p.m. Thursday, to lay out Trump’s actions and statements that led to the violent attack on the Capitol, a last-ditch attempt to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s legitimate election win. All three major broadcast networks are carrying the hearing live, as are CNN and MSNBC on cable. Fox News, whose evening hosts acted as informal White House advisers during Trump’s presidency, is not carrying it. At 8 p.m., top-rated Tucker Carlson ― who months ago produced a “documentary” claiming that Jan. 6 was a false flag operation ― is scheduled to host his show as normal. The hearings are being relegated to Fox Business. “Fox is a pure propaganda outlet,” said Norman Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “It is clear that the last thing Republicans want is for their core audience to be exposed to a powerful reality that they have worked very hard to erase.” He added, though, that given that so many hard-line Republicans have become Trump true believers, the only meaningful audience for the committee is swing voters and low-propensity Democratic voters. “The audience is persuadable suburban voters and Democrats who need to be motivated into realizing that we face and continue to face an unprecedented existential threat,” Ornstein said. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first U.S. president in more than two centuries to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol killed five people, including one police officer; it also injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and has indicated he may run for president again in 2024.

12,Texas Congressman Blames Mass Shootings On 'Dang Smartphones',politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Although guns are, by definition, a part of every single mass shooting, many Republican politicians twist themselves into knots trying to blame them on something, anything other than firearms. On Wednesday, Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) came up with yet another cause of gun violence that doesn’t actually involve guns. If you’re reading this on your phone, you might want to sit down — because he’s blaming smartphones. During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday, Fallon rejected a call for new gun regulations by suggesting guns were around long before the relatively recent rash of mass shootings began. “Guns have always been readily available in this country but mass shootings and particularly mass shootings of schools were nonexistent or extremely rare until they became a grisly recent phenomenon,” Fallon told the committee. “So what’s changed in the last 50 years?” he asked, before offering his own theory. “There’s been a noticeable breakdown of the family, there’s been an erosion of faith and there’s been a seismic drop in social interaction in large measure due to the overuse of these dang smartphones and the proliferation of social media, which is probably better described as anti-social media,” he said while holding up his own device as a visual aid. Rep. Pat Fallon (R-TX) blamed mass shootings on ""the overuse of these dang smartphones."" pic.twitter.com/nFI0FsV5cT As mentioned above, Fallon isn’t the only person offering suggestions for reducing gun violence that don’t involve curbing guns ― especially in the wake of last month’s mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

13,Senate Candidate Blake Masters Accosts Democrat Wearing BLM Shirt At GOP Mixer,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Blake Masters, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Arizona, forcefully ejected a Democratic activist from a GOP mixer last weekend, according to video footage of the event. The incident took place at a meet-and-greet for Republican candidates in Green Valley, Arizona, on Saturday night. Peter Jackson, a 73-year-old Democratic activist, went to the event wearing a “Black Lives Matter” T-shirt and a button reading “fully vaxxed”; he was immediately confronted by those at the meeting, according to video footage uploaded to YouTube. The group began screaming at him to leave, calling him a “hypocrite” and telling him he was unwelcome. The footage then shows a woman filming Jackson with her cellphone before she strikes him in the face. The camera jostles and then Masters is seen rushing toward Jackson, grabbing him before he falls to his knees. Jackson is then ejected from the room and thrown to the ground; someone yells “Lock the door!” Another person then says he “hit a lady.” The footage did not appear to show Jackson striking anyone. The confrontation begins at the 3:09 mark in the video below. In a statement to local media, Masters confirmed he “intervened and put an end” to Jackson’s behavior. “A left-wing activist came to a Republican event, started harassing people, and then hit a woman,” Masters told Green Valley News in a statement. “I intervened and put an end to that. He was subsequently detained by the police and cited for assault. Let me be clear: if you come to an event I’m at and attack a woman, it’s going to be a bad day for you.” Masters did not immediately reply to a HuffPost request for comment. Jackson was cited after the brouhaha for trespassing and simple assault and is expected in court on June 23, Green Valley News reported. Masters, who is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, sparked fierce criticism this week after The Daily Beast re-upped comments he made claiming gun violence in America is largely a racial issue. “We do have a gun violence problem in this country, and it’s gang violence.” Masters told “The Jeff Oravits Show” podcast in April. “It’s people in Chicago, St. Louis shooting each other. Very often, you know, Black people, frankly.” The comments add to Masters nationalistic rhetoric, a label he’s owned and made part of his campaign. He’s also pushed the debunked “replacement theory” conspiracy, which purports Democrats and others in power are working to replace white voters with people of color via immigration policies. “Obviously, the Democrats, they hope to just change the demographics of our country,” he said on the “Patriot Edition” podcast late last month, per The Associated Press. “They hope to import an entirely new electorate. Then they call you a racist and a bigot.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,"GOP Leader On Passing Gun Safety Laws: Look, We Didn't Ban Airplanes After 9/11",politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Wednesday that passing gun safety legislation would be the wrong response to America’s constant mass shootings, because nobody tried to get rid of airplanes after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “I go back to September 11,” Scalise said at Republican leaders’ weekly press conference. “Because on that tragic day, the country made a clear realization that dots weren’t being connected. Terrorist attacks were happening, and the country didn’t have the right focus on the fundamental core problems that were creating those attacks.” “Airplanes were used that day as the weapon to kill thousands of people and to inflict terror on our country,” he said. “There wasn’t a conversation about banning airplanes.” It’s a ridiculous comparison to make: Weapons are not at all the same thing as commercial aircraft. Scalise also may have forgotten that a slew of new safety measures were put in place in response to 9/11 that transformed air travel into a radically different experience. Here’s a clip of Scalise’s remarks: ""Airplanes were used [on 9/11] ... There wasn't a conversation about banning airplanes.""— House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) pic.twitter.com/t4LwDfw8T7 The Louisiana Republican said the real solution to the nation’s epidemic of gun violence is about “connecting the dots” to stop shootings from happening. He listed some things he said Congress should focus on, instead of ― for example ― passing bills to make it harder for teenagers to have semi-automatic rifles, or expanding gun background checks, a proposal with near-universal support among Americans. “It’s things like hardening schools. It’s things like mental health counselors,” Scalise said, adding that it’s actually on children to help prevent mass shootings in their schools. “It’s things like helping teach other students the telltale signs, because we’ve seen in so many of these mass shootings, many students knew this was going to happen before this happened,” he said. “They knew that that student was going to do something.” Scalise glossed over the real reason the United States has so many mass shootings compared to virtually all other countries, which is not because of kids failing to report on peers who seem like they might be dangerous. The research is clear: The key factor is the astronomical number of guns in the United States, paired with some of the weakest controls over who can buy a gun and what kinds of guns you can own. Continuing on with remarks that seemed completely detached from reality, Scalise suggested that prayer in schools could also be a solution to stopping mass shootings. “You had AR-15s in the 1960s. You didn’t have those mass school shootings,” he said, ignoring the fact that the number of AR-15-style rifles in America has been growing exponentially since the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. “We actually had prayer in schools during those days. We had other things going on in our society where we took a different approach to our young kids. Let’s look at that.” “These are tough conversations that we should be having that we’re not having,” added Scalise, who then refused to answer reporters’ repeated questions about whether he supports bare-minimum gun safety measures like so-called red flag laws. Scalise, who was himself shot in 2017, is pushing back against the idea of passing gun safety legislation during a week when Congress appears poised, finally, to do something in response to recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York. The House is planning to vote on a mix of gun safety bills, including measures to raise the age for buying AR-15s from 18 to 21 and to require gun owners to register homemade firearms through the federal background check system. But none of the House proposals are expected to move in the Senate, so a more pressing question is what kind of meager, GOP-backed legislation can possibly move in the upper chamber and then pass in the House. The bipartisan Senate package currently being hashed out includes provisions that would narrowly expand gun background checks, enhance school safety, incentivize states to implement red flag laws, and provide resources for new mental health programs.

15,Senate Confirms Biden Court Pick Who Freed Dozens Of Innocent People From Prison,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Nina Morrison to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, putting someone onto the federal bench with the extraordinary background of having worked to free dozens of innocent people from prison and death row. Morrison was confirmed in a 53-46 vote to her lifetime federal judgeship. Every Democrat voted for her, along with three Republicans: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.). Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) did not vote. Morrison, 52, has spent the last 20 years being the senior litigation counsel at the New York-based Innocence Project, an organization focused on exonerating wrongly convicted people through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system. She has been lead or co-counsel on cases that have freed more than 30 innocent people from prison. During her confirmation hearing in February, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee bizarrely attacked Morrison as if she had committed the crimes her clients had been convicted of — that they didn’t actually commit, either. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), both potential 2024 presidential contenders who have used the committee’s hearings for grandstanding, tried to blame Morrison for spikes in violent crimes in cities across America. They pressed her on whether she felt guilty about freeing people from prison who had been convicted of violent crimes, despite the fact that they had all been exonerated by DNA evidence. “Across this country, Americans are horrified at skyrocketing crime rates, at skyrocketing homicide rates, at skyrocketing burglary rates, at skyrocketing carjacking rates,” Cruz told Morrison. “All of those are the direct result of the policies you’ve spent your entire lifetime advancing.” “I will oppose you and anyone else the administration sends to us who do not understand the necessity of the rule of law,” Hawley vowed, nonsensically. Easily the biggest fail of the hearing, though, was when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tried to shame Morrison for her work on a case involving an Arkansas man, Ledell Lee, who was put to death in 2017 for the 1993 murder of a 26-year-old woman, Debra Reese. Four years after he was executed, a different man’s DNA was found on the murder weapon, which had not previously been tested. Morrison had taken up the case on behalf of Lee’s sister. Cotton, also a potential 2024 presidential contender, appeared stunned that Morrison was examining this case so many years later — and did not seem to understand the significance and reliability of DNA testing. “He was convicted on the basis of eyewitness testimony and the possession of Ms. Reese’s stolen property,” Cotton insisted. “Eyewitness identification, which you referenced, is actually the single leading proven cause of wrongful convictions,” Morrison replied, noting that there is “a significant amount of compelling evidence” in favor of Lee’s innocence. “Compelling evidence that courts somehow overlooked for 22 years until he was executed?” interrupted Cotton, seemingly exasperated that Morrison actually knew what she was talking about. “Senator, I have represented many individuals who were exonerated by DNA who lost dozens of appeals in courts because DNA was not available,” Morrison said. Cotton resorted to trying to make Morrison feel guilty for taking on the case at all. “As he walked to the execution chamber, on the night of his execution, he looked at a warden and smirked, and said, ‘This ain’t happening. You all are taking me back,’” Cotton said. “Are you proud that you encouraged such defiance of convicted murderers?” “Senator, I don’t believe that anything in my career has ever encouraged defiance or disrespect for the process,” Morrison calmly replied. “I know that Mr. Lee maintained his actual innocence until his execution.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,Louisiana Becomes Latest State To Ban Transgender Athletes In Schools,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Louisiana has become the latest state to ban transgender girls from participating in sports in public schools after the state’s Democratic governor declined to veto it, arguing that such an attempt would be futile against the state’s Republican-controlled legislature. Gov. John Bel Edwards, who vetoed a nearly identical bill last year, called the legislation “unfortunate” and “distressing” but said it would have become law whether or not he signed it. “I’ve allowed that bill to become law without my signature, not because I thought the bill was good,” Edwards said at a press conference Monday. “I hope we can all get to a point soon where we realize that these young people are doing the very best that they can to survive. I just think that we can be better than that bill.” In Louisiana, any bill passed by the state’s legislature becomes law if the governor doesn’t take action on it within the constitutionally prescribed time period. The bill had more than two-thirds majority support in both chambers of the state legislature, which would be enough for a veto override. But that’s assuming lawmakers don’t change their initial vote during an override attempt, which happens. Edwards was narrowly able to veto last year’s bill because a few members of the House changed their initial votes of support for the bill, The Advocate reported. The legislation adds Louisiana to a list of 18 other states that have passed similar legislation over supposed concerns that transgender athletes could have an unfair physical advantage. Edwards called that fear made-up and purposefully harmful to members of the LGBTQ community. “In the year since that bill was first put on my desk, there still hasn’t been a single instance in Louisiana of a trans girl participating in sports,” Edwards countered while addressing the media Monday. He said the bill is designed to “send a strong message to at least some of these young people that they shouldn’t be who they think they are, who they believe they are, who they know they are. And I find that very distressing. I do believe that we can be better than that. And we shouldn’t pretend that there’s unfairness when there’s not. It’s not happening in Louisiana.” Republican state Sen. Beth Mizell, who sponsored the legislation both years, expressed joy at the bill’s passage, posting on Facebook: “Hallelujah!” “I’m really pleased that we finally got it over the finish line,” she told The Advocate. The Human Rights Campaign and The Trevor Project, two organizations that support LGBTQ rights, condemned Edwards’ inaction in statements Tuesday. “Governor Edwards’ decision betrays his LGBTQ+ constituents and fails the transgender youth who were counting on his leadership,” HRC state legislative director and senior counsel Cathryn Oakley said in a statement. “The radical politicians that engineered this bill are targeting kids who just want to play sports for the same reason all students do ― to learn the values of teamwork, to face healthy competition, and to have fun. These children were failed by their leaders.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Ron DeSantis' Press Secretary Registers As Foreign Agent Following DOJ Notification,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Christina Pushaw, the press secretary of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), has registered as a foreign agent who worked for former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili from 2018 to 2020, upon a Department of Justice request. Michael Sherwin, Pushaw’s lawyer, told The Washington Post Pushaw’s responsibilities included writing op-eds, reaching out to supporters and “advocating on his behalf in Georgia and in the United States.” “The work ended in 2020,” Sherwin told the Post. “Ms. Pushaw was notified recently by the DOJ that her work on behalf of Mr. Saakashvili likely required FARA registration. Ms. Pushaw filed for the registration retroactively as soon as she was made aware.” Sherwin added that Pushaw originally worked on a voluntary basis and made about $25,000 in total over the two years. Pushaw has been DeSantis’ press secretary since May 2021. The Foreign Agents Registration Act, established in 1938, is intended to provide transparency both to Americans and their lawmakers about who is behind efforts to exert influence. “The statute requires persons working on behalf of foreign governments or other foreign principals (including Americans) to disclose their relationships to foreign principals and information about their activities,” states a document on the Department of Justice website, explaining FARA. “Agents who fail to register are violating federal law, and they can be prosecuted if their failure is deliberate.” Last month, the DOJ sued American businessman and hotelier Steve Wynn because he refused multiple requests from the Justice Department to register as a foreign agent for his work on behalf of the Chinese government in 2017, under President Donald Trump’s administration. “Where a foreign government uses an American as its agent to influence policy decisions in the United States, FARA gives the American people a right to know,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, according to the press release announcing the lawsuit. This is not the first time Pushaw has made headlines. In August 2021, Pushaw had her Twitter account briefly suspended for violating rules around “abusive behavior” after she wrote “drag them” while retweeting an Associated Press reporter’s article revealing one of DeSantis’ donors had invested in the COVID drug Regeneron, which the governor had been promoting. The writer of the piece subsequently received death threats. In January 2022, Pushaw refused to condemn a neo-Nazi rally in Florida, saying it was instead a Democratic “stunt” to reflect poorly on her boss.

2,Uvalde Pediatrician Lets Congress Have It During Powerful Testimony,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The pediatrician who treated juvenile gunshot victims after the elementary school mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, castigated Congress for allowing teenagers to buy guns. During testimony on Wednesday as lawmakers consider new legislation on gun violence, Dr. Roy Guerrero described treating children who’d been shot by an 18-year-old gunman and seeing the decapitated bodies of children who had been torn apart by bullets from an assault rifle. Guerrero said he became a pediatrician partly because children are good patients who listen to medical advice, whereas adults are stubborn to change even if it will make them better. “Why else would there have been such little progress made in Congress to stop gun violence? Innocent children all over the country today are dead because laws and policy allows people to buy weapons before they’re legally even old enough to buy a pack of beer,” Guerrero said. “They are dead because restrictions have been allowed to lapse,” Guerrero said, referring to the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. “They’re dead because there are no rules about where guns are kept. Because no one is paying attention to who is buying them.” The Uvalde gunman murdered 19 elementary school students and two teachers using an assault rifle he legally purchased days after his 18th birthday. Federal law allows 18-year-olds to purchase shotguns and rifles from licensed gun dealers while restricting handgun sales to people 21 and older. House Democrats plan to vote on a package of gun legislation later Wednesday that would include a bill raising the minimum age for most shotguns and rifles, but the bills won’t clear the Senate. A bipartisan group of senators, however, is negotiating on a more modest package of reforms that could include improvements to the background check system for licensed gun sales, funding for mental health and incentives for states to pass “red flag” laws to confiscate guns from people who are deemed dangerous. Senate Democrats have pushed for raising the age for assault rifles to 21, but Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told HuffPost on Tuesday that Republicans would probably tank the whole package if it raised the age. Guerrero said the AR-style rifle used in Uvalde left the killer’s victims unrecognizable. “Two children, whose bodies had been so pulverized by the bullets fired at them, over and over again, whose flesh had been so ripped apart, that the only clue as to their identities were the blood spattered cartoon clothes still clinging to them,” Guerrero said.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off.

Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one.

Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor.

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,Man With A Gun Arrested Near Brett Kavanaugh's Home,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost A man police say was carrying a gun, a knife and pepper spray outside Brett Kavanaugh’s home has been arrested after he told authorities he wanted to kill the Supreme Court justice. Police told The Washington Post that the man, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, did not make it onto the Maryland property and was stopped on a nearby street. A Supreme Court spokesperson confirmed the report, telling SCOTUSblog in a statement, “At approximately 1:50 a.m. today, a man was arrested near Justice Kavanaugh’s residence. The man was armed and made threats against Justice Kavanaugh. He was transported to Montgomery County Police 2nd District.” The man reportedly took a taxi to the area and called 911 himself, telling the dispatcher he’d traveled from California, was having suicidal and homicidal thoughts, and had an unloaded gun with him in a locked case. Officers took the man, identified in a criminal complaint Wednesday afternoon as Nicholas John Roske, into custody without incident. According to the complaint, Roske told detectives he “was upset about the leak of a recent Supreme Court draft decision regarding the right to abortion as well as the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.” He also told detectives he thought killing the justice would give his life purpose. Roske was charged Wednesday in federal court with attempting to murder a Supreme Court justice. Federal agents in unmarked cars were seen parked outside the residence Wednesday morning. “This kind of behavior is obviously behavior that we will not tolerate,” Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters. “Threats of violence and actual violence against the justices of course strike at the heart of our democracy, and we will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable.” Kavanaugh’s home, along with the homes of other Supreme Court justices, was the site of protests last month after a leaked draft opinion from the court indicated it intends to overturn Roe v. Wade. National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Topless Abortion Rights Protesters Storm Court At New York Liberty WNBA Game,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Topless advocates for abortion rights stormed the court Tuesday during the New York Liberty-Minnesota Lynx WNBA game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn to protest the possible repeal of Roe v. Wade. They had messages like “Hell no!” and “My Body, My Choice” written on their torsos. Other protesters in the stands held signs that read, “Overturn Roe? Hell no!” and “Abortion on demand & without apology.” Many protesters who interrupted play appeared to have their breasts painted over. This wasn't to protest the game or players, but to call on YOU to #RiseUp4AbortionRights NOW!Yes we know most people here support #abortionrights. NOW SAVE THEM! GET OFF THE SIDELINES & INTO THE STREETS! Bring society 2 a halt. Stop the Supreme Court from Overturning #RoeVWade! pic.twitter.com/zXN896ZeQV Security eventually ushered out the activists, who later were photographed outside the arena. The women apparently represented Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, which has staged protests at Dodger Stadium and at televangelist Joel Osteen’s church recently. “This was the audience we wanted,” the group wrote in a tweet, apparently referring to the women-friendly crowd at the game. This was the audience we wanted. We aren't protesting to change the hearts & minds of woman-hating fascists. No. We are calling on those who can stop the overturning of #RoeVWade: THE MILLIONS of ppl who support #abortionrights. YOU! No business as usual. Shut the country down! pic.twitter.com/2HvCTfNIti No charges were filed, the New York Police Department told the New York Post. The defense of reproductive rights has intensified since a leak indicated that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, which protects a woman’s right to an abortion. “I’m all for the message,” Liberty player Rebecca Allen told ESPN after the Barclays Center protest. “And I’m happy that we were able to log back into the game and continue playing.” Teammate Sabrina Ionescu thought the protesters were entertainers at first. “It took me a little bit of time to process,” she said, per the sports network. “It was a little crazy.

12,Anti-Trump GOP Group's Scathing Ad Urges Everyone To Watch Jan. 6 Hearings,politics," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Fox News said it won’t air the Jan. 6 hearings live on Thursday evening, but one conservative group is urging all Americans to watch the event just the same. The Republican Accountability Project, an organization of conservatives opposed to former President Donald Trump, released a new ad promoting the hearings by the bipartisan House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol. “A lie drove the attack,” the ad states. “Now, it’s time to learn the truth.” The group said the spot will run on TV during local news as well as online in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ― states where Trump and his supporters tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost. “Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election lit the spark that caused the January 6 attack,” Sarah Longwell, the group’s executive director, said in a news release. “It’s time for the American people to hear the truth.” In the past few months, the Republican Accountability Project has released a series of ads going after Trump’s biggest enablers within the GOP, and has vowed to work against their reelection.

13,Karen Bass And Rick Caruso Advance In Los Angeles Mayoral Race,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Karen Bass and Rick Caruso will progress to Los Angeles’ mayoral race this fall after claiming the top two spots in Tuesday’s nonpartisan primary, setting the stage for a heated battle over the direction of a city at a major inflection point. The candidates, both running as Democrats, beat out 10 other mayoral hopefuls, including City Councilman Kevin de León and activist Gina Viola. Bass, a community organizer who’s represented Los Angeles in the U.S. House of Representatives for over a decade, and Caruso, a billionaire real estate developer who’s served on several government commissions, will both try to sell Angelenos this November on their readiness to tackle the city’s seemingly insurmountable homelessness crisis, a recent uptick in violent crime and the politics of a COVID-19 pandemic that just won’t go away. One of them will replace Mayor Eric Garcetti, who’s being forced out by term limits and hopes to be confirmed as the next ambassador to India. Bass, one of the country’s prominent Black female politicians who was a finalist on President Joe Biden’s shortlist of running mates, represents the liberal Democratic establishment in many ways but has promised innovation in solving LA’s homelessness crisis, which is one of the most serious in the country. That includes using her connections in Washington to secure more federal housing vouchers and addressing the policy failures that have left so people homeless in the first place, she’s said. Housing activists say Bass is uniquely qualified to help the city’s homeless population, which comprises more than 40,000 individuals. While working as a physician assistant in the 1980s, Bass began organizing a response to the crack epidemic in South Los Angeles and successfully secured millions in government funding to help communities affected by the crisis. In her mayoral campaign, she’s vowed to put resources toward those struggling with addiction, mental illness and homelessness instead of prosecuting them. But Bass’s plan to deploy hundreds of new police officers has created tension between her and the city’s more progressive wing, including leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement. She says she plans to house 15,000 people in her first year in office if elected. “If you tell me that you want to build housing for the homeless, you go to the front of the line,” Bass said in April. “You should not have to stand in line with somebody that is building luxury housing. We don’t need any more luxury housing, in my opinion, in the Los Angeles area.” That’s a not-so-subtle dig at Caruso, who made his name developing high-end shopping centers and planned residential communities. This isn’t his first foray into government: He’s served as commissioner for the city’s Department of Water and Power, a member of the city’s Coliseum Commission and president of the city’s Board of Police Commissioners. Caruso, who was registered as a Republican three years ago and only registered as a Democrat right before announcing his mayoral campaign, often touts the city’s 30% drop in crime when he led the police commission in the early 2000s. Though critics say he’s overstating his role in that era’s falling crime rates, his position has resonated with plenty of voters, who catapulted him to the front of the race in the weeks leading up to the primary. Spending more than $30 million to flood the airwaves with ads certainly hasn’t hurt him, either. That staggering amount totals more than ten times the spending of the entire Bass campaign. In his pledges to voters, Caruso says he hopes to deploy around 1,500 new police officers and build 30,000 new shelter beds within a year. “I’m going to make L.A. more livable,” Caruso told The New York Times recently. “We’re going to have cleaner streets and better parks, and we’re going to have lower crime. And you’re going to be able to go for a walk and not worry about it.” He’s earned the support of some vocal celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow and Snoop Dogg. Bass, meanwhile, boasts endorsements from Ariana Grande, Shonda Rhimes and Steven Spielberg. The two will face off in the general election on Nov. 8.

15,San Francisco's Progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin Recalled By Voters,politics," Reporter, HuffPost San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was projected to be recalled by voters Tuesday, a loss for progressives who supported his mission of criminal justice reform. If Boudin is removed from his position as top prosecutor of the majority-Democratic city, Mayor London Breed will appoint an interim DA until voters weigh in again in the November election. Boudin was elected in 2019 as part of a movement of progressive prosecutors across the country — including Larry Krasner in Philadelphia — pushing back on decades of tough-on-crime policies that increased mass incarceration and disproportionately criminalized Black and Latinx people. Since entering office, Boudin — a former public defender whose parents spent decades in prison — has kept his campaign promises of eliminating cash bail, holding police accountable and diverting people from the criminal legal system. The recall effort was led by an organization called San Franciscans for Public Safety, which gathered over 50,000 signatures to put the recall on the ballot. The group has claimed that crime is on the rise in the city and blamed the progressive DA. But a San Francisco Chronicle analysis found that violent crime in San Francisco actually declined during the pandemic. While murders and shootings have increased in recent years, this tracks with trends across major U.S. cities. Most property crimes are also trending toward their pre-pandemic levels. The recall was funded by wealthy donors, including William Oberndorf, a Republican megadonor. The Northern California American Civil Liberties Union and local union chapters of the SEIU supported Boudin with donations against the recall campaign. Some of Boudin’s critics pointed to growing anti-Asian violence over the past two years in San Francisco, but such hateful attacks occurred in cities across the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Boudin’s team slammed the recall effort as a political tool being used to reverse a fairly won election. State legislators have pushed to reform the recall system in California, with state Sen. Steve Glazer (D) telling HuffPost last year that voters want “a more democratic process” that “prevents political gamesmanship.” Last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom prevailed against an effort to recall him from his seat. But earlier this year, three school board members were successfully recalled from their posts — the first recall in San Francisco since 1983.

16,Jesse Watters 'Self-Owns' With Jab At White House For Hosting Matthew McConaughey,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Fox News’ Jesse Watters was called out Tuesday after he mocked the White House for hosting actor Matthew McConaughey to speak about gun control. “What are the White House going to do now? They going to put Tom Cruise out to talk inflation?” he said. McConaughey, who was born in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 kids and two teachers were massacred in a May 24 school shooting, was arguably a relevant celebrity to speak to the issue. He had argued for more responsible gun laws in the past, and he stood at the White House lectern on Tuesday to call for reforms to gun legislation in the wake of the attack in his hometown. And as Twitter user and media observer @acyn promptly noted, Watters actually discussed inflation with a celebrity guest himself not long ago. In a widely mocked segment in April, the Fox News host chatted to reality TV star DJ Pauly D about the rising cost of living. “What are we doing about this inflation? Does Joe Biden understand how much this is killing this country?” he asked the “Jersey Shore” alum as the chyron “DJ Pauly D on inflation” appeared on screen.

1,Iowa Democrat Franken Wins Primary To Face Grassley In Senate Race,politics," DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Democrat Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral, will face Republican Chuck Grassley in the race for an Iowa U.S. Senate seat, winning his party nomination Tuesday over two competitors. Franken beat former congresswoman Abby Finkenauer and physician Glenn Hurst and earned the right to run against Grassley, who is seeking an eighth Senate term and beat back a nominal primary challenge of his own on Tuesday. Franken’s primary win is something of a surprise, given Finkenauer was better known throughout the state after her 2018 victory over a Republican congressman that made her the second-youngest woman elected to Congress. Finkenauer lost in a reelection bid in 2020 but was a frequent presence on cable television and raised millions of dollars toward her Senate run. In his campaign, Franken emphasized a need to “dial down the political tension” in Washington. He also called for adding a public insurance option to the Affordable Care Act. Joyce Mahl of Council Bluffs in western Iowa said she voted for Franken because she was unsure Iowans would vote for a Democratic woman in the general election, though Iowa has elected Democratic women, including Finkenauer, to Congress. Mahl’s top priority is a candidate she views as stronger against Grassley. “If you want Grassley out, you’ve got to vote for the one that you think can beat him,” Mahl, 66, said after voting at a downtown Council Bluffs church. Franken will nonetheless face stiff headwinds going into the general election against Grassley, who has served seven terms. A state that Democrat Barack Obama won in two presidential elections has steadily shifted to the right in recent years, part of a broader transformation that has spread through the Northern Plains that has made it increasingly difficult for Democrats to compete statewide. A well-known state lawmaker before she served a single term in the U.S. House, Finkenauer is one of the most prominent Democrats in Iowa. Mark Hollander, 47, a marketing professional from West Des Moines said he voted for Abby Finkenauer in part because of her background in Congress, but also because she represents a new generation. Finkenauer stressed limiting the number of terms a member of the Senate can serve. “I do agree with her on term limits,” Hollander said. “I feel that Grassley has not been especially effective in the last decade-plus and has turned more obstructionist at this point.” But Finkenauer’s campaign faced an unexpected stumble in April when she nearly didn’t make the primary ballot. Republican activists claimed she hadn’t gathered enough signatures from enough counties. A district judge ruled Finkenauer hadn’t qualified for the ballot, a ruling she called “deeply partisan.” The Iowa Supreme Court overruled that decision and allowed her to run. Still, the episode turned off a number of veteran state Democratic activists, former candidates and officeholders, prompting some to give Franken a second look. He posted stronger first-quarter fundraising figures than Finkenauer and earned endorsements from some well-known former Finkenauer supporters bothered by her declining to accept responsibility for the filing mistakes. Grassley, from New Hartford in northern Iowa, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980 after serving three terms in the U.S. House. __ Associated Press writers David Pitt in West Des Moines, Iowa, and Grant Schulte in Council Bluffs, Iowa, contributed to this report.

2,"Jan. 6 Hearings To Lead Off With First Police Officer Injured, Moviemaker Who Filmed Riot",politics," Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The first police officer injured by Donald Trump’s mob on Jan. 6, 2021, and a documentary filmmaker who captured footage of the U.S. Capitol assault’s key participants will be the lead-off witnesses Thursday night in the first public hearing by the House select committee investigating the attack. Caroline Edwards of the U.S. Capitol Police force suffered a “traumatic brain injury,” according to the House Jan. 6 committee, but continued patrolling the Capitol’s west plaza. Her injuries nearly a year and a half later continue to prevent her from returning to work, the committee said in a statement. Also testifying is Nick Quested, a British filmmaker who was documenting the movements of the right-wing Proud Boys group ― several of whom were charged with seditious conspiracy Monday for ginning up the attack for the purpose of preventing the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden. Quested filmed “the first moments of violence against U.S. Capitol Police, and the chaos that ensued,” the committee said. He had been following Proud Boys leaders in the days leading up to Jan. 6 and caught on film a parking garage meeting the previous evening between that group’s Enrique Tarrio and the head of another pro-Trump extremist group, the Oath Keepers. The bipartisan House panel has been working nearly a full year, almost entirely behind closed doors. It has taken statements and depositions from more than a thousand people and gathered more than a hundred thousand pages of documents. Committee members have said the series of hearings over the next two weeks will lay out how Trump and his allies tried to overturn the results of the presidential election so that he could remain in power. Committee vice chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, told CBS News on Sunday that the extent of the conspiracy was frightening. “It is extremely broad. It’s extremely well-organized. It’s really chilling,” she said. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and by 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― led to the deaths of five people, including one police officer, the injury of 140 additional officers and the deaths by suicide of four other police officers. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.

3,Fox Host Calls Uvalde Native Matthew McConaughey 'Someone From Hollywood',politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Fox News host Sandra Smith seemed to take an offhand swipe at Texan actor Matthew McConaughey Tuesday after his impassioned plea for commonsense gun laws from the White House podium. “Really interesting to hear him say there, someone from Hollywood calling to restore our family values in the wake of that mass shooting at that elementary school in Texas,” she said. McConaughey was born and raised in Texas and lives in Austin with his wife. He recently mulled a run for governor of the state. Smith did note that the actor was born in Uvalde, where 19 schoolchildren and two teachers were killed  last month by a gunman armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle, but later made the comment about his ability to hold “family values” because he worked in Hollywood. “He wants to raise the age for buying an assault rifle to 21 years old unless you’re in the military. He says all gun purchases should require a background check and red flag laws should be law of the land,” Smith said. Fox News host Sandra Smith dismisses McConaughey's heart-wrenching call for gun control: ""Someone from Hollywood calling to restore our family values."" pic.twitter.com/msm8yc09dt After a clip of the moment circulated and garnered backlash, Smith characterized her comments about McConaughey as praise. However, as many viewers commented, her tone had seemed to indicate otherwise.

He stressed the importance of gun control laws, including background checks, red flag laws that would allow law enforcement to confiscate guns from those deemed a danger to themselves or others, raising the minimum age of purchase and having a waiting period for firearms, such as AR-15 rifles. “As divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don’t. ... This should not be a partisan issue. There is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of the shooters,” he said. Though polling indicates a large majority of Americans support a universal background check law for all firearm sales, Senate Republicans aren’t willing to vote on the legislation currently before them that would put those checks in place.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off.

Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone.

Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one.

Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen.

Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,Abortion Rights Protesters Interrupt Joel Osteen's Church Service,politics," Associate Reporter, HuffPost Members of a national abortion rights organization protested at Joel Osteen’s megachurch as the nation braces for the Supreme Court to potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling legalizing abortion nationally. The footage of the Sunday demonstration at Lakewood Church in Houston, posted on Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights’ Twitter account, shows three protesters removing most of their clothes and yelling, “It’s my body, my f**king choice,” after Osteen closed out his morning prayer. One woman in the trio shouted, “Overturn Roe, hell no,” while another shouted, “I am who I say I am; I do what I say I can do because I have a choice!” before ushers escorted them out of the church. BREAKING @lakewoodchurch service disrupted by @tx4abortion activists determined to STOP SCOTUS from taking away abortion rights declared ABORTION ON DEMAND AND WITHOUT APOLOGY! As they were removed they chanted MY BODY MY CHOICE! Overturn Roe? Hell No! https://t.co/Y0oCPlHcsr pic.twitter.com/aTvGfwthlB Osteen is one of the nation’s most recognized evangelists, amassing 45,000 attendees at Lakewood Church every week. Coco Das, an organizer for Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, told HuffPost the group protested at the megachurch on behalf of church members who believe abortion rights shouldn’t be taken away. “Our nonviolent actions weren’t against [Osteen] or Lakewood Church,” Das said. “We wanted to wake people up across the nation and the world. We are challenging people to rise up and take action against these dangerous measures.” The activist group’s protest comes on the heels of a leaked draft opinion, published by Politico in May, suggesting that the Supreme Court will overturn the monumental ruling. The court is expected to hand down its official decision in the coming weeks. Overturning Roe v. Wade will have an immediate ripple effect across the country for people looking to terminate their pregnancies, since at least 26 states are likely or certain to ban abortion as soon as the ruling is dismantled.

11,Uvalde School Police Chief A No-Show At First City Council Meeting,politics," UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The school district police chief criticized for waiting too long before ordering law enforcement to confront and kill the gunman during a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school did not appear at a City Council meeting in Uvalde on Tuesday, despite being newly elected to the panel. Mayor Don McLaughlin said he was unable to explain why the district police Chief Pete Arredondo wasn’t at the brief meeting. Two weeks ago, 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. Law enforcement and state officials have struggled to present an accurate timeline and details, and have stopped releasing information about the police response. McLaughlin told reporters at the meeting that he was frustrated with the lack of information. “We want facts and answers, just like everybody else,” the mayor said. Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said Arredondo, who was in charge of the multi-agency response on May 24, made the “wrong decision” to not order officers to breach the classroom more quickly to confront the gunman. As the mayor spoke in Uvalde on Tuesday, lawmakers in Washington heard testimony from the son of a woman who was killed in a recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, as lawmakers work toward a bipartisan agreement on gun safety measures. And at a White House press briefing, actor Matthew McConaughey, a Uvalde native, spoke with passion about his conversations with the families of the children who were killed and the need for more stringent gun control. The gunman, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, spent roughly 80 minutes inside Robb Elementary, and more than an hour passed from when the first officers followed him into the building and when he was killed, according to an official timeline. In the meantime, parents outside begged police to rush in and panicked children called 911 from inside. Arredondo has not responded to repeated interview requests and questions from The Associated Press. After the City Council meeting, Alfred Garza III, whose 10-year-old daughter, Amerie Jo, was among the Uvalde students killed, told reporters that he attended the meeting to see what else he could learn about what happened that day. “I have so many questions and not every one can be answered. They’re still collecting data, they’re still collecting information on what happened,” Garza said. He said he had been curious as to whether Arredondo would attend the meeting, and said he had “mixed feelings” about the district police chief’s absence. “He obviously didn’t show up for a reason,” Garza said, adding that he assumed Arredondo thought if he did appear he would get a lot of questions. Garza said he doesn’t have “a lot of ill will” toward Arredondo, nor does he blame just one person for what happened, but he does think more could have been done that day. “They did take a long time to get in there,” Garza said. Since the shooting, there have been tensions between state and local authorities over how police handled the shooting and communicated what happened to the public. The Texas Department of Public Safety has begun referring questions about the investigation to the Uvalde-area district attorney, Christina Mitchell Busbee. She hasn’t responded to repeated interview requests and questions from AP. McLaughlin said he has asked officials for a briefing but “we’re not getting it.” He said the city’s police chief was on vacation at the time of the shooting and that the acting city police commander was on the scene. ___ More on the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas: https://apnews.com/hub/uvalde-school-shooting ___ Stengle reported from Dallas.

12,Banning Teenagers From Buying AR-15s Runs Into Wall Of GOP Resistance,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Bipartisan gun talks in the Senate have focused on fairly narrow measures: funding for mental health, enhanced background checks, “red flag” laws and school security. The talks started in the wake of two mass shootings in which the accused gunmen are 18-year-olds who legally purchased their assault rifles. But raising the minimum age required to buy an AR-15-style weapon seems like a long shot because of Republican opposition. “Two circuit courts have held that unconstitutional,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost. “I don’t know what the Supreme Court would do. But I think we’re more interested in trying to target people with mental health and criminal backgrounds. “ Just three years ago, Congress raised the age limit for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, and doing the same for guns has emerged as one obvious response to the back-to-back high-profile mass shootings by teenagers. Payton Gendron, 18, has been charged in the deaths of 10 people at a market in Buffalo, New York, on May 14. Salvador Ramos, also 18, is accused of killing 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school on May 24 in Uvalde, Texas. Actor Matthew McConaughey, a Uvalde native who recently flirted with running for Texas governor, this week endorsed the idea before meeting with senators on Capitol Hill. Federal law restricts handgun sales by licensed dealers to buyers 21 and up while allowing 18-year-olds to buy shotguns and rifles. But Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn), who has led the negotiations for Democrats, acknowledged that raising the gun-buying age would be difficult. “We’re doing the hard work of exploring what can get us 60-plus votes,” Murphy told HuffPost, referring to the level of support needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. “Obviously, I support raising the age. I’m just not sure that that ultimately gets us the number we need to get to.” The members of the bipartisan group are hoping to craft a deal they can present to their parties by the end of the week, though that timeline may slip. Cornyn, the lead GOP negotiator, updated his colleagues on the status of the talks at a private caucus lunch on Tuesday. Although raising the age required to buy an assault rifle was among the ideas on the list he presented, Cornyn did not state his preference for one idea over another, according to several attendees. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also declined to state a position on the age limit when asked by a reporter following the lunch on Tuesday. “We are waiting to see if we can get an outcome that directly relates to the problem that brought this issue to the floor one more time,” McConnell said. “I personally would prefer to get an outcome, and we hope that we will have one soon.” Republicans are for the most part standing back when it comes to supporting anything in a possible bipartisan gun reform package. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he might be open to raising the buying age but was concerned about legal challenges like the one to Florida’s law requiring gun buyers to be 21. “I’m not an outright ‘no,’ but I need to learn more about whether it’s going to get struck down in court,” Rubio said. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said he’s “not convinced proposals like that are actually going to reduce violence” when asked about a higher gun-buying age. “I’m looking for ways here to keep our kids safe in school. So I think protecting our schools is the direction where I head. Some of these increased gun control provisions I don’t see are going to make our schools safer,” he added. Asked about a waiting period for gun purchases by people under 21, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pivoted to a totally unrelated topic. “I think what we ought to do is enforce the laws we already have, by the way, in a justice system that applies the law equally,” Johnson said. “Before we pass anything new, let’s enforce the laws we already have. Let’s start with Hunter Biden.” Some GOP moderates, such as Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, left the door open to supporting such a proposal. At least seven more Republicans would need to join them to make it a reality. In an emotional speech at the White House on Tuesday, McConaughey called for new regulations as part of what he called a “gun responsibility” platform that he outlined earlier this week. “We want secure and safe schools, and we want gun laws that won’t make it so easy for the bad guys to get the damn guns,” McConaughey, who is a gun owner, said after recalling heart-wrenching conversations he’s had with the victims’ families in Uvalde.

13,Outraged Matthew McConaughey Begs For Commonsense Gun Laws At White House,politics," Reporter, HuffPost A visibly shaken Matthew McConaughey addressed the American people from the White House podium Tuesday, pleading for the passage of commonsense gun laws in the wake of a shooter slaughtering 19 children and two teachers in his hometown of Uvalde, Texas. The actor spoke for more than 20 minutes straight, sharing the heart-wrenching conversations he’s had with the victims’ families, whom he and his wife went to meet as soon as they learned of the May 24 massacre. The budding conservationist Maite Yuleana Rodriguez, a 10-year-old killed in the shooting, will never get to work toward her dream of becoming a marine biologist, McConaughey lamented. She liked to wear a pair of green Converse shoes with a heart on the toe ― an emblem she drew to symbolize her love of nature. His wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, held the shoes in her lap nearby as he spoke. Matthew @McConaughey's wife Camilla holds green high-top Converse shoes of the one of the Uvalde, TX victims.""These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting."" pic.twitter.com/uImP8xutsn “That turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting,” McConaughey said, slamming his fist on the podium so hard that White House employees later checked to see if he’d left a dent. The large wounds left by AR-15-style rifles, which the shooter used, mutilate bodies so badly that “only DNA tests or green Converse” could be used to identify the deceased, McConaughey said. The one message he heard repeatedly from the victims’ families, he said, was that they wanted their loved ones’ lives to matter. Doing that, McConaughey argued, requires passing “reasonable, practical, tactical regulations” around firearms. “We need responsible gun ownership. We need background checks. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 rifle to 21. We need a waiting period for those rifles. We need red flag laws and consequences for those who abuse them,” said McConaughey, who’s considered a run for Texas governor in the past. Though the vast majority of Americans support a universal background check law for all firearm transactions, no Republicans in Congress are willing to vote on the legislation currently before them. The bill, H.R. 8, would close a loophole that lets unlicensed and private firearm sellers, such as those making transactions online or at gun shows, skip background checks. “As divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don’t. It really is. ... This should not be a partisan issue. There is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of the shooters,” McConaughey asserted Tuesday. “We’ve got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations,” he continued, “a chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Feds Warn Of Increased Domestic Extremist Threat As Midterms Approach,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — A looming Supreme Court decision on abortion, an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and the midterm elections are potential triggers for extremist violence over the next six months, the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday. The U.S. was in a “heightened threat environment” already, and these factors may worsen the situation, DHS said in the latest National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin. “In the coming months, we expect the threat environment to become more dynamic as several high-profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets,” DHS said. It’s the latest attempt by Homeland Security to draw attention to the threat posed by domestic violent extremism, a shift from alerts about international terrorism that were a hallmark of the agency following its creation after the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Indeed, the threats from overseas rate only passing mentions in this bulletin. It notes that al-Qaida supporters celebrated the January standoff at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. And it mentions that the Islamic State group called on supporters to carry out attacks in the United States to avenge the killings of the group’s leader and spokesman. DHS also warns that China, Russia, Iran and other nations seek to foment divisions within the U.S. to weaken the country and its standing in the world. In part, they do this by amplifying conspiracy theories and false reports that proliferate in American society. Domestic violent extremists, however, present the most pressing and potentially violent threat, the agency said, citing, for example, the racist attack in which a white gunman killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket in May. The bulletin, which is scheduled to expire Nov. 30, said calls for violence by domestic extremists directed at democratic institutions, candidates and election workers will likely increase through the fall. It said that people in online forums have praised the mass shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and encouraged copycat attacks. “The alert highlights the fact that society is becoming more violent every single day,” said Brian Harrell, a former assistant secretary at DHS. “Would-be criminals and domestic terrorists will always use the path of least resistance, and often times soft targets and crowded places are picked for this violence.” A senior DHS official, speaking to reporters ahead of the release of the bulletin, said it describes the situation as “dynamic” because authorities are seeing a wider variety of people motivated by a broader range of grievances and incidents than in the past. The upcoming decision from the Supreme Court, which could overturn Roe v. Wade, could lead to violence from either extremist supporters or opponents of abortion rights depending on the outcome, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss some factors that went into the preparation of the bulletin. Racial extremists may be motivated by immigration enforcement or whether the government continues to rely on Title 42, the public health order that has been used since the start of the coronavirus pandemic to prevent people from seeking asylum at the southwest border, DHS said. The agency and the FBI are working with state and local law enforcement to raise awareness of the threat, and DHS has increased grant funding to local governments and religious organizations to improve security, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in a statement released with the bulletin. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,U.S. Warns Of ‘Forceful’ Response If North Korea Restarts Nuclear Weapons Tests,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The United States warned North Korea Tuesday it would face a “swift and forceful” response if the country moved ahead with any test of its nuclear weapons. South Korea and the U.S. flew dozens of fighter jets near the Korean Peninsula the same day in a joint show of force, hoping to demonstrate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the countries’ militaries would quickly respond to any provocations. The demonstration comes amid increased tensions with Pyongyang and growing concern the Kim regime could be on the cusp of another nuclear demonstration, its first since 2017. North Korea launched a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday, just a day after the U.S. and South Korea held joint naval exercises near the Korean Peninsula. On Monday, the U.S. and South Korea fired their own barrage of ballistic missiles in a tit-for-tat, demonstrating the Biden administration’s harder line against the country’s antagonistic weapons program. North Korea has been extremely active with military tests after a relatively quiet period, launching 18 rounds of missiles in 2022 alone, more than both 2020 and 2021 combined. Defense analysts have said for months that North Korea appears to be working on its Punggye-ri test site, the country’s only known nuclear facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency also said Monday that North Korea may have opened an access way to the underground testing site, which could signal preparation for another nuclear test. “Any nuclear test would be in complete violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. There would be a swift and forceful response to such a test,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Tuesday after meeting with her counterparts in Seoul. “We continue to urge Pyongyang to cease its destabilizing and provocative activities and choose the path of diplomacy.” “The entire world will respond in a strong and clear manner,” Sherman continued, per Yonhap News. “We are prepared.” Sherman plans to meet with South Korea’s vice foreign minister and Japan’s vice foreign minister on Wednesday to discuss how to respond to any further provocation. If Kim does test another nuclear weapon, the act could pose a serious challenge to President Joe Biden after a period of relative calm with North Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nuclear negotiations have stalled since 2019, and any test could force the U.S. and its allies to reckon with Pyongyang as a nuclear armed power and give Kim more strength negotiating economic and security deals, the Associated Press notes. The Biden administration and South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, have vowed to punish North Korea for any further nuclear tests, including through increased sanctions that could further hamstring the already isolated nation. But it’s unclear how far any sanctions could go amid disagreement between the permanent members of the United Nations’ Security Council about how best to rein in North Korea. “Even at this moment, North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats are getting sophisticated,” South Korea’s newly-elected conservative president said Monday amid the latest round of missile launches. “North Korea’s nuclear and missile [programs] are reaching the level of threatening not only peace on the Korean Peninsula but also in Northeast Asia and the world.” North Korea’s weapons testing hasn’t slowed despite the country being in the grips of its first major outbreak of the coronavirus. Pyongyang reported nearly 74,000 new cases on Sunday, saying it had had more than four million since late April. Almost all North Koreans are thought to be unvaccinated, and the country has rejected any offers of medical assistance.

16,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Endorses Alessandra Biaggi Against Top House Democrat,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) endorsed state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi’s congressional bid on Tuesday, heightening the stakes of New York Democrats’ post-redistricting musical chairs game. Biaggi is competing with Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D), the influential chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for the Democratic nomination in New York’s redrawn 17th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement of Biaggi, an ally since 2018, is the rare case of a member of Congress supporting a primary candidate running against a fellow member of the same state congressional delegation. It highlights the degree to which court-ordered redistricting has upended internal Democratic Party dynamics ahead of what is expected to be a bruising midterm election cycle for the party. “We can count on her to stand with our movement on critical issues such as abortion rights, championing the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, and fighting to raise the minimum wage,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “We have an incredible opportunity to continue building progressive power by electing Alessandra.” Ocasio-Cortez and Biaggi have been kindred political spirits since Biaggi ousted rogue Democratic state Sen. Jeffrey Klein in the Bronx months after Ocasio-Cortez landed her upset against former Rep. Joe Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Biaggi’s run in that district, which overlapped with part of Ocasio-Cortez’s. “I am an underdog in this race, just like I was in 2018,” Biaggi told HuffPost. The endorsement will “signal to others, especially as we continue to coalition-build, that this is the campaign to join if you are an individual who wants to elect somebody who fights for the working people instead of somebody who puts his corporate donors first,” the state lawmaker added. Ocasio-Cortez’s blessing will come with a more immediate, tangible benefit as well. The progressive icon is using her massive campaign email list to fundraise for Biaggi on Tuesday. In the email appeal, Ocasio-Cortez asks supporters to take advantage of “an incredible opportunity to continue building progressive power by electing Alessandra.” Biaggi will need all the financial help she can get. As head of House Democrats’ campaign arm and a business-friendly lawmaker, Maloney is a top fundraiser. He had over $2 million in cash on hand as of the end of March. “Local voices are what matters in this race and they’re overwhelmingly supporting me,” Maloney told The New York Times, which first reported the endorsement. Maloney, who is white and openly gay, drew criticism in May when he announced that he would be running in New York’s 17th, a suburban seat currently held by Rep. Mondaire Jones, one of Congress’ first two openly gay Black men. Court-ordered redistricting had moved Maloney’s home into the district, but the majority of the seat was new terrain for him. Jones ultimately decided to run in an entirely new district in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. But progressives like Biaggi, who had been running in a different seat before new district lines were unveiled in May, were dissatisfied. She has argued that as the Democrat responsible for helping the party hold the House, Maloney’s decision to abandon New York’s 18th Congressional District — the more centrist seat he currently represents — “hurt the party.” Biaggi now faces an awkward district hop of her own. She currently lives a 15-minute drive south of New York’s 17th, but she and her husband are planning a move into the district in the coming weeks. She is betting that the prevailing dissatisfaction with elected Democrats on issues like rising gas prices could benefit a progressive gatecrasher. “This race is not just about standing against him, but really, also about the direction of the Democratic Party,” Biaggi said. Biaggi faults Maloney, a centrist who ran an unsuccessful campaign for New York attorney general in 2018, for voting to roll back part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, for bills that would have repealed components of the Affordable Care Act, and for a bill restricting the admission of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to the U.S. (He expressed regret for the latter vote.) In a district that now includes liberal suburban communities in Westchester and Rockland counties, as well as more rural towns in Putnam and Dutchess Counties, Biaggi is likely to face skepticism from some Democrats anxious about holding the seat in November. President Joe Biden carried the district by about 10 percentage points in 2020, which could put it within reach for a strong Republican contender in an especially bad cycle for Democrats. Assemblyman Mike Lawler (R), who represents suburban Rockland County, is expected to clinch the GOP nomination. Asked about her electability, Biaggi cited her record of fighting to codify abortion rights and close background check loopholes ― stances she said are popular with independents and some Republicans ― as well as her willingness to criticize former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) while he was in office. “I am not a political insider or party hack,” she told HuffPost. Although there are moderate candidates challenging some progressive incumbents, at least one Democratic insider used the occasion of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement to cast blame on progressives for fueling intra-party dissension at a time of mounting challenges for Democrats. Responding to the news of Ocasio-Cortez backing Biaggi, Jim Messina, who advised former President Barack Obama, blasted Biaggi for running against Maloney. “If we lose [the] [H]ouse it’s because of dumb shit like this,” he tweeted. National Republicans are understandably pleased to see Democrats fighting one another. “Sean Patrick Maloney’s cowardly decision to run in NY-17 is backfiring stupendously,” Sandra Bullock, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement responding to news of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement.

1,Son Of Buffalo Victim Implores Congress To Act Against 'Cancer Of White Supremacy',politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — The son of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year old woman killed when a gunman opened fire in a racist attack on Black shoppers in Buffalo, New York, challenged Congress Tuesday to act against the “cancer of white supremacy” and the nation’s epidemic of gun violence. Garnell Whitfield Jr’s emotional testimony comes as lawmakers are working furiously to strike a bipartisan agreement on gun safety measures in the aftermath of back-to-back mass shootings. Ten days after the death of his mother and 9 others in New York, another 18-year-old gunman with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 school children and two teachers. “What are you doing? You were elected to protect us,” Whitfield Jr. told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Is there nothing that you personally are willing to do to stop the cancer of white supremacy and the domestic terrorism it inspires?” he asked. “If there is nothing then, respectfully, senators … you should yield your positions of authority and influence to others that are willing to lead on this issue.” The hearing is the first of two this week as families of the victims and survivors of the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde appear at public hearings and events on Capitol Hill to show the human toll of America’s gun violence and urge Congress to act. Pressing for a deal, President Joe Biden was meeting Tuesday with Sen. Chris Murphy, a key Democratic negotiator, who has worked most of his career trying to curb the nation’s mass shooting scourge after the heartbreaking slaughter of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary in his home state of Connecticut a decade ago. “Enough,” Biden said last week in a televised address calling on Congress to act. On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee is expected to hear from more victims’ families and from fourth-grader Miah Cerrillo who captured Americans’ attention after she described covering herself in her dead classmate’s blood and playing dead to survive the shooting rampage in Uvalde. The Senate hearing Tuesday focused directly on the white supremacist ideology that authorities say led an 18-year-old gunman dressed in military gear to drive hours to a predominately Black neighborhood in Buffalo and live stream his violent rampage. The shooting left 10 people dead and several others wounded. “My mother’s life mattered,” Whitfield said. “Your actions here will tell us if and how much it mattered to you.” Senators have been meeting privately in a small bipartisan group headed by Murphy and Republican Sen. John Cornyn, trying to hash out a compromise that could actually become law. But lawmakers have been here before — unable to pass any substantial gun safety laws in decades in the face of steep objections from Republicans in Congress, some conservative Democrats, and the fierce lobby of gun owners and the National Rifle Association. No major legislation has made it into law since the 1994 assault weapons ban, which has since expired. The package under discussion is far short of the sweeping measures for an assault weapons ban or universal background checks that are popular with Americans and advocated by gun safety groups, but rejected by Republicans. Instead, the senators are focusing on incremental policy changes through a system that would send funds and other incentives to the states to bolster security at school campuses, provide more mental health services to young people and possibly encourage states to pursue red-flag laws to keep firearms out of the hands of people who would do harm. “I’m optimistic we can get 60-plus votes — but the question is what that package looks like,” Cornyn told reporters as lawmakers arrived back in town Monday from a week-long recess. Cornyn was referring to the 60-vote threshold needed in the 50-50 Senate to advance legislation past a filibuster that can block most any bill. The Texas senator said he was preparing to brief his colleagues Tuesday, at their weekly Senate lunch, on the status of negotiations. But he warned Democrats off rushing the process, saying “arbitrary deadlines” are no help in the talks. While senators are reluctant to raise the age requirement for gun purchases from 18 to 21, as has been done in some states, an alternative idea surfacing is to open the records of juvenile offenders to look for problem spots before allowing adults to purchase weapons. Murphy said that Cornyn has articulated a legitimate concern that many times law enforcement doesn’t have access to juvenile records when making a decision on a background check. “That clearly seems like something we should fix and address,” Murphy said. “That’s certainly a part of our talks. It’s complicated because different states have different rules when it comes to juvenile records.” The proposals are gaining traction, but also raising concerns from Democrats and some advocacy groups who are pushing senators to do more, faster, to stem the tide of mass shootings across the nation. ___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.

2,North Carolina's Lieutenant Governor Takes Sexism To Biblical New Low,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost If North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson wants women’s votes, he sure has a funny way of showing it. Robinson, a Republican positioning himself to run for governor in 2024, interpreted biblical scripture to suggest that women should not be in charge. (Watch the video below.) “We are called to be led by men,” he said last month in a Charlotte-area church speech reported by WRAL on Monday. He acknowledged at the same time that such remarks would get him “in trouble.” On Tuesday, he accused the media of reporting misleadingly on the matter. “God sent women out … when they had to do their thing, but when it was time to face down Goliath, [he] sent David. Not Davida — David,” he said at the time. By the same token, God picked Moses to lead the Israelites, he said. “Not Momma Moses,” he preached. “Daddy Moses.” Well more than half of North Carolina’s registered voters are female, according to state records. “My God tells me that when I face adversity that, number one, I am to stand up like a man! M-A-N!” he added during a rant in which he chided churchgoers who “listen to the doctrine of social justice instead of listening to the doctrine of Jesus Christ.” Robinson on Tuesday posted a video to Facebook, saying his words about leadership were misinterpreted. He said he was encouraging men to step up in leadership roles. He praised the leadership his mother showed in raising him and said he believed women can succeed as leaders in their own homes and in the community and nation. But the far-right lieutenant governor has a history of making incendiary comments. Robinson, a Donald Trump supporter who spoke at the former president’s North Carolina rally in April, has previously suggested on social media that Michelle Obama was a man. He denies the existence of systemic racism and climate change, proudly owns AR-15 assault rifles and has called the LGBTQ community “filth.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Extremist Gun Group Says To Prepare For ‘Battle’ At U.S. Capitol Amid Gun Control Talks,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The far-right American Firearms Association is telling its supporters to prepare for “battle” at the U.S. Capitol this week amid Senate talks on potential legislation for relatively small gun safety reforms. “They’re coming after us right now,” warns the subject line of a Monday fundraising email, signed by AFA president Christopher Dorr. “Our federal legislative team believes that because of the enormity of the battle this week in DC, there will be thousands or even tens of thousands of Bloomberg-funded, red shirt radical, commie mommies all over the Capitol complex,” reads the email, apparently referring to the gun safety group, Moms Demand Action. “This is their Super Bowl,” it continues. “You and I should be looking at this battle in exactly the same way.” Here’s a screenshot from the email: The AFA’s warnings echo the nightmarish statements made by former President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, when he whipped up his supporters at a rally to storm the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as president. That led to a violent insurrection. “We fight like hell,” Trump told his supporters before they marched to the Capitol that day. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” AFA’s wildly overheated rhetoric doesn’t match what senators are considering doing, which is very little in response to the ongoing epidemic of gun violence. The bipartisan package currently being negotiated by senators, which could still fall apart, would include provisions to narrowly expand gun background checks, enhance school safety, incentivize states to implement so-called red flag laws, and provide resources for new mental health programs. Separate from the Senate, the House is considering its own mix of gun safety bills, including measures to raise the age for buying AR-15s from 18 to 21, and to require gun owners to register homemade firearms through the federal background checks system. But none of the House proposals are expected to move in the Senate, so all eyes are on what meager legislation can possibly move in the upper chamber. You wouldn’t know any of this by the language in AFA’s email. “With the gun-grabbers in Congress launching their full-frontal assault on our Second Amendment rights RIGHT NOW, our entire AFA staff is on red alert,” the email says, before floating the idea that progressives are ready to somehow cut off the group’s ability to use social media. “We fully expect our systems to be attacked by nefarious, left-wing actors who want to shut our systems down and stop your voice from reaching into Congressional offices on Capitol Hill.” Here’s another email screenshot: Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, noted the veiled threat by AFA on Twitter on Monday. “I love that we scare men who can’t go on a toilet paper run without guns,” she tweeted. The American Firearms Association is telling its supporters to prepare for ""battle"" with ""thousands or even tens of thousands of … red shirt radical, commie mommies all over the Capitol complex.""I love that we scare men who can’t go on a toilet paper run without guns. https://t.co/CcP0cJCqVx The AFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what it meant by its calls for “battle,” and whether it is concerned that its overheated rhetoric could drive some people to head to the Capitol to cause violence.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks.

8,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

9,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer.

10,EMILY's List Backs Erin Maye Quade In Minnesota,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost In April, it looked like Erin Maye Quade’s bid for Minnesota state Senate was done. On the day of the convention to get her party’s nomination, Maye Quade was in labor. She nevertheless attended the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (the state equivalent of the Democratic Party) event and even delivered a speech while experiencing contractions. But after pushing through for a few hours, Maye Quade eventually had to go to the hospital. And because no one stopped the convention for her medical emergency, she withdrew from the nomination process. Yet since then, Maye Quade has received national attention and strong support. A couple weeks later, she jumped back into the race. And now, she’s going to have a powerful national organization helping her out. EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic pro-choice women running for office, is throwing its support behind Maye Quade. “As the nation’s largest resource for women in politics, EMILY’s List is committed to breaking down obstacles that prevent mothers from running for office,” Laphonza Butler, the group’s president, said in a statement first shared with HuffPost. “We commend Maye Quade’s resilience and determination while attending the Democratic-Farmer-Labor endorsing convention and delivering a speech while in active labor, and we know that she will bring this tenacity to the state Senate to fight for Minnesotans.” Most of the time, EMILY’s List announces a group of state and local endorsements together in a single release. But in an indication of the importance of this race, the group announced Maye Quade’s alone. “From addressing racial disparities to fully funding public schools, Maye Quade has a proven record of taking on tough fights, even when others have told her to back down,” Butler added. With Maye Quade absent, the DFL party threw its support behind Justin Emmerich for the state Senate race in the 56th District. It would have taken two-thirds of the delegates present to suspend the convention for Maye Quade’s emergency. Organizers, as well as Emmerich, have said they would have proceeded with a request from Maye Quade to halt the event, but Maye Quade’s supporters say that she ― the woman in labor ― should not have borne the burden of this responsibility. “I think that they would’ve stopped this convention for any other medical emergency, but instead they put a Black woman through immense pain and put her in front of the room during one of her most vulnerable moments in life ― in front of a room of 200 people,” Emma McBride, political director of Women Winning, who works with Maye Quade’s wife and was a campaign surrogate, told HuffPost at the time. On May 16, Maye Quade announced she would continue her campaign and challenge Emmerich in the August primary. “Birth is unpredictable, but my experience wasn’t unique. It was emblematic of the larger battle we are fighting to build a world where reproductive health is prioritized and Black women’s health is taken seriously,” she wrote in a social media post. Maye Quade served in the state House from 2017 to 2019, just the third Black woman to serve in the chamber. In 2018, she ran as the DFL-endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor, becoming the first LGBTQ person endorsed on the ticket of a major political party in Minnesota. (She lost in the primary.) Minnesota has never had a Black woman in the state Senate. In 2017, Maye Quade became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota, when she and other women accused a state senator of sexual harassment. In her current bid for state Senate, Maye Quade has also picked up the endorsement of Planned Parenthood, among other groups. She has said she has received an outpouring of support since her convention address. Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Biden Under Pressure From Green Groups To Designate His First National Monument,politics," Environment Reporter, HuffPost When the Antiquities Act turned 111 in June 2017, the landmark conservation law was under attack. Then-President Donald Trump had launched a review of more than two dozen national monuments designated or expanded under the act, arguing that recent administrations had abused it to “lock up millions of acres of land and water.” That review ended with Trump dismantling protections for three national monuments — two in Utah and a third off the East Coast. Five years later, dozens of national and local organizations are calling on President Joe Biden to mark the 116th anniversary of the Antiquities Act by establishing a new monument at Castner Range, a former military weapon testing facility in West Texas. The 7,000-acre landscape is home to archaeological sites and a diversity of rare and at-risk wildlife but is off-limits to the public due to unexploded ordnance from years of military testing. In a letter to Biden on Tuesday — a day ahead of the Antiquities Act’s anniversary — a coalition of 92 organizations wrote that doing so would “affirm your commitment to protecting our national treasures as well as help counteract a history of inequitable access to the outdoors.” The coalition includes national environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters and The Wilderness Society, as well as Texas-based organizations like Environment Texas and Frontera Land Alliance. Biden campaigned on a pledge to not only reverse Trump’s unpopular monument rollbacks but establish new protected sites to combat global climate change and safeguard ecologically important landscapes. He’s also set a goal of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, an initiative known informally as “30x30.” In October, Biden followed through on restoring Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, as well as Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the East Coast. But nearly a year and a half into his presidency, to the frustration of some conservation groups, Biden has yet to use his executive power to create a monument of his own. While many sweeping monument designations have proved controversial, particularly in states where the federal government controls large amounts of land, Castner Range has garnered widespread and growing support. In April, for example, the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an organization that represents current and former National Park Service employees, issued a report that identified six “national treasures in need of protection” and lobbied Biden to use his powers under the Antiquities Act. Castner Range was at the top of the group’s list. During a March visit to Castner Range, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland hiked lands adjacent to those being eyed for a future monument and met with local officials “to learn about their vision for increasing access to, and conservation of, outdoor spaces,” the Interior Department said in a press release at the time. Unlike in neighboring New Mexico, there are few open spaces for outdoor enthusiasts to hike and recreate in West Texas, said Janaé Field, executive director of El Paso-based conservation nonprofit Frontera Land Alliance. “There’s just so many people trying to access public spaces, and there’s just not enough room to accommodate all the footprints,” she told HuffPost. Field noted that the effort to protect Castner Range has been ongoing for more than five decades and said the landscape “checks all the boxes” for a national monument. In its letter, the coalition writes that a monument designation would help the Biden administration advance several priorities at once, from combating climate change and safeguarding biodiversity to correcting environmental injustices. Most state and local parks in and around El Paso charge admission fees that “create a significant additional barrier in equitable access” to the outdoors, the coalition writes. Signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act authorizes presidents to “declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.” Sixteen presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used it to create more than 150 monuments since 1906, including many sites that later became national parks. Field is hopeful that Castner Range will be the first of several national monuments Biden establishes during his presidency. “Hopefully, he ends a 51-year effort,” she said. “But if not, I don’t see the community stopping.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Inside New York’s Wildest Democratic Congressional Primary,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost In late April, a panel of state judges struck down New York Democrats’ partisan congressional district maps, which the Empire State’s dominant party had drawn to offset Republican gerrymandering in red states. The new, court-ordered maps ― finalized in late May ― set off a scramble as rival incumbents prepared to face off against one another and primary challengers cast about to optimize their odds. A new congressional district, New York’s 10th, emerged as something else entirely: a solidly Democratic seat in which an array of different contenders could compete in an open field. Voting is scheduled to conclude on Aug. 23. The district, comprising lower Manhattan and a cluster of contiguous neighborhoods in central and South Brooklyn, is a racially and economically diverse subset of the Big Apple. It has some of New York City’s largest Chinese and Latino populations, a vibrant LGBTQ community, a high concentration of affluent liberal voters, and a chunk of Borough Park, an Orthodox Jewish enclave. The district has attracted a broad range of Democratic candidates befitting the diversity and liberal leanings of its residents. Below is a rundown of the top 8 contenders, in no particular order. (Head over to the Gotham Gazette for a comprehensive list of announced candidates.) Rep. Mondaire Jones, one of the first two openly gay, Black members of Congress, handily won a crowded Democratic primary in New York City’s northern suburbs in 2020. One of his opponents, an heir to a biotechnology fortune, heavily outspent Jones — and still lost by a wide margin. But faced with a more conservative electorate and a bruising primary against the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jones, a staunch progressive, decided to try his luck in an entirely new district rather than stick it out in the suburbs. Jones is likely to face some skepticism from voters — and rivals — for moving to the district for the primary. But he enjoys advantages that could blunt some of that challenge. A fundraising powerhouse, he starts the race with nearly $3 million in cash, the support of influential Democrats and exposure on cable television that he is already using to tout his commitment to tougher gun regulation. New York State Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou is one of the highest-profile members of a young crop of progressives who represent New York City in the state capital of Albany. Elected as a state lawmaker in 2016, she defeated a candidate backed by the disgraced former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who had previously held the seat. Her victory doubled Albany’s contingent of Asian American lawmakers to two. Niou, a Taiwanese immigrant who already represents Manhattan’s Chinatown, would be New York City’s second Asian American member of Congress. At a time when Asian New Yorkers are experiencing rising incidents of violence, Niou has said that ethnic representation is more important than ever. (New York’s 10th includes the Chinese community in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, as well.) Niou has also carved out a niche as an outspoken progressive willing to buck the state’s Democratic establishment. She was an early endorser of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential bid and a consistent critic of then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The most hardcore elements of the activist left are already gravitating toward her campaign; the New York City chapter of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate action group, endorsed her on Monday. New York City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera currently represents several of the lower Manhattan neighborhoods in New York’s 10th, including the Lower East Side, where she grew up in Section 8 housing. The daughter of a unionized city employee who moved to New York City from Puerto Rico, Rivera got her start in city politics fighting to ensure affordable housing and community input in a major Lower East Side construction project. While other candidates have clearer ideological lanes, Rivera is a mainstream progressive running as a pragmatic and dogged advocate for her constituents. She touts her work sponsoring athletic programs for youth in her district and the establishment of one of the country’s first municipally backed funds to help women from other states seeking abortions in New York. Rivera, who ran unsuccessfully for city council speaker last year, sees the chance to land similar benefits for her community if sent to Washington. She would also provide Hispanic representation to a district with large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican and Central American populations. A possible endorsement from her mentor, Rep. Nydia Velázquez, is something to watch for. Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a resident of Park Slope, where progressive politics are as foundational as the multimillion-dollar brownstones, starts with sky-high name recognition and the rare distinction of earning disdain from both the city’s most conservative voters and its most left-leaning ones. But if de Blasio is the former mayor everyone loves to hate — even a former spokesperson is now advising Jones — he is also routinely underestimated by his opponents. He boasts strong ties to the city’s most powerful labor unions, whose support for current Mayor Eric Adams he helped organize. He retains a base of support with working-class Black New Yorkers. And he has experience courting ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters in Borough Park, part of which he represented on the city council years ago. Maud Maron is a criminal defense attorney angling for the centrist lane in New York’s 10th. She has been an outspoken critic of the left-wing movement to reduce law enforcement funding, the closure of New York City’s public schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consensus among liberals that gender is separate from biological sex. Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor and House Democrats’ lead attorney during the 2019 impeachment of then-President Donald Trump, is making his debut as a candidate for public office. A resident of lower Manhattan, he is campaigning as a champion of voting rights and a fierce opponent of right-wing authoritarianism. Goldman’s run will test the staying power of the stardom his impeachment work earned him with the viewership of MSNBC and other liberal outlets. Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon has represented downtown Brooklyn and several brownstone-Brooklyn neighborhoods in New York’s 10th since 2015.

While she ran unsuccessfully for Brooklyn borough president in 2021, she has a base of support in Brooklyn from which to build. When Elizabeth Holtzman unseated 50-year incumbent Rep.

13,Jill Biden Kicks Off Pride Month By Hailing Nancy Reagan,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost First lady Jill Biden on Monday celebrated former first lady Nancy Reagan getting her face on a postage stamp. That might seem like a nice thing to do, except that she did this as LGBTQ Pride Month kicks off ― and Reagan’s husband’s administration spent years ignoring that gay men were dying by the thousands from AIDS complications. Nancy Reagan “made such a difference,” Biden raved during a White House ceremony as she stood next to a massive image of the former first lady’s face on a stamp. “First lady Nancy Reagan served the American people with grace,” she continued. “She understood that the role of first lady came with inherent pitfalls and scrutiny, yet she found the humanity in it all.” Both Jill Biden and President Joe Biden are strong supporters of LGBTQ rights, which makes the decision to honor Reagan at the start of Pride Month ill-timed, at best. Just last week, the president issued a proclamation declaring June 2022 “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) Pride Month.” “This month, we remind the LGBTQI+ community that they are loved and cherished,” President Biden said in his proclamation. “My Administration sees you for who you are — deserving of dignity, respect, and support.” Former President Ronald Reagan was very different. Before becoming president, he referred to gay people as “sick unfortunates,” and as governor of California he stalled the repeal of the state’s anti-sodomy laws. After coming to the White House in 1980, Reagan stayed silent for years as the AIDS epidemic ravaged the LGBTQ community. He didn’t give his first major public address on the AIDS crisis until May 1987, after thousands of people, mostly gay and bisexual men, had died. This was after he recommended cutting federal AIDS spending in 1986. Nancy Reagan herself turned down a plea for help from her friend, actor Rock Hudson, who in 1985 was desperately trying to get treatment for AIDS in France. Nine weeks before he died, he asked the White House for help getting transferred to another hospital for an experimental treatment in a last-ditch effort to save his life. Nancy Reagan said no. Monday’s event honoring Reagan also featured U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was recently sued by a former postal worker who claimed he was discriminated against and fired for being gay and HIV-positive. DeJoy got the case dismissed entirely on a technicality. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the first openly LGBTQ person to hold this post, pointed HuffPost to the first lady’s office for comment. Michael LaRosa, the press secretary for the first lady, said the timing of the event honoring Nancy Reagan was pegged to the opening of a building in D.C. “This ceremonial postage stamp unveiling was timed to commemorate Mrs. Reagan’s centennial and was scheduled the day before the opening of the Ronald Reagan Institute building in D.C.,” LaRosa told HuffPost in a Tuesday statement. “President Biden and the First Lady have a long and proud record of supporting, fighting for, and leading on, LGBTQ+ rights, and those living with HIV/AIDs,” he said. “Just last month, Dr. Biden visited a shelter in Panama for those living with HIV/AIDS and announced an additional $80 million in PEPFAR funds for the region. The White House and the First Family are planning several ways to honor and celebrate PRIDE month.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,"Once Dumped By Trump, Mo Brooks Seeks His Endorsement Again",politics," MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks is asking former President Donald Trump to back him once again in Alabama’s Senate race, a request that comes two months after a feud caused Trump to revoke his endorsement of the congressman. Brooks on Sunday released a statement on Twitter asking “MAGA Nation” to help plead his case for Trump’s endorsement, calling himself the “Trump candidate” in the race. Brooks faces Katie Britt in the June 21 runoff that will decide the GOP nomination for the seat being vacating by retiring Sen. Richard Shelby. “Join me in asking President Trump to #ReEndorseMo so that we can send a message to Mitch McConnell by sending a real America First conservative to the Senate on June 21,” the tweet read. MAGA Nation, here is my story. Join me in asking President Trump to #ReEndorseMo so that we can send a message to Mitch McConnell by sending a real America First conservative to the Senate on June 21. pic.twitter.com/ceVHruhHYA Trump had initially endorsed Brooks last year, rewarding the conservative firebrand who whipped up a crowd of Trump supporters at the Jan. 6, 2021, rally that preceded the U.S. Capitol insurrection. But Trump in March rescinded his endorsement of Brooks, citing his lagging performance and accusing him of going “woke” for suggesting it was time to move on from Trump’s false 2020 election fraud claims. “Very sad but, since he decided to go in another direction, so have I, and I am hereby withdrawing my Endorsement of Mo Brooks for the Senate,” Trump said in March. Brooks, at the time stinging from Trump’s rebuke, laughed at Trump’s characterization that he was “woke” and said he and Trump fell out because he rebuffed the former president’s entreaties to help overturn the 2020 election. “He wanted the election rescinded and a do-over,” Brooks told reporters in March. “But there’s no legal way to do it.” Making a case that he should return to Trump’s favor, Brooks wrote on Sunday that Trump “gave our campaign the kick in the pants we needed.” Despite losing Trump’s backing, Brooks made his way to a second place finish in the May primary, edging out “Black Hawk Down” pilot Mike Durant. Brooks had continued to campaign as “MAGA Mo” after losing Trump’s endorsement. Brooks’ plea to Trump comes after he trailed the deep-pocketed Britt in the initial round of voting. Trump so far has not made another endorsement in the race. Sean Ross, a spokesman for Britt, said it “appears that Congressman Brooks’ poor performance in the polls has led him to this new level of desperation, but it’s especially interesting given his frequent flip-flopping.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,CNN's Midterm Election Forecast Is Unbelievably Grim For Democrats,politics," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Monday predicted a 2022 midterm election landslide for Republicans in the House of Representatives. (Watch the video below.) The November elections are months away, but Enten’s findings are pointing in the wrong direction for Democrats, who hold a 12-seat House majority. Enten said Republicans are in their best position in more than 80 years. “My estimate for the 2023 House makeup, if the election were held today, which again, it isn’t ... would be Republicans, 236 seats to 241 seats. Democrats, 194 to 199,” he said. Host Jake Tapper noted that the turnover would amount to a “stomping” for Democrats. “Yes it would,” Enten replied. Enten based part of his forecast on generic voting preferences (simply Democrat or Republican) in competitive congressional districts and compared them to historical models. The trend heavily favors the GOP, which is also being boosted by President Joe Biden’s lower approval ratings amid inflation, Tapper noted. Data points to a November blowout, CNN's Harry Enten say, telling Jake Tapper that the GOP is currently in ""the best position for Republicans at this point in any midterm cycle in over 80 years."" pic.twitter.com/V3vevMlIXJ Democrats are hoping the Supreme Court threat to abortion rights, the failure of GOP lawmakers to budge on gun control after repeated mass shootings, and continued fallout from the Capitol riot will help the party rally.

16,Republican Who Represented Uvalde Demands 'More Than Thoughts And Prayers',politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Will Hurd, a former U.S. House member who represented Uvalde, Texas, wants “more than thoughts and prayers” in addressing the nation’s gun violence issue. “Last month, a fourth-grade classroom in Uvalde, Texas, a small, quiet community that I represented in Congress, became a war zone. Nineteen beautiful, innocent children and two dedicated, brave teachers are gone forever because of a vicious massacre,” Hurd wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times published Monday. “It’s infuriating. It’s heartbreaking. It was preventable.” In the wake of the massacre at Robb Elementary School, and another mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, that left 10 dead last month, a bipartisan group of senators are working on a gun control bill. But GOP lawmakers have argued that no new laws would prevent people from committing gun violence and blamed the shootings on an array of other factors. Many were criticized for offering “thoughts and prayers” instead of meaningful solutions. “I believe in the plain language of the Second Amendment. In Congress I had an A rating with the National Rifle Association, and they supported my re-election campaigns,” Hurd noted. “I also believe it’s ridiculous that any attempt to reform laws to keep lethal firearms out of irresponsible hands is met with outrage and stonewalling.” Hurd called for a multifaceted approach to America’s gun violence issue, including stronger social safety nets in communities and accessible, quality mental health care facilities. “But we also must be prepared if our attempts are unsuccessful — and that means preventing potential mass shooters from getting access to weapons and victims,” he wrote. Hurd was one of eight Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of a bill passed by the House last year that would’ve required universal background checks for gun purchases. Bills like that should become law, Hurd said, and the age to purchase a high-caliber semiautomatic weapon should be raised. Red flag laws that allow law enforcement to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals who may pose a danger to themselves or others should also be built at a federal level, he said. “Mass shootings don’t have to be a fact of life. They are preventable. However, we can’t retreat to our political corners and repeat the same tired talking points,” Hurd stated. Read Hurd’s full column in The New York Times.

Patricia and Mark McCloskey sparked national outrage in 2020 — and praise from former President Donald Trump — after pointing a handgun and an AR-15 assault-style rifle at racial justice demonstrators who were heading to the home of the St. Louis mayor to protest the police killing of George Floyd. Missouri Gov. Michael Parson (R) pardoned the couple last year after they pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and harassment charges and were fined. But the state body that polices attorney misconduct sought to rescind their law licenses. The Supreme Court of Missouri initially agreed to suspend the couple’s law licenses indefinitely, but then stayed the suspensions and placed the two lawyers on probation for a year during which time their behavior would be monitored. The McCloskeys argued that the court ruling violated their Second Amendment rights and that they were “exercising lawful rights to bear arms in defense of their person, family and home.” They referred to the staunch support from Trump.

2,Voters Head To The Polls In 7 States Today,politics," LOS ANGELES (AP) — Primary elections in seven states Tuesday will set the stage for U.S. House and Senate races this fall, with many contests shaped by political fissures in both major parties and the lingering shadow of former President Donald Trump. With control of Congress in play, a string of Republican House incumbents are contending with challenges from the political right, and some rivals are embracing Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud in his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. No incumbent governors or senators appear to be in imminent danger. In Iowa, several Democrats are jockeying for the chance to take on seven-term Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, with the campaign showcasing the breach between the Democratic Party’s progressive and establishment wings. Former Trump Cabinet member Ryan Zinke is seeking the GOP nomination in a newly created House district in Montana. What to watch in Tuesday’s primaries in California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota: California is a Democratic fortress where the party holds every statewide office and its voters outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Gov. Gavin Newsom and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla face little-known competitors. But Republicans retain pockets of strength in some U.S. House districts that are expected to be among the most competitive races in the country. In a heavily Democratic district in the state’s Central Valley farm belt, Republican U.S. Rep. David Valadao is seeing blowback for his vote to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection. Republican Chris Mathys has made Valadao’s vote a centerpiece in his campaign to oust him. In a Democratic-leaning district north of Los Angeles, several Democrats are hoping to take on Republican Rep. Mike Garcia, who is expected to advance to November with one of the Democrats as the top two finishers in the race. Garcia rejected electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania being cast for Biden and opposed Trump’s impeachment after the Capitol insurrection. The crowded Los Angeles mayor’s race is shaping up to be a fight between Rick Caruso, a pro-business billionaire Republican-turned-Democrat who sits on the board of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, who was on Biden’s shortlist for vice president. If no candidate clears 50%, the top two finishers advance to a November runoff. In another closely watched election, San Francisco voters are considering whether to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, a progressive Democrat who critics say has failed to prosecute repeat offenders, amid widespread frustration with crime and homelessness. Republicans have gained an advantage in the state over the past decade, and the Democratic Senate primary provides a snapshot of the minority party’s battle for relevance. Retired Navy Vice Adm. Michael Franken is waging a competitive contest with former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer in a bid to take on the 88-year-old Grassley, who has been endorsed by Trump. Finkenauer is a 33-year-old, former two-term state representative who argues her youth and more recent experience in Iowa make her a better fit to challenge a Republican first elected to the Senate in 1980. She has made term limits a centerpiece of her campaign. Franken, 64, is promoting a progressive agenda, including adding a public insurance option to the Affordable Care Act. He is from conservative western Iowa and argues he could be more competitive against Grassley by whittling into the senator’s margins in heavily Republican areas. Physician Glenn Hurst, a councilman for a small western Iowa city and the Iowa Democratic Party’s chair for its rural caucus, is running to the left of both Finkenauer and Franken. Meanwhile, three Republicans are competing for a chance to run against Iowa’s lone Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Cindy Axne. Republican U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo is facing his largest-ever field of challengers after a congressional ethics watchdog raised questions about his campaign spending. A 2021 report by the Office of Congressional Ethics found “substantial reason to believe” Palazzo, a military veteran who serves on the Appropriations and Homeland Security committees, abused his office by misspending campaign funds, doing favors for his brother and enlisting staff for political and personal errands. His then-spokesperson, Colleen Kennedy, said the probe was based on politically motivated “false allegations.” His six opponents include a sheriff, Mike Ezell, and a state senator, Brice Wiggins. If no candidate wins a majority of votes, a runoff will be June 28. Mississippi’s two other Republican congressmen, Trent Kelly and Michael Guest, face primary challengers who support Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. It’s the first time since 1993 that the state will have two House seats, after one was added to account for Montana’s growing population. Zinke, Trump’s former Interior Department secretary, technically is in an open race for the new seat. But the former Navy SEAL is widely considered the de facto incumbent, since he twice won elections for the state’s other House seat before stepping down in 2017 to join the Trump administration. His opponents are drawing attention to Zinke’s troubled tenure at the agency, which was marked by multiple ethics investigations. One investigation determined Zinke lied to an agency ethics official about his continued involvement in a commercial real estate deal in his hometown. He’s faced a smear campaign over his military service from the extreme right wing of his party and questions about his residency following revelations that his wife declared a house in California as her primary residence. His opponents in the GOP primary include former state Sen. Al “Doc” Olszewski, an orthopedic surgeon and hard-line conservative who has tried to paint Zinke as a “liberal insider.” Three Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination: public health advocate Cora Neumann, Olympic rower and attorney Monica Tranel and former state Rep. Tom Winter. In the state’s other district, first-term Rep. Matt Rosendale, who has Trump’s endorsement, will look to fend off three Republican primary challengers. A dozen House districts are on the ballot. Trump said in 2021 he would back a challenger to long-serving Republican Rep. Chris Smith, but that never happened. The absence of an endorsement hasn’t stopped conservative talk show host Mike Crispi, one of Smith’s Republican challengers, from claiming Trump’s mantle. In northern New Jersey, former state Senate minority leader Tom Kean Jr. has a fundraising edge and establishment support over five rivals. Kean, the son of former Republican Gov. Tom Kean Sr., is hoping for a rematch with Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, who won a close contest two years ago. On the Democratic side, U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez’s son, Rob, is running for a seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Rep. Albio Sires. Menendez, a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey commissioner, locked up party support upon entering the race. Five Republican candidates are competing to take on Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. The incumbent is favored to keep her job in a state where Democrats control every statewide office and dominate the Legislature. Former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti and state Rep. Rebecca Dow are prominent GOP contenders in a contest touching on concerns about U.S. border security, urban crime, inflation and the teaching of race and ethnicity in a heavily Latino and Native American state. Democratic voters are deciding on a nominee for the state’s top law enforcement post to succeed Attorney General Hector Balderas. Albuquerque-based District Attorney Raúl Torrez is competing against state Auditor Brian Colón in a hard-fought campaign with few ideological divisions. A trio of Republican incumbents face primary challengers running on their political right. Gov. Kristi Noem, who is considered a potential White House prospect, is favored to win the GOP nomination. One rival, state legislator Steve Haugaard, has argued that Noem spent more time trying to build a national political profile than focusing on her job at home. She’s mostly ignored him. U.S. Sen. John Thune faced Trump’s ire after dismissing the former president’s election fraud claims. However, no well-known challenger has emerged in Thune’s reelection bid. One of his opponents, Mark Mowry, was among the crowd that demonstrated near the Capitol on Jan. 6. In the House, Republican state lawmaker Taffy Howard is trying to unseat GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson in the state’s lone district. Johnson touts his conservative voting record while keeping an ability to work across party lines, but Howard has tried to paint him as a foot soldier for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ___ Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa; Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Miss.; Matthew Brown in Billings, Mont.; Michael Catalini in Trenton, N.J.; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, N.M.; and Stephen Groves in Sioux Falls, S.D., contributed to this report.

3,PAC Sparks Complaints For Handing Out $25 Gas Vouchers While Campaigning For Herschel Walker,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A right-wing political action committee gave away $25 fuel vouchers at an Atlanta gas station over the weekend as it sought to drum up support for GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker. The effort triggered complaints from Democrats and voting rights activists. A volunteer said on video that the giveaway was the candidate’s idea. “Herschel Walker decided, ’You know what? We’re gonna do this free gas giveaway for the community,’” Angela Stanton King said. King, a QAnon acolyte who unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year after she was pardoned by former President Donald Trump for a felony conviction linked to a car theft ring, called the vouchers a gift from Walker. Campaign flyers promoting the former NFL star, who has been endorsed by Trump, were also passed out to drivers waiting in line. It’s a felony in Georgia to pay for votes or bribe voters. Georgia election law states that “any person who gives or receives, offers to give or receive, or participates in the giving or receiving of money or gifts for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate in any primary or election shall be guilty of a felony.” The state’s voting law even bans volunteers from handing out water to voters while they’re waiting in line at the polls. Federal campaign laws also bars candidates from directly influencing or cooperating with PACs that support them. Angela Stanton King, who was pardoned by Trump after her conspiracy conviction: “Herschel Walker decided, ‘you know what, we’re gonna do this free gas giveaway for the community. I want them to know I care.

Bee Nguyen, who’s running for Georgia secretary of state, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Are they going to do something about it?” A spokesperson for Georgia’s Office of Secretary of State declined to comment on the gas vouchers, but told HuffPost that the office would “follow up on any complaints” received. Walker’s campaign denied it had anything to do with the giveaway. PAC 34N22, which is named for Walker’s old football jersey number and the current year, told the AJC that Walker did not arrange or direct the voucher handout. A statement from a PAC attorney said the voucher giveaway was legal because they were given “without condition,” and that no one was “required to vote, to register to vote, to support or oppose any particular candidate”: I asked the group whether handing out the $25 fuel vouchers was legal.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,politics," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
10,An Infamous Day. A Search For Answers. Will America Tune In?,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are processing the nightmare of the slaughter of children in Texas, the racist murders in Buffalo, New York, and the other numbingly repeated scenes of carnage in the United States. They’re contending with what feels like highway robbery at the gas pump, they’re nagged by a virus that the world can’t shake, and they’re split into two hostile camps over politics and culture — the twin pillars of the nation’s foundation. They’ve already been through two set-piece dramas of presidential impeachment — indeed, through the wringer on all things Donald Trump. Now, beginning in prime time on Thursday, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is setting out to establish the historical record of an event damaging not only to a community or individual families but to the collective idea of democracy itself. After more than 100 subpoenas, 1,000 interviews and 100,000 documents, the committee has a story to tell in hearings that open this week. A story for the ages, it’s been said. The open question: How much will the country care? The committee’s examination of the actions of Trump and all the president’s men and women, more aggressive than any inquiry before it, has produced a multitude of plot lines that together will tell the tale of a violent uprising fueled by the venom and lies of a defeated president. Many Republicans, even those who condemned Trump and the violence in the moment, have adopted a “nothing more to see here” posture since, even rejecting calls for an independent Sept. 11-style commission to investigate. An entire disinformation ecosystem sprung up with utterly false claims about the nature and character of the attack. Rather than condemn the attack, Trump continues to insist his defeat by 7 million votes should be overturned, in effect validating the rioters’ cause. Dozens of the insurrectionists have been brought to justice, many of them being convicted or pleading guilty to serious crimes. But the committee’s goal is larger: Who in a position of power should also be held to account? There are endless ribbons of inquiry. Did Vice President Mike Pence refuse to leave the besieged Capitol because he suspected the Secret Service, at the behest of Trump, was trying to take him away to stop him from certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory? Did Trump flush incriminating papers down the White House toilet? How to explain the gap of more than seven hours in White House telephone logs of Trump’s calls during the insurrection? Will it stand in history alongside the infamous 18 1/2-minute hole in President Richard Nixon’s secret White House recording system in 1972? The Watergate affair, which exposed Nixon’s cover-up of politically motivated criminal acts and destroyed his presidency, centered on a question posed by a Republican senator, Howard Baker, in a Tennessee drawl: “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” For the Jan. 6 committee, the key question about Trump’s involvement in the insurrection is: What did the president do, and when did he do it? One aim is to establish whether Trump’s acts are criminal, as one judge has mused they may be, and whether that would prompt a politically fraught Justice Department prosecution of an ex-president. More broadly, the effort addresses who might be punished in the large circle of Trump enablers. Some of them are members of Congress who helped him plot how to try to overturn an honest election only to huddle in fear with everyone else in a Capitol hideout when the rioters — in service of that plot — swarmed the marbled corridors of power Jan. 6, 2021. The prime-time setting for the committee hearing is a rarity and something of a throwback to an era when people gathered en masse at their televisions in the evening before video streaming atomized viewership. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the committee, set expectations that may be hard to live up to as the committee tries to renew the interest of this short-attention-span country in machinations that are nearly 18 months in the rearview mirror. The hazards in that mirror are closer than they appear, as committee members see it. “The hearings will tell a story that will really blow the roof off the House,” Raskin said in April. “Because it is a story of the most heinous and dastardly political offense ever organized by a president and his followers and his entourage in the history of the United States.” That offense? In short, he told a Washington forum, “an inside coup” coupled with a violent attack by “neo-fascists.” Trump is not expected at any of the hearings, but his words and actions will hang heavy over the proceedings as lawmakers look to place him at the center of the chaos. It seems highly plausible that he will find a way to rail against them that does not involve being under oath. The committee almost certainly will look to draw a tight connection between Trump’s vociferous rejections of the election results and his Jan. 6 rally outside the White House sending the angry crowd off to Capitol Hill. Free from the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, committee members are likely to try to show that the riot that ravaged the Capitol was not a spontaneous gathering but part of a broader conspiracy and a natural outgrowth of weeks of denunciations of democratic processes. Biden framed Jan. 6 and its aftermath in existential terms about the threat posed to democracy. It’s a “battle for the soul of America,” he said. But a president can only have one No. 1 priority at a time, and this isn’t his. Time and again, he’s said it’s inflation. Whatever revelations the hearings may produce, much is already known because the attack played out on screens large and small in real time, and Trump exhorted supporters to “fight like hell” in shouts for the world to hear. “In quieter times, the hearings would have a stronger hold on public attention,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania and an authority on political communications. “But, as is, they will be competing for attention with topics with greater immediate relevance in our lives.” Hungry babies lacking formula. Soaring prices for gas and groceries. Rising COVID-19 hospitalization among the vaccinated. The scenes of destruction in Ukraine and the threat that the Russian invasion will escalate to include use of nuclear weapons. And there’s monkeypox. “To say nothing of summer vacation,” Jamieson added. “If the hearings are to do anything other than reinforce our existing political biases,” she said, “they will have to reveal previously covered-up goings-on that threatened something that Democrats, independents and most Republicans can agree should be sacrosanct.” Some of the inquiry’s juicy bits are out already. Text messages and emails, thought to be private when sent, have become public, including from chief of staff Mark Meadows. But the committee has been sitting on much more information and will have tens of thousands of exhibits and hundreds of witnesses, said Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman. Seven Democrats and two Republicans — both shunned by their party — make up the committee. Among them the stakes are surely highest for Rep. Liz Cheney, the deeply conservative but fiercely independent Wyoming lawmaker who is practically alone in the GOP in assailing Trump while also seeking reelection to Congress. Daughter of a vice president and once an embodiment of the Republican establishment, she is now a renegade in a new order dominated by Trump, who wants her unseated in her primary in August. That new order became ever clearer in February, when the Republican Party censured Cheney and the committee’s other Republican, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who’s not seeking reelection, for taking part in the inquiry. The party adopted a resolution saying the witnesses summoned by the committee for their actions on and around Jan. 6 had only been engaging in “legitimate political discourse.” Matthew Delmont, a Dartmouth College history professor specializing in Black history, said Jan. 6 cast such an ominous shadow that he expects people in the United States, for all of their other pressing preoccupations, to be drawn to the inquiry. “I think people will watch the Jan. 6 hearings because they want to understand how our democracy reached this precipice,” he said. “I don’t know how many people will be willing to hear the evidence that will be presented, but I think it is important for the findings to be shared openly so people today and in the future can appreciate what happened.” Jan. 6 shares certain distinctions with other past agonies. As with 9/11, you can shorthand the date, Jan. 6, and people know. Like Watergate, it speaks to corrupt acts in the highest office. As with the Challenger space shuttle explosion and 9/11 and more, the scene brought so much visceral shock that many people remember where they were and what they were doing when they saw it. As far as the far right is concerned, the historical analogy is the Boston Tea Party, with liberals, Democrats and the Washington establishment as the redcoats. Trump-friendly Republicans sanitized what happened that day, once the shock that nearly all felt on Jan. 6 subsided. In measurements of public opinion, Republican voters in the main said they believe the 2020 election was rigged, when by absolutely all measures — the courts, nonpartisan and even Republican state officials, and the Trump administration’s own election monitors, including his attorney general — the election was purely fair. A year later, the patently violent uprising was remembered as very or extremely violent by fewer than 4 in 10 Republicans polled, compared with almost 9 in 10 Democrats. Even so, there were signs in the latest Republican primaries for the 2022 midterms that Trump’s obsession about getting fired by the voters all those months ago is wearing thin even with them. Trump won the 2016 election with a minority of voters, lost the House to the Democrats in 2018 and lost in 2020 by a decisive margin — not a glowing electoral record. Still he holds sway over his party, thanks to supporters whose loyalty seems immovable. Unswayed by facts throughout the fight to discredit and upend Biden’s election, they won’t be easily dislodged by a congressional committee’s revelations. Through Trump’s presidency, audacious falsehoods and elaborate exaggerations were the order of the day. But Trump, at times, had a knack for speaking a larger truth that penetrated his fog of hyperbole and misinformation. So it was with his comment in Iowa in January 2016, en route to the Republican nomination. The comment foretells that even if the Jan. 6 committee manages to “blow the roof off the House,” Trump may remain golden with millions who love him. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?” Trump said then. “It’s, like, incredible.” ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to show Trump lost the House, not the House and the Senate, in 2018.

11,Peter Navarro Ripped For Complaining That Being Arrested Wasn't Very Pleasant,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Peter Navarro, a top former White House adviser to Donald Trump, was up in arms Monday that he wasn’t given special treatment when he was arrested by the FBI last week for defying a subpoena issued by the House select committee investigating the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack. During an appearance on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” the former trade adviser claimed he was poorly treated during his brief time in custody on Friday. “People do not want to sit in solitary confinement in leg irons ― denied food, denied water, denied an attorney,” Navarro said. “This is what we live in.” Navarro appeared in court Friday afternoon before being released. He plans to represent himself, as a matter of principle, and because: “I do not want to spend several hundred thousand dollars on lawyers.” Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Navarro claimed the Justice Department had an “utter disregard of the Constitution and the law” and that authorities could have knocked on his door at home and asked him to go to court instead of arresting him while he was about to board a plane. Navarro complains that he was strip searched and denied food and water. pic.twitter.com/MAAcVHXz7W Navarro was charged with two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena issued in February demanding documents and testimony regarding the Capitol attack. He has claimed he was unable to cooperate due to executive privilege and said he would not do so until that privilege was waived by “the president” — referring to Trump, who can’t because he is not the president. President Joe Biden has refused to grant executive privilege to those targeted by the committee probing the insurrection. Navarro’s indictment marks the first time the Justice Department has pursued charges against a Trump administration official who was actively working in the White House on Jan. 6 and played a role in his crusade to overturn the 2020 election. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was also indicted last fall for defying a subpoena. Navarro was heavily involved in Trump’s scheme to stay in power and reportedly briefed Trump directly on debunked conspiracy theories about the election ahead of the Capitol attack. His complaints on Fox News about his arrest raised eyebrows online: When rightwing media relentlessly pretend traitors like Navarro are victims of prosecution remind them of their position on the treatment of George Floyd and ask them if everyone  in America is afforded the same sympathy and benefit of the doubt they reserve for fascist trumpers Why are the elite so appalled and shocked when they are arrested and treated like...everyone else? https://t.co/JLWdF5oVfB Don't crime and this won't happen. https://t.co/N9alxK9Anl If he followed the law to begin with he would not have been arrested. Of course he was strip searched. Everyone is. Food and water is on schedule. Not on demand. No lawyer is total bullshit. This guy is a traitor and a crook, crying to an idiot. America's sh*t show on TV. https://t.co/87KyHBFyHF Denied an attorney, food, water?  For how long?

12,Judge Blocks Louisiana Congress Map With One Black District,politics," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana’s Democratic governor said Monday he will call the Republican-dominated Legislature into special session soon to draw up new congressional district boundaries, now that a federal judge has blocked use of maps that have only one majority-Black district. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced his plan at a news conference at the Capitol in Baton Rouge. He spoke to reporters minutes after the 2022 regular legislative session ended, and a few hours after U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, also in Baton Rouge, blocked the use of the new maps. Her ruling included an order that the Legislature draw up with a remedial plan by June 20. Edwards, whose veto of the maps was overridden by lawmakers earlier this year, said there should have been a second majority-Black district among the six districts that were approved, noting that the state’s population is almost one-third Black. Edwards said redrawing the district lines is required by the court order, the Voting Rights Act and by “basic fairness and basic math.” But, lawyers for Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the state’s top elected official, swiftly filed a notice of appeal of Dick’s order. Dick’s June 20 deadline for drawing new district lines is one month before the signup period for the Nov. 8 congressional election. “If the Legislature is unable to pass a remedial plan by that date, the Court will issue additional orders to enact a remedial plan compliant with the laws and Constitution of the United States,” the judge wrote. The district map was drawn up in a special session earlier this year during a legislative special session called to redraw government district lines to account for population shifts show in the 2020 census. Edwards vetoed the maps but his veto was overridden. That led to a lawsuit by voting rights advocates. Ardoin filed a notice of appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Ultimately, the case could wind up before the Supreme Court, which earlier this year put on hold a lower court ruling that Alabama must draw new congressional districts before the 2022 elections to increase Black voting power. Ardoin’s office declined comment on the litigation. In blocking the use of the map pending further elections, Dick said those filing the lawsuit were likely to prevail with their argument that the new districts violate the federal Voting Rights Act. She blocked Ardoin from conducting any elections using the new map. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,"Memphis Politicians Object To Police Escort At Trump Rally, Citing Unpaid Bills",politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Members of the city council of Memphis, Tennessee, object to the city paying for police to escort Donald Trump to a nearby rally later this month because the former president doesn’t pay his bills. “He’s notorious for not paying,” Democratic City Council Member Martavius Jones noted last week to NBC affiliate Action News 5 in Memphis. “When you talk about these rallies, there are huge expenses that various jurisdictions have to pay, and these expenditures are not being reimbursed by the Trump campaign or Trump organization,” he added. The Center for Public Integrity reported in 2020 that Trump owed nearly $2 million at that time to 14 different police agencies and local governments for the services they provided at his rallies. Albuquerque, New Mexico, officials were so frustrated last year with a long-overdue $211,000 debt owed by the Trump campaign that they sent the bill directly to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort. El Paso, Texas, officials told KXAN-TV just last month that they’re still awaiting a $570,000 payment for the cost of a Trump reelection rally in 2019. The Trump rally on June 18 will be held in Southhaven, Mississippi, which is about a 20-minute drive from the Memphis airport. Jones and fellow Council Member JB Smiley, who’s running for Tennessee governor, plan to introduce a resolution Tuesday to the full council asking the Memphis Police Department not to provide any manpower or other resources for Trump’s appearance. “As we know, the Memphis Police Department is already experiencing a shortage of officers to patrol our communities. I do not believe that it is a prudent use of police manpower and Memphians’ taxpayer dollars to escort the former president to an event in Mississippi,” Smiley said in a statement. “He’s no longer the president.

14,Jan. 6 Panel Has Evidence Of A 'Lot More Than Incitement' Against Trump: Jamie Raskin,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump and the White House were “at the center” of events triggering last year’s violent Capitol insurrection, and the House Jan. 6 select committee has uncovered evidence against the former president “about a lot more than incitement,” panel member Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said on Monday. The panel will be “laying out the evidence about all of the actors who were pivotal to what took place on January 6th” at upcoming televised hearings beginning Thursday, the lawmaker vowed in an interview with Washington Post Live. Raskin emphasized that Trump was already impeached for inciting the violence of Jan. 6 last year, but the required two-thirds of the then-Republican-dominated Senate did not vote to convict him. Nevertheless, “commanding majorities found that he had, in fact, incited this insurrection,” Raskin noted. “But the select committee has found evidence about a lot more than incitement here,” he stresses in the video clip below. Raskin spoke to the Post the same day four leaders of the Trump-supporting Proud Boys were charged with felony seditious conspiracy for their roles in the planning and execution of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. On Sunday, legendary Watergate journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward also linked Trump to sedition, calling him the “first seditious president in our history.” Raskin told the Post that the Jan. 6 committee “has found evidence of concerted planning and premeditated activity.” “The idea that all of this was just a rowdy demonstration that spontaneously got a little bit out of control is absurd. You don’t almost knock over the U.S. government by accident,” he says in the clip below. Raskin said the committee hearings are “going to tell the story of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election and block the transfer of power.” This is an extraordinary and unprecedented event in our history,” he added. “You really have to go back to the Civil War to understand anything like it.” Any resulting charges against Trump for his role in the events of Jan. 6 will be up to the Department of Justice, Raskin noted. But he pointed out that in litigation concerning Trump ally and “coup memo” attorney John Eastman, federal U.S. District Judge David Carter “stated in a decision that it was ‘more likely than not’ Trump committed federal offenses” in his attempts to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Following the committee’s lengthy investigation involving some 1,000 witnesses and the examination of 125,000 documents, “we think that there is overwhelming evidence of this plan to overturn the 2020 presidential election in coordination with a violent assault on our body,” Raskin noted. “We’re going to lay it all out there, but the prosecutors are going to have to sort it out with respect to individual defendants ... I have confidence in the ability of the Department of Justice to do their job.” Read and listen to Raskin’s full interview here.

15,Democrats Urge Republicans On Gun Legislation: 'Put Up Or Shut Up',politics," Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers spoke at a rally with young anti-gun violence activists, urging their Republican colleagues in Congress to pass gun safety legislation. “To the United States Senate: Don’t look away,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) at a rally Monday outside the Capitol, organized by Students Demand Action. “To Republicans, let me be very blunt: We’re at a put up or shut up moment. We need to act,” the lawmaker added, noting that he and fellow Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy have been negotiating in Congress to try to pass bipartisan gun safety measures. The rally and lawmakers’ renewed efforts to pass anti-gun violence legislation follow the deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 21 people, including 19 children, aged 10 and 11 years old. That shooting was only 10 days after a white supremacist shot and killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo. And over the weekend, at least three people were killed and 11 wounded in a shooting in Philadelphia. It has been a decade since a gunman killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown — in Murphy and Blumenthal’s home state of Connecticut. With a couple dozen high school and college students donning bulletproof vests in the background as he spoke, Murphy told the crowd: “This country cannot look away as our schools and our neighborhoods become killing fields.” “You have to worry about whether you’re going to make it home from school safe,” Murphy said, adding that he has young sons. “No other children in the world have to think about that when they walk into their school other than in this country.” Murphy, who is leading the Senate gun control talks, said Democrats were in “very real discussions” with Republicans to “try to craft a bill that will make a difference.” This is our reality. This is American exceptionalism. Guns are the leading cause of death for children and teens, and every day the Senate fails to act, more people are shot.Don't let your senators look away. Text BOLD to 644-33 to call them & demand action now. #DontLookAway pic.twitter.com/8OMiH3J1mz The measures Democratic lawmakers are pushing would expand background checks, help states pass red flag laws and invest in local anti-gun violence initiatives. On Sunday, Murphy said he’d “never been part of negotiations as serious as these” on changing U.S. gun laws, but noted he wasn’t sure they’d be able to get enough Republican support to get the 60 votes necessary to raise the minimum age to purchase a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said at the rally Monday that it had been “too many years that this crisis has not been on the front of the agenda of Washington.” “We are a nation that believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he added. “You cannot have liberty when you fear your synagogue or church or mosque or grocery store will become a killing field.” Ade Osadolor, a student who identified as Afro-Latina, said at the rally that she had been deeply affected by the recent shootings in Uvalde, a predominantly Latinx community, and Buffalo, which targeted Black people. “Our generation has to live with the trauma of gun violence,” the young woman said. “We should not have to worry if we’ll make it out of school alive every day.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,New York Governor Signs 10 Gun Reform Laws After Spate Of Mass Shootings,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed 10 gun-related bills Monday that will bar those younger than 21 from buying or owning semi-automatic rifles, ban the purchase of body armor for most civilians and strengthen the state’s red flag laws, among other provisions. The landmark package is one of the first major efforts by a state to pass new gun control legislation after a spate of mass shootings across the nation, including the deadly massacre that left 21 people dead — 19 of which were young children — in Uvalde, Texas, last month. New York had a mass shooting just days before when a gunman opened fired at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo. The shooter killed 10 people in what authorities described as “hate-filled domestic terrorism.” Democrats in the New York Legislature approved the 10-bill package of gun legislation last week. The laws will also mandate microstamping on some new firearms to help authorities solve gun-related crimes. “I’m speaking to you today as the Governor of a state in mourning and the citizen of a nation in crisis. For over the past few weeks, we’ve been overcome by grief, by heartache, by anger,” Hochul said Monday. “In New York, we are taking bold, strong action. We’re tightening the red flag laws to keep guns away from dangerous people. And we’re raising the age of semi-automatic weapons so no 18-year-old can walk in on their birthday and walk out with an AR-15. Those days are over.” For our neighbors in Buffalo and across the country, we cannot grow complacent, we cannot grow numb and we cannot tolerate inaction on common sense gun reform any longer.The 10 bills I signed into law today are the start of our work to stop these tragedies — not the end. pic.twitter.com/awokEF8Ec3 The legislation’s passage was hailed by gun reform groups. “These bills are common-sense,” Kris Brown, president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said in a statement. “They will address gun violence in all of its forms and do so while respecting residents’ Second Amendment rights. This package of laws will help to keep New Yorkers safe and are a clear example for the rest of the nation to act to stop gun violence.” Democrats in Congress have been trying to pass some semblance of gun reform since the string of mass shootings, but have struggled to field any major proposals that would pass the Senate with Democrats’ narrow, 50-50 majority there (for which Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote). A bipartisan group of senators is working on a modest effort that would include watered-down background checks for gun purchases. Hochul said Monday that New York would continue to work to rein in gun violence, urging Congress to follow the state’s lead “and take immediate action to pass meaningful gun violence prevention measures.” “Thoughts and prayers won’t fix this,” she said. “But taking strong action will. And we’ll do that in the name of the lives that have been lost.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,New York Governor Signs 10 Gun Reform Laws After Spate Of Mass Shootings,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed 10 gun-related bills Monday that will bar those younger than 21 from buying or owning semi-automatic rifles, ban the purchase of body armor for most civilians and strengthen the state’s red flag laws, among other provisions. The landmark package is one of the first major efforts by a state to pass new gun control legislation after a spate of mass shootings across the nation, including the deadly massacre that left 21 people dead — 19 of which were young children — in Uvalde, Texas, last month. New York had a mass shooting just days before when a gunman opened fired at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo. The shooter killed 10 people in what authorities described as “hate-filled domestic terrorism.” Democrats in the New York Legislature approved the 10-bill package of gun legislation last week. The laws will also mandate microstamping on some new firearms to help authorities solve gun-related crimes. “I’m speaking to you today as the Governor of a state in mourning and the citizen of a nation in crisis. For over the past few weeks, we’ve been overcome by grief, by heartache, by anger,” Hochul said Monday. “In New York, we are taking bold, strong action. We’re tightening the red flag laws to keep guns away from dangerous people. And we’re raising the age of semi-automatic weapons so no 18-year-old can walk in on their birthday and walk out with an AR-15. Those days are over.” For our neighbors in Buffalo and across the country, we cannot grow complacent, we cannot grow numb and we cannot tolerate inaction on common sense gun reform any longer.The 10 bills I signed into law today are the start of our work to stop these tragedies — not the end. pic.twitter.com/awokEF8Ec3 The legislation’s passage was hailed by gun reform groups. “These bills are common-sense,” Kris Brown, president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said in a statement. “They will address gun violence in all of its forms and do so while respecting residents’ Second Amendment rights. This package of laws will help to keep New Yorkers safe and are a clear example for the rest of the nation to act to stop gun violence.” Democrats in Congress have been trying to pass some semblance of gun reform since the string of mass shootings, but have struggled to field any major proposals that would pass the Senate with Democrats’ narrow, 50-50 majority there (for which Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote). A bipartisan group of senators is working on a modest effort that would include watered-down background checks for gun purchases. Hochul said Monday that New York would continue to work to rein in gun violence, urging Congress to follow the state’s lead “and take immediate action to pass meaningful gun violence prevention measures.” “Thoughts and prayers won’t fix this,” she said. “But taking strong action will. And we’ll do that in the name of the lives that have been lost.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Marjorie Taylor Greene's New Intern Once Appeared To Condone Pedophilia,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has baselessly accused many of her fellow lawmakers of being “pro-pedophile,” has hired a new intern, a 37-year-old man known for two things: his rise to fame for being toxic online, and his fall from the public eye after appearing to condone pedophilia. The intern in question: far-right hatemonger Milo Yiannopoulos. Right Wing Watch flagged the hire Monday, following up on a sighting earlier this year of Yiannopoulos alongside Greene at a press conference. Milo Yiannopoulos posted an image on his Telegram account confirming that he is working in Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's congressional office as an intern. https://t.co/WwJNqtdhCm pic.twitter.com/I8NG2hLAbk Greene confirmed the hire to The Daily Beast via a spokesperson Monday. “I have an intern that was raped by a priest as a young teen, was gay, has offended everyone at some point, turned his life back to Jesus and Church, and changed his life,” Greene told the Beast. “Great story!” Yiannopoulos, a onetime darling of the far right, is a questionable hire for anyone ― especially a lawmaker who (like a growing number of others in her party) claims to be very worried about the threat of predators “grooming” children, and who has accused various Democrats and Republicans alike of being “pro-pedophile.” In 2017, after having made any number of racist, sexist and transphobic remarks, Yiannopoulos finally saw his speaking appearances and a lucrative book deal canceled when a video surfaced in which he appeared to condone sexual relationships between adults and 13-year-old boys. In that video, Yiannopoulos, who until recently identified as gay, told a podcast interviewer that “we get hung up on this kind of child abuse stuff,” and argued that in “some of those relationships between younger boys and older men ... those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love.” Yiannopoulos later said the video had been selectively edited, and condemned pedophilia as “a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst.” However, other videos have emerged of him making similarly equivocal statements. In another video, Yiannopoulos argued that sex with a 13-year-old doesn’t constitute pedophilia, because “pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet who have not gone through puberty.” That’s a sharp contrast to Greene’s stated beliefs. Earlier on Monday, before the news of her new hire broke, she tweeted: “We must protect children from child grooming predators & abusers in every way possible.” I could care less what 2 consenting adults do sexually, nor do I judge, but when it comes to adults training children sexually, both mentally & physically, I do care.And so do MOST people.We must protect children from child  grooming predators & abusers in every way possible.

3,Proud Boys Leaders Indicted On Seditious Conspiracy Charges Over Capitol Attack,politics," Senior Editor, HuffPost Five members of the Proud Boys street gang — including their leader, Enrique Tarrio — were indicted Monday on seditious conspiracy charges for their role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., returned the rare indictment, which charges that Tarrio and four other members of the Proud Boys — Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola — played an outsize role in the planning and execution of the insurrection. A sixth Proud Boy, Charles Donohoe, wasn’t included because he’d already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in a plea deal that will force him to testify against his fellow gang members. Dozens of Proud Boys were among the thousands of people who stormed the U.S. Capitol that day in an effort to stop the certification of Joe Biden as president. Prosecutors say that Tarrio and his fellow defendants were instrumental in the planning stages of the attack; Tarrio allegedly looked over a document titled “1776 Returns” on Dec. 30, 2020, detailing plans to occupy several buildings in Washington on Jan. 6, including six House and Senate office buildings. Tarrio didn’t join his gang on the day of the insurrection — he was under court order to stay away from D.C. following his arrest over other crimes he committed with the Proud Boys in December — but the other members led the charge. They stood at the front of a massive throng that marched to the Capitol following a speech by defeated President Donald Trump, joined by members of the Oath Keepers, a self-described “militia” that often shows up to Proud Boys events, whose leaders are also facing seditious conspiracy charges. Several people died as a result of the attack on the Capitol, including police officers, and hundreds more were injured. Seditious conspiracy is serious and rarely prosecuted. It holds that two or more people not only conspired to carry out an attack, but did so with an intention to “overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States.” The seditious conspiracy charges will be slapped on top of the conspiracy charges each member already faced. They’re scheduled to appear together in court on June 9. The indictment comes the same week that a House committee tasked with investigating the events of Jan. 6 is prepared to hold its first hearings. Andy Campbell is the author of forthcoming book “We Are Proud Boys: How A Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In A New Era Of American Extremism,” coming to bookstores on Oct. 4, 2022.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,politics," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,politics," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",politics," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,politics," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,politics," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

10,Jill Biden Helps Unveil Nancy Reagan Postage Stamp,politics," WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden on Monday praised Nancy Reagan as a first lady who “made such a difference,” as the current first lady hosted the unveiling of a new U.S. postage stamp honoring a woman who held the role 40 years before Biden stepped into it. The issuance by the U.S. Postal Service of a forever first-class stamp bearing Nancy Reagan’s image is part of a yearlong commemoration of the former first lady’s centennial by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. At a White House ceremony, Biden talked about the “incredible platform” first ladies gain to serve the people after “we’re just sort of thrust into the national spotlight in a way that I know none of us could have anticipated.” “First lady Nancy Reagan served the American people with grace,” Biden said. “She understood that the role of first lady came with inherent pitfalls and scrutiny, yet she found the humanity in it all. She knew the potential of this role.” “Next month would have been her 101st birthday,” Biden continued. “And with this stamp we are affirming that she made such a difference.” Nancy Reagan was born on July 6, 1921. Fred Ryan, a White House aide to President Ronald Reagan, said the former first lady advocated for foster grandparents, championed the arts, and restored and remodeled parts of the White House. She is also remembered for her “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign, for undergoing a mastectomy after her breast cancer diagnosis during the Reagan presidency and a fierce devotion to her husband. But the White House announcement last week of Monday’s event sparked angry commentary on social media by people who noted the Reagans’ indifference toward gays and lesbians and to the AIDS crisis that exploded during their time as president and first lady. Other commentators expressed indignation that the White House under a Democratic president hosted the event at all, let alone during Pride Month, which celebrates LGBTQ people. Jill Biden’s office did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Last week, President Joe Biden issued a Pride Month proclamation in which he said the rights of LGBTQI people currently are under “relentless attack” and sought to reassure them that “my administration sees you for who you are, deserving of dignity, respect and support.” In her remarks, Jill Biden spoke of the need for everyone to help “bring our communities together.” “We have to learn from those we don’t understand, to reach across the divide and find common ground, because that’s where the foundation of our future must be laid,” she said. Also participating in the unveiling were U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Anne Peterson, Nancy Reagan’s niece. Ryan also is chairman of the board of trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. Nancy Reagan is the sixth first lady to appear on a U.S. postage stamp after Martha Washington, Dolley Madison, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and Lady Bird Johnson, DeJoy said. The stamp is set to officially be issued on July 6 during a dedication at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, he said. Nancy Reagan died in March 2016 at the age of 94.

12,"House Democrat To Propose 1,000% Tax On Assault-Style Weapons",politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost In the wake of another weekend of deadly mass shootings, which saw 15 Americans killed across eight states, House Democrats are stepping up their efforts to bring in gun safety measures. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) is set to propose legislation that would impose an 1,000% tax on assault-style weapons, including AR-15s, hoping to curb future gun sales without banning them. “What it’s intended to do is provide another creative pathway to actually make some sensible gun control happen,” Beyer told Insider. “We think that a 1,000% fee on assault weapons is just the kind of restrictive measure that creates enough fiscal impact to qualify for reconciliation.” Beyer’s office told The Hill his proposal would cover assault-style weapons as defined in the “Assault Weapons Ban” bill brought forward by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) last year. That legislation includes 205 military-style assault weapons by name, along with any assault weapon with a magazine that is not a fixed ammunition magazine and has one or more military characteristics and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, according to a statement from March. Beyer’s bill would exempt law enforcement and the U.S. military from the tax. House Democrats are pushing for multiple pieces of gun control legislation in the wake of deadly mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, last month, including the Protect Our Kids Act. The package is meant to address the age requirement for gun sales, preventing the trafficking of guns and closing the bump stock loophole, among other measures. But this type of package is unlikely to pass the Senate, where Republicans can easy filibuster legislation. Senators are working on their own bill, but have yet to finalize a deal. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who is leading bipartisan talks in the Senate, said there are outstanding issues for legislators to discuss, adding there is not enough support within the chamber for raising the age limit to 21. Still, Murphy said this is the first time talks on guns have been as significant. “I’ve never been part of negotiations as serious as these,” Murphy told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “We are talking about a meaningful change in our gun laws, a major investment in mental health, perhaps some money for school security that would make a difference,” Murphy added. “On the table is red flag laws, changes to our background check system to improve the existing system, a handful of other items that will make a difference.” President Joe Biden has distanced himself from the negotiations to give legislators “some space,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday. Biden explained his approach Friday. “My staff is dealing and have been dealing constantly with every member of the House and Senate who is wanting to talk about guns,” Biden said. “It’s been a constant interchange. And I’ve been constantly briefed.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Bipartisan Gun Negotiations Include Watered-Down Background Checks,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — The bipartisan group of senators working on a gun control bill say their framework includes an expansion of criminal background checks — but the policy may be more modest than past proposals. After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, a bipartisan proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) would have expanded background checks to cover gun sales through internet advertisements and at gun shows. As it stands now, only licensed gun dealers have to do background checks, and private sellers don’t. The Democrat leading this year’s bipartisan negotiations said he was hoping to include comprehensive background checks like Manchin and Toomey proposed, but that he would have to sacrifice other priorities in order to make it happen. “We’re not going to put a piece of legislation the table that’s going to ban assault weapons, or we’re not going to pass comprehensive background checks,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Toomey, for his part, suggested the background check proposal the group is working on would look “different” from what he’d developed with Manchin. He described specifics over the background check proposal that’s being discussed as a “moving target.” Murphy expressed hope that a narrow deal on guns would open the door to broader reform by showing Republicans that their willingness to engage on the issue is politically popular. The Manchin-Toomey bill failed by six votes needed for passage when the Senate considered it in 2013. Four Republican senators voted for it at the time. Toomey and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) are the only Republicans who voted for the proposal who are still in the Senate. Manchin has said he thinks the current gun talks, prompted by massacres in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, are more serious than last time. But the proposals under consideration seem to be much weaker, largely due to hardened Republican opposition to any gun reforms. In fact, many GOP lawmakers argue that no new laws would prevent people from committing gun crimes. Republicans have said their main goals are to boost school security, address the “mental health” issues that contribute to mass shootings and encourage states to enact “red flag” laws allowing police to temporarily confiscate weapons from dangerous people. The background check change Murphy described Sunday involved putting juvenile records into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Checks system. The shooters in Uvalde and Buffalo were both 18-year-olds who legally purchased their assault rifles. “Often, those juvenile records aren’t accessible when they walk into the gun store buying as an adult,” Murphy said. “So we’re having a conversation about that specific population, 18 to 21, and how to make sure that only the right people, law-abiding citizens, are getting their hands on weapons.” Congress recently raised the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21 but a similar change for buying firearms seems likely to be omitted from a Senate deal. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) extended an informal deadline for the talks to the end of this week. The House of Representatives approved a bill last month that would require a background check for almost any gun sale by requiring sellers to first transfer firearms to licensed dealers before completing a transaction. Such “universal” background checks aren’t even part of the conversation in the Senate, which is the chamber that will ultimately decide whether a bill gets passed and what it looks like. Expanding background checks is one of the most popular policy options in front of Congress. In an Ipsos survey last month, 84% of voters, including 82% of Republicans, said they supported expanded background checks. It’s not hard to see why, since background checks are just a way of ensuring that gun sellers follow the law. Federal law disallows firearm sales to certain people, including those who have been convicted of felonies and people who are subject to court orders related to domestic abuse. But if a prohibited person is buying the gun from an acquaintance, or a stranger on the internet, or a hobbyist at a gun show, then the seller doesn’t have to check their background. It’s not clear if a Manchin-Toomey-style proposal is actually on the table. “I don’t know that we’ll get exactly what Sen. Manchin and I developed some years ago, it’d probably be something different than that. Toomey said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “But I just think it makes sense. We all agree that violent criminals and deranged, dangerously mentally ill people shouldn’t have firearms. So we need a mechanism to increase the likelihood that will identify such a person and prevent them from buying a gun legally.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told HuffPost on Monday that a background check expansion like Manchin-Toomey from 2013 “would be a heavy lift.” He declined to be specific but said, “I think that what we’re trying to do is a more accurate and complete background check.” Clarification: An earlier version of this story omitted Sen. Chris Murphy’s full quote on assault weapons and background checks. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,Herschel Walker's Pitch For 'Mist' That Magically Kills COVID Targeted In Campaign Ad,politics," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A pitch by former NFL star Herschel Walker for a mystery “mist” that he claimed eliminates COVID-19 is raining on his campaign to represent Georgia in the Senate. Walker’s wild plug on a Glenn Beck podcast in 2020 is the target of a campaign attack ad by Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock. In the pitch, Walker fails to heed his own advice that “I’m going to say something that probably I shouldn’t” — then makes the “snake oil” claims, as The Daily Beast first reported early this year. “You know, right now I have something that can bring you into a building that would clean you from COVID as you walk through this dry mist,” Walker says. “As you walk through the door it will kill any COVID on your body. When you leave the building it will kill the virus.” He didn’t name the product. Warnock’s ad accuses Walker of pushing “snake oil body spray for COVID” and asks: Is he “really ready to represent Georgia?” Sen.

15,Rep. Liz Cheney Offers Chilling Preview Of Jan. 6 Hearings,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a co-chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, said Sunday the panel’s discoveries have made her even more concerned about the dangers to U.S. democracy. “It’s an ongoing threat,” Cheney said in an interview on CBS News of efforts to delegitimize U.S. elections by former President Donald Trump and his allies. “It is extremely broad. It’s extremely well organized. It’s really chilling.” “I have not learned anything that has made me less concerned,” she said. Cheney, a prominent Trump critic who voted to impeach him last year, is one of two Republicans on the panel. She was ousted from her leadership position in the party after she repeatedly spoke out against the former president and his lies about the 2020 election, and faces a Trump-backed challenger to her reelection. The committee probing the attack will hold six public hearings this month. It will lay out findings from more than 1,000 interviews and 100,000 pages of documents related to Trump’s crusade to stay in power. Cheney said she was confident that the committee’s findings would wake people up. “People must pay attention. People must watch, and they must understand how easily our democratic system can unravel if we don’t defend it,” she said. The first hearing will be Thursday at 8 p.m. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,How Ryan Zinke Went Full Trump,politics," Environment Reporter, HuffPost In 1976, a freshman jock and self-proclaimed “health nut” named Ryan Zinke ran for student body president on a pledge to bring a fruit stand to his rural high school in Whitefish, Montana. It proved to be a winning platform. But in an interview shortly after his triumph, Zinke acknowledged that his motivation was not so much giving his classmates a healthy alternative to the school’s popular candy machine. “Mainly it was a campaign move to get elected,” the 15-year-old, 6-foot-3 football, wrestling and swimming star told The Missoulian newspaper. Zinke has been doing and saying what it takes to get ahead ever since. The former Navy SEAL, state senator, congressman and Trump administration Cabinet member is once again on the campaign trail, this time running for Montana’s newly created House seat. The prohibitive front-runner, Zinke is among a group of former high-ranking Trump administration officials with a shot at entering elected office despite their roles in an unpopular, disastrous administration and their loyalty to a former president who went to great lengths to try to overturn a fair, legal election. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary for President Donald Trump, is the favorite for Arkansas’ next governor. Scott Pruitt, Trump’s scandal-plagued Environmental Protection Agency chief, is running for Senate in Oklahoma. Zinke is pitching himself as a “patriot” who can “save America” — from what he calls President Joe Biden’s “disastrous” energy and economic policies; from government overreach and the “COVID industrial complex”; from the “swamp” of lobbyists and influence in Washington, D.C., that his former boss vowed repeatedly to “drain” only to flood with industry alligators. Zinke often jokes that the swamp was one of the few issues he and Trump disagreed on. “I said, Mr. President, I’m secretary of the interior. There are some beautiful swamps in America,” Zinke chuckled during a January interview with the conservative podcast “District of Conservation.” “DC is not a swamp, it’s a sewer.” Swamp or sewer or “cesspool,” Zinke is asking Montana voters to send him back to a place he has benefited immensely from, professionally and financially. Running as if he is unopposed, Zinke has largely walled himself off from both the press and his would-be constituents. He grants interviews almost exclusively to right-wing outlets and radio hosts, where he can count on softball questions, and did not show up to a single candidate forum ahead of Tuesday’s primary, including one last month in his hometown of Whitefish. Zinke’s campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for an interview. Despite his Trump credentials, Zinke is one of five candidates on the Republican ticket Tuesday — each of them trying to out-Trump the others. Zinke’s loyalty to Trump has paid off: The ex-president endorsed Zinke in the race, as did Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) and Sen. Steve Daines (R). While there hasn’t been any polling on the race, FiveThirtyEight.com currently gives Republicans a 10-point advantage to win the newly created congressional seat in November. In 2020, Trump won Montana by 16 points and Democrats lost every single statewide race. Zinke is perhaps best known as a key soldier in Trump’s fossil fuel-centric energy crusade. He likes to portray himself as an “all-of-the-above” energy guy, someone who supports fossil fuels and renewables alike and doesn’t pick favorites when it comes to powering America. But his tenure at the helm of an agency that oversees roughly one-fifth of all land in the U.S. proved to be one massive gift to the fossil fuel industry — a top donor to his past and current congressional bids. Despite repeated assurances to prioritize conservation and create a legacy that would rival that of his hero President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke spent his days at the Interior Department loyally advancing Trump’s pro-extraction, anti-conservation agenda. He helped dismantle a slew of environmental protections and opened up millions of federal acres to drilling and mining. He dismissed and downplayed the threat of climate change and railed against “radical environmentalists.” By the end of his two-year stint, he sounded like a seasoned fossil fuel executive, at times referring to America’s oil and gas industry as “we.” The industry took notice. Weeks after resigning from the Cabinet post in January 2019 — or, reportedly, being forced out — under a cloud of ethics scandals, Zinke began cashing in. First, he landed a job as senior vice president of Artillery One, a little-known blockchain investment firm, after a serendipitous flight to Atlanta during which he sat next to and wooed the company’s chief executive with stories of achieving so-called “energy independence.” Weeks after that, he and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski joined lobbying firm Turnberry Solutions as senior advisers. And in April of that year, Zinke was tapped as a board member of mining exploration company U.S. Gold Corp. and promised to “help make mining great again in America.” It was not until nearly two years later, however, that the public learned just how much Zinke benefited from special interests following his departure from government, including companies he’d spent two years regulating. In November, months after it was due, Zinke’s campaign filed the financial disclosure that is required of all congressional candidates. It revealed Zinke was paid a combined $1.36 million for consulting and other services in the two years after leaving the Trump administration. That included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from U.S. Gold Corp., and at least $5,000 each from several fossil fuel interests, including pipeline company US Trinity, exploration and hydraulic fracturing company Oasis Petroleum, and Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an Oklahoma-based oil and gas lobbying firm that’s headed by oil billionaire and rabid Trump supporter Harold Hamm. “Certainly, his bread was buttered with petroleum jelly.” Zinke also reported $410,000 in income from a company listed as “JVL Enterprises” of Dallas. HuffPost could find no active JVL Enterprises in Dallas. Reached by phone, James Van Lare, who owned a JVL Ventures LLC outside Dallas and donated to Zinke’s campaign in June 2021, told HuffPost his company is no longer active and that he did not pay Zinke for consulting services. A review of Texas companies with “JVL” in their names leaves little doubt it was JVL Advisors, LLC, an oil and gas investment firm in Houston, that Zinke consulted for. The company’s founder and managing partner, John Lovoi, sits on the board of several other fossil fuel companies, including Roan Resources, Epsilon Energy, Helix Energy Solutions and Dril-Quip. Lovoi did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Zinke’s post-government honeymoon with big oil was predictable to anyone who closely followed his tenure at Interior. And his deep ties to planet-warming fossil fuels have taken center stage in the race for Montana’s new House seat, which was created last year and covers the western part of the state. Monica Tranel, one of three Democrats running to take on Zinke in November’s general election, wrote a letter to ConocoPhillips in April urging the company to drop Zinke from its payroll as a “symbolic” gesture of “belt-tightening” as Montanans struggle to afford high gas prices. Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Zinke’s campaign, fired back on Twitter, saying that Zinke had ended his relationship with the company months earlier to focus on the campaign. A ConocoPhillips spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost that Zinke was paid for consulting and advisory services until December 2021, but did not elaborate on the specifics of Zinke’s work for the company. That means that for approximately eight months after launching his campaign in April 2021, Zinke was collecting a hefty paycheck from one of the nation’s largest oil companies while running for public office on a vow to restore so-called “energy dominance.” During that time, Zinke often took to social media to complain about rising gas prices, peddle industry talking points and wish lists, demand more drilling amid rapidly worsening, fossil fuel-driven planetary warming, and even publicly ponder absurd, oil-friendly questions like “What happens when the wind runs out?” I'm all for clean energy - and solar and wind must be part of our energy mix where it makes sense - but we need other affordable and reliable options to power our current energy needs. pic.twitter.com/EeL2sduyIG On social media, Zinke frequently blames Biden for pain at the pump, ignoring the fact that domestic gas prices are inherently tied to a global market and that oil majors, including his recent client ConocoPhillips, have raked in record profits amid high prices. In an August 2021 interview with the right-wing Breitbart News, Zinke talked about the need for Americans to “rally together” and “learn to work together,” then slammed Biden’s energy policies as “anti-American,” bragged of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost oil and gas production and applauded American oil companies as “good players.” The interview allowed Zinke to plug and solicit donations for his congressional campaign, but included no mention that his clients at the time included ConocoPhillips. Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign, told HuffPost it is egregious that Zinke was collecting paychecks from the oil industry — “certainly, his bread was buttered with petroleum jelly,” he said — while simultaneously campaigning against the high gas prices that have led to skyrocketing oil industry profits. ConocoPhillips tallied $8.1 billion in profits in 2021, its most since 2013, and a stunning $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022. “If you’re running for Congress and asking people to be for you because you want to be their servant while you are getting paid as an adviser to a profiteering oil company, there’s some question about where your allegiance lies,” Barrett said. As with previous campaigns, Zinke has collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations from the fossil fuel industry. Through mid-May, he raised nearly $3 million, far more than any other candidate in the race. More than $124,000 of that came from industry employees and political action committees, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. Zinke’s largest donors include Cox Oil, oil and gas investment firm Colt Ventures, Hauptman Oil and Double Eagle Energy. Harold Hamm, the founder and chair of Continental Resources, gave Zinke $2,900. And several of Zinke’s former Interior colleagues — who, much like him, have spun through the revolving door to land jobs in industry or lobbying — have also supported his campaign. a few donations to Ryan Zinke's campaignBernhardt, Bloomgren & DeVito were all top Trump DOI officials & spun through the revolving🚪to land jobs in industry or lobbyingBernhardt: Brownstein HyattBloomgren: APIDeVito: Cox Oil(notice DeVito's dollar amount: 1776) pic.twitter.com/0Vyc3qannQ Zinke is leaning hard into his energy bona fides. He boasts often about how he and Trump made the U.S. “energy independent.” In a statement endorsing Zinke for the seat, Trump wrote that under Zinke’s leadership, “the U.S. achieved Energy Dominance, increased federal energy revenues, and responsibly opened federal acreage for energy production.” Zinke hasn’t defined what “energy independent” means; if he’s talking about a nation free of any imported petroleum products, the U.S. never achieved that under Trump. “Want to make gas cheap again, vote Zinke,” he wrote in an April post while filling a 30-gallon, gas-guzzling pickup truck with premium gasoline. A post shared by Ryan Zinke (@zinkeformontana) Along with restoring the U.S. as an oil and gas juggernaut — it’s unclear how he plans to do that as one of 435 members of the House — Zinke says his bid is about taking on division across the country. He cited those political fissures as his primary motivation for running, calling it “the biggest threat facing the country.” In other words, he’s campaigning on a pledge to unite Montana and the country around conservative values — his values. But those who have closely watched Zinke’s 14-year ascent up the political ranks say those values have been a moving target, his views shifting ever farther to the right as Montana’s political landscape changed and the Republican Party became handcuffed to Trumpian ideology. Political experts and observers in Big Sky Country that HuffPost talked to — a number of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly — described Zinke as an “opportunist,” a “political chameleon” and someone “you have trouble figuring out what he believes.” “He morphs into whatever he needs to, whatever is politically advantageous,” said Jayson O’Neill, a Montana resident, conservation consultant and former aide to former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer. In 2008, after 23 years in the Navy SEALS, Zinke retired and returned to Montana to launch a political career. That year, he ran and was elected to represent his hometown of Whitefish and parts of Flathead County in the Montana state Senate — a seat previously held by Democrat Dan Weinberg. Located in Montana’s mountainous northwest, Whitefish is a resort ski town and a gateway to popular Glacier National Park. Politically, it is a blueish island in a darkening sea of red. Zinke presented himself as a moderate, conservation-minded Republican and public land champion in the mold of Roosevelt. He approached the head of the Montana chapter of the League of Conservation Voters and assured him that he “wasn’t one to buckle under pressure,” the Flathead Beacon reported, and ultimately earned a rare endorsement from the environmental group. “I am about jobs. I am about conservation,” Zinke said in an interview shortly after taking office, in which he talked about his fondness for Roosevelt. “I think he got the word from someone that he better trim his sails on environmental stuff if he wanted to win a Republican nomination. He appeared to do that.” As a freshman state senator, Zinke drove a red Toyota Prius. He sponsored bills and backed legislation that found little support among hard-line conservatives. And in 2010, he signed on to a letter urging President Barack Obama and congressional leaders to ”pass comprehensive clean energy jobs and climate change legislation.” The letter called climate and the energy transition “America’s new space race,” and highlighted the national security and economic risks of failing to take aggressive action to confront the threat. Zinke found himself on stable footing with local environmentalists. In its 2011 report card, Montana Conservation Voters gave Zinke a 60% score — a six-point improvement over his 2009 grade and the highest mark of any Republican that session — and applauded him for “standing up for clean water and energy security in Montana.” Similarly, the Montana Environmental Information Center gave Zinke a 53% score. That session, Zinke voted against a bill that would have weakened the Montana Environmental Policy Act and was just one of two Republicans to oppose a referendum aimed at weakening Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. But Zinke had his sights set on higher office, and it didn’t take long for him to start molting his moderate feathers. “I think he got the word from someone that he better trim his sails on environmental stuff if he wanted to win a Republican nomination,” said Chuck Johnson, a retired journalist who covered Montana politics for more than four decades. “He appeared to do that.” “He started realizing that in order to get ahead in the Republican Party, he had to be more conservative, especially to win a primary,” said another longtime Montana political observer who requested anonymity. In 2012, Zinke ran unsuccessfully for Montana’s lieutenant governorship on a ticket with gubernatorial candidate and eccentric businessman Neil Livingstone. As Mother Jone reported, Livingstone’s campaign bio boasted of having partied with pirates, “dined at gangster clubs in Moscow and in the back rooms of Georgian and Uzbek restaurants with members of the Russian Mafia” and being “stalked by terrorists and Nazis in Argentina.” Livingstone never stood much chance of winning. And some saw Zinke’s decision to join the ticket as little more than an opportunity to boost his name recognition and test the waters for statewide office. In doing so, however, Zinke undermined his brand as a defender of America’s public lands. He and Livingstone each signed the Montana Constitutional Governance Pledge, an extreme document that, among other things, supported handing over control of federal lands to states and dismissed the federal agencies that Zinke would later oversee as “bureaucracies that have sprung up to enforce the unlawful seizure of our native land and its resources.” That pledge was the beginning of a slow but steady shift away from the moderate Republican unafraid to buck his own party — a shift that Zinke has managed to convince many hasn’t taken place. Barrett, the Democratic adviser, was working for Schweitzer when Zinke was a state senator. He said he and Zinke had a positive working relationship, that Zinke was pragmatic, someone who would reach across the aisle to get things done, and that he considered him a “bit of a friend.” He subcribes to the theory that Zinke chose not to run for a third term in the state Senate in 2012 because, by then, the Republican Party in Flathead County had moved far to his right and there was concern his moderate record would not survive a primary challenge. In 2014, two years after stepping away from politics, Zinke launched his first successful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. Barrett said it quickly became clear that Zinke had himself moved to the right. During one campaign stop in January 2014, he famously called Hillary Clinton the “Antichrist” and the “real enemy.” “I can’t say whether that was calculated or genuine, whether he’d drunk the Kool-Aid or was only pretending he’d drunk the Kool-Aid,” Barrett said of Zinke’s shift. Either way, it worked. Over his two-plus years in Congress, Zinke emerged as a reliable pro-industry, anti-environment vote. He tallied an abysmal 4% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters; a record that no doubt appealed to Trump and his team. “I can’t say ... whether he’d drunk the Kool-Aid or was only pretending he’d drunk the Kool-Aid.” Still, Zinke’s nomination to lead the Interior Department found support among hunting, fishing and wildlife conservation groups. Many saw Zinke as the most palatable name on a shortlist that included oil tycoon Forrest Lucas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and they hung their hats on Zinke’s decision in 2016 to resign as a delegate to the Republican National Convention over the party’s support for transferring control of federal lands to states. Zinke ultimately sailed through the Senate confirmation process, with 17 members of the Democratic caucus voting in support. After being sworn in, Zinke arrived for his first day as Interior chief wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat and riding a horse named Tonto and pledged to “faithfully uphold Teddy Roosevelt’s belief that our treasured public lands are ‘for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.’” In the end, however, his legacy was not one of conservation stewardship, but of catering to extractive industries, gutting safeguards for the environment and imperiled species and championing the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history. Along the way, he racked up nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions, lost the support of many in the outdoor sporting and conservation community and drew comparisons to Regan-era Interior Secretary James Watt, widely considered among the most anti-environment Cabinet appointees in U.S. history. As Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the president, put it in an interview with HuffPost shortly before Zinke’s resignation in late 2018: Zinke’s “bad angels won out.” Now back on the campaign trail, Zinke is clinging to his Roosevelt-style brand while embracing Trumpian “America First” jingoism and painting himself a victim of a coordinated, left-wing attack. A proud veteran, Zinke talks about his own political journey as if he’s still on a battlefield. He likes to joke about how serving as a SEAL was easier than leading the Interior Department because “when people shot at you as a SEAL, you could shoot back.” He boasts often about how he’d “rather charge up a hill under fire than cower in a foxhole.” And The Associated Press reported that at a recent Republican dinner in Butte, Zinke dubbed himself the “battleship” of the District 1 race and all other candidates as “canoes.” “Everybody wants to shoot at the battleship. Nobody shoots at the canoes,” he said. I live by Theodore Roosevelt’s ethos that it’s better to charge up the hill under fire than cower in the fox hole. I’ve taken a lot of fire, but I’m not backing down: https://t.co/vSO5uYiOIo pic.twitter.com/xqnKh843KY In Zinke’s mind, everyone is out to get him — political opponents, the media and Washington itself. In interviews with right-wing media, he frequently rants about “the resistance movement,” “entrenched bureaucracy,” the so-called “Deep State” and “cancel culture” he says he faced in D.C., including among Interior Department staff. “When you drain the swamp, it exposes serpents. And they attack!” he said in a recent campaign-style video posted to Instagram. “As interior secretary, I got an extra dose of fake news and false charges. And now, running for Congress, it’s happening again.” In the video, Zinke goes on to falsely claim, as he so often has, that the federal probes cleared him of any wrongdoing and that “you won’t read that in the fake news.” In a February report, Interior’s internal watchdog concluded that Zinke violated ethics rules and misused his office with his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and that he lied to investigators about it. Zinke’s campaign dismissed the report as a “political hit job” by the Biden administration, despite the fact that it was issued by Mark Greenblatt, the Trump-nominated inspector general of the agency. I’ve been shot at before. Doesn’t matter if it’s a terrorist or the deep state. I don’t back down. pic.twitter.com/Sl1LMfBf6y Some of his scandals have been more anodyne. At Interior, he revived an obscure military tradition, insisting that a special flag fly above the agency’s headquarters each time he walked through the door — a practice that his team comically claimed was “a major sign of transparency.” And despite his perceived image as an avid hunter and angler, Zinke showed up to a 2017 outing with Outside magazine correspondent and Montana resident Elliot Woods with his fly reel rigged backward. More recently, Zinke has come under fire for his ties to California. Politico reported last month that his wife had designated a home she inherited in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence — a revelation that became immediate fuel for one of his main Republican primary opponents, former state Sen. Al Olszewski. For all his talk of draining the swamp, Zinke has become a face of Trump-era corruption — someone who was plagued by scandal, prioritized the interests of powerful industries and ultimately made a small fortune working for those same special interests immediately after leaving office. And for all his lamenting about division and anger being “the greatest threat facing America,” Zinke is running an increasingly divisive campaign. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency. He’s worked to drum up fear that the Biden administration threatens to destroy the country and Montanans’ way of life. “In naval terminology, it’s heading to Davy Jones’s locker,” he told Breitbart in January. He’s accused Democrats in Washington of “smoking crack” and posted a picture of him branding a calf with the words “Let’s Go Branding,” a cowboy twist on the popular conservative phrase meaning “Fuck Joe Biden.” And he’s dismissed Americans who got vaccinated against COVID-19 as “little communists.” Whereas promises of fresh fruit and invoking Roosevelt proved to be winning tactics for Zinke in the past, today he’s betting that talk of so-called “energy dominance,” sidling up to a former president who tried to overthrow democracy, and attacking the press and anyone who doesn’t share his views will be enough to stamp his ticket back to Washington. He may very well be right. Whitney Tawney, executive director of Montana Conservation Voters, the environmental group that endorsed Zinke back in 2008, said watching Zinke’s rise to power has been “disappointing” and “disheartening.” Once someone Montanans could count on to walk the walk on conservation, he has, over time, “turned his back on” voters and prioritized lining his own pockets, she said. Tawney compared Zinke to the so-called “Copper Kings,” a trio of rival industrialists that ruled Butte, Montana in the late 1800s. “Unfortunately, he sort of forgot who his real bosses were,” Tawney said.
