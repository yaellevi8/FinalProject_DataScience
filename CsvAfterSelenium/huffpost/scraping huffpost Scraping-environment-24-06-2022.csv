0,Paddleboard Duo Rescues Swimmer Attacked By Great White Shark Off California Beach,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Two paddleboarders and a surfer came to the rescue of a swimmer at a Central Coast beach in California after hearing his panicked cries for help while he was being attacked by a great white shark. The swimmer noted in a statement later that he was incredibly lucky that people rushed to his aid. “He was screaming for help. You could tell by the sound and the emotion in his voice that there was something definitely wrong, and he was slapping the water,” Paul Bandy told KSBW-TV in Monterey. Bandy, a police officer, was paddleboarding with his wife, who’s a nurse, when they heard the swimmer’s screams Wednesday at the popular Lovers Point Beach in Pacific Grove, just south of Monterey. They were in town on vacation celebrating their wedding anniversary. The swimmer, Steven Bruemmer, 62, a member of a swim club that often uses the beach, had bites to his leg and torso. Bandy and others pulled him to shore and applied first aid before he was rushed to Natividad Medical Center in Salinas. “The shark bite was unlucky. But after that, I ... had so much good luck,” Bruemmer said in a statement Thursday to KION-TV in Monterey. “The day was so calm and warm, and the beach was crowded. There were no waves, and there was no chop. So people could hear me yelling ‘Help’ from a great distance,” he added. Bandy and his wife “knew what to do” when they came to his aid, Bruemmer said. A surfer teaching a safety class on shore also jumped into the water with his board and brought an extra one with him to help bring in Bruemmer. “Several bystanders, including a doctor and a nurse who were on the beach for the day, helped put tourniquets on me and get me to the ambulance,” he said. “I remember ... lying in the ambulance, and I thought, ‘My lungs are good. I can breathe.’ ... It seemed really lucky that the shark got me in a spot that seemed survivable,” Bruemmer added. Despite major injuries to his leg and stomach, he is expected to recover. Doctors operated on him for two hours. DNA tests confirmed he was attacked by a great white shark, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Doctors credited the good Samaritans with saving his life. Dr. Nicholas Rottler told KION that Bruemmer was lucky no bones were broken, no organs were damaged and no major arteries were severed. There’s a distinct U-ring shark bite mark around his pelvis, Rottler told KION. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Devastating Earthquake Strikes Afghanistan As Taliban Struggles To Respond,environment," Afghan Fellow, HuffPost Hundreds were killed in an earthquake in the southeastern region of Afghanistan early Wednesday, adding to the country’s already-grave economic and humanitarian crisis. Search and rescue operations are underway. The 5.9-magnitude earthquake caused the most damage in the mountainous areas of Khost and Paktika provinces, which are located in Afghanistan’s southeast and border Pakistan. Afghan media showed images of collapsed buildings and victims wrapped in blankets on the ground in the hours following the quake. Accurate information from the remote mountain villages affected by the quake has been limited. Around 770 people are estimated to have been killed, at least 1,455 people have been injured, and nearly 1,500 homes have now been verified as destroyed and damaged, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. The Taliban has estimated the death toll at more than 1,000 people. On Wednesday evening, the Taliban’s Ministry of Defense confirmed that 90% of earthquake-related search and rescue operations had been finalized. However, additional assessments are taking place Thursday to verify this, and casualties may rise further, OCHA reported. The Taliban’s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada — who almost never appears in public — pleaded with the international community and humanitarian organizations “to help the Afghan people affected by this great tragedy and to spare no effort.” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said the global agency had “fully mobilized” to help, with the U.N. confirming that it had deployed health teams and supplies of medicine, food, trauma kits and emergency shelter to the quake zone. President Joe Biden is monitoring the developments in Afghanistan and has directed the U.S. Agency for International Development and other federal government partners to evaluate how to help those most affected, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement on Thursday. But until that happens, international aid is limited, given the severe sanctions placed on the Taliban government last year after the U.S.-backed Afghan government fell. Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that the Turkish Red Crescent, which operates in Afghanistan, had sent humanitarian aid for the victims. On Thursday, a Taliban spokesperson said aid had also arrived from Qatar, Iran and Pakistan, with flights and trucks carrying items including medicine, tents and tarpaulins. Humanitarian partners are continuing to assist affected families in Paktika and Khost provinces in coordination with the de facto authorities, OCHA reported. Taliban officials have dispatched five helicopters and more than 45 ambulances to Paktika province to facilitate medical evacuations, according to OCHA. Taliban leadership has allocated 100 million afghanis (around 1.1 million U.S. dollars) for relief. Reuters reported that poor telecommunications networks and a lack of proper roads are hampering relief efforts. “We can’t reach the area, the networks are too weak, we [are] trying to get updates,” Mohammad Ismail Muawiyah, a spokesperson for the top Taliban military commander in Paktika province, told Reuters. Poor weather conditions are also hampering transportation, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, or IFRC. “We face risks that are far more serious than war.” Mobile teams have already reached all earthquake-affected locations, reported Dr. Ramiz Alakbarov, U.N. deputy special representative in Afghanistan. “Of course, as the U.N. we do not have … specific equipment to take people from under the rubble. This has to rely mostly on the efforts of the de facto authorities, which also have certain limitations in that respect,” he said. “We are concerned about not just non-food items and getting people into shelters and providing medical supplies, but also preventing water-borne diseases,” Alakbarov said, adding “and that could be a very, very unwelcome scenario.” An estimated $15 million in aid is needed to respond to the disaster, Alakbarov said ― a figure that will likely keep rising as information trickles in about the situation on the ground. “Disaster response is complex and challenging,” said ex-Afghan State Minister for Disaster Management Najib Aqa Fahim, who expressed doubts in an interview with HuffPost about the Taliban’s ability to respond. “The Taliban administration lacks experience in responding to disasters. There was an insufficient response to the seriousness of the occurrence.” Fahim said Afghanistan’s disaster response infrastructure was harmed when the Taliban took over. Unskilled Taliban members have replaced disaster management professionals at the ministry and provincial levels. The High Commission for Disaster Management, which previously served to coordinate between government agencies and international humanitarian organizations, is currently ineffective. There are no longer any provincial or district disaster management committees or local councils to aid in the coordination and dissemination of information. “There is not proper coordination, division of tasks, and clear procedures for responding to such incidents in a timely manner,” Fahim said. This earthquake has only added to the many issues that have been affecting Afghanistan. The economy was already struggling due to armed conflict and severe drought, and the U.S. and its allies had frozen about $7 billion in foreign reserves and cut off international funding when the Taliban took power. “The country is reeling from the effects of decades of conflict, protracted severe drought, the effects of other intense climate-related disasters, extreme economic hardship, a battered health system, and system-wide gaps,” said the IFRC on Wednesday, calling for more global support. “Hence, even though the disaster is localized, the scale of humanitarian needs will be massive.” “Warehouses and stocks are empty. The available funds are meager,” Fahim said. Fahim says that although some funds have been allocated for relief efforts, it takes a long time for them to be used because of a lack of coordination within the Taliban leadership. “My guess is that greater damage and suffering will result from this weakness if international relief organizations do not step in immediately to fill this gap,” Fahim said. Afghanistan is a country with a high risk of being affected by any natural disaster, as it has already been hit by drought and flooding. “We face risks that are far more serious than war,” Fahim said. “We now face the additional difficulty of dealing with natural disasters. These concerns require an understanding by the current administration. We need leadership, strategy, expertise, and funding.” Afghan Fellow, HuffPost"
2,NY Man And Woman Face $500 Fines After Bringing Raccoon To Store,environment," ATTICA, N.Y. (AP) — A New York man and woman face fines of $500 each after they took a raccoon to a pet store to shop for food and a store worker ratted them out, authorities said. A state Department of Environmental Conservation police officer got an urgent call from the Erie County Department of Health about a potentially rabid raccoon on June 2, the DEC said in a news release. The health department said a couple had brought a raccoon to a pet store for food and supplies and a store employee contacted authorities. Raccoons are considered dangerous wild animals because they are known to carry and transmit the deadly rabies virus. The DEC officer used store surveillance video, a store-issued rewards card and license plate information to locate the couple in the town of Attica in western New York, the department said. The owners turned the raccoon over and were each charged with unlawfully possessing a wild animal, which is subject to $500 fine, authorities said. The raccoon that was confiscated from the couple was euthanized and tested for rabies — a test that can only be performed on an animal after it has died. The test was negative, the DEC said."
3,"At Least 1,000 Killed After Powerful Earthquake Hits Eastern Afghanistan",environment," KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A powerful earthquake struck a rural, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday, killing 1,000 people and injuring 1,500 more in one of the deadliest temblors in decades, the state-run news agency reported. Officials warned that the already grim toll may still rise. Information remained scarce on the magnitude 6.1 temblor near the Pakistani border, but quakes of that strength can cause severe damage in an area where homes and other buildings are poorly constructed and landslides are common. Experts put the depth at just 10 kilometers (6 miles) — another factor that could lead to severe destruction. The disaster posed a major test for the Taliban-led government, which seized power last year as the U.S. planned to pull out from the country and end its longest war, two decades after toppling the same insurgents in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Rescuers rushed to the area by helicopter Wednesday, but the response is likely to be complicated since many international aid agencies left Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. Neighboring Pakistan’s Meteorological Department said the quake’s epicenter was in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of the city of Khost. Buildings were also damaged in Khost province, and tremors were felt as far away as the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Footage from Paktika showed men carrying people in blankets to waiting helicopters. Others were treated on the ground. One resident could be seen receiving IV fluids while sitting in a plastic chair outside the rubble of his home and still more were sprawled on gurneys. Some images showed residents picking through clay bricks and other rubble from destroyed stone houses, some of whose roofs or walls had caved in. The death toll, given by Afghan emergency official Sharafuddin Muslim, made it the deadliest quake since 2002, when a 6.1 magnitude temblor killed about 1,000 people in northern Afghanistan immediately after the U.S.-led invasion overthrew the Taliban government. Muslim said 600 more people were injured. In most places in the world, an earthquake of this magnitude wouldn’t inflict such extensive devastation, said Robert Sanders, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. But a quake’s death toll more often comes down to geography, building quality and population density. “Because of the mountainous area, there are rockslides and landslides that we won’t know about until later reporting. Older buildings are likely to crumble and fail,” he said. “Due to how condensed the area is in that part of the world, we’ve seen in the past similar earthquakes deal significant damage.” The Taliban are still trying to reconstitute government ministries abandoned by staff loyal to its previous Western-backed government, and it was not clear how officials arrived at the casualty tolls reported by Bakhtar. In Kabul, Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund convened an emergency meeting at the presidential palace to coordinate the relief effort, and Bilal Karimi, a deputy spokesman for the Taliban government, wrote on Twitter to urge aid agencies to send teams to the area. The “response is on its way,” the U.N. resident coordinator in Afghanistan, Ramiz Alakbarov, wrote on Twitter. That may prove difficult given the situation Afghanistan finds itself in today. After the Taliban swept across the country in 2021, the U.S. military and its allies fell back to Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport and later withdrew completely. Many international humanitarian organizations followed suit because of concerns about security and the Taliban’s poor human rights record. In the time since, the Taliban has worked with Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates on restarting airport operations in Kabul and across the country — but nearly all international carriers still avoid the country, and reluctance on the part of aid organizations to put any money in the Taliban’s coffers could make it difficult to fly in supplies and equipment. The Afghan Red Crescent Society, however, sent some 4,000 blankets, 800 tents and 800 kitchen kits to the affected area, according to Bakhtar’s director-general, Abdul Wahid Rayan. The Italian medical aid group Emergency, which still operates in Afghanistan, said it sent seven ambulances and staff to the areas closest to the quake zone. “The fear is that the victims will increase further, also because many people could be trapped under collapsed buildings,” said Stefano Sozza, country director for Emergency in Afghanistan. “This latest tragedy cannot but worsen further the condition of fragility and economic and social difficulties which Afghanistan has experienced for months.” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said his nation would provide help. At the Vatican, Pope Francis offered prayers for all those killed and injured and for the “suffering of the dear Afghan population.” Some remote areas of Pakistan saw reports of damage to homes near the Afghan border, but it wasn’t immediately clear if that was due to rain or the earthquake, said Taimoor Khan, a disaster management spokesperson in the area. The European seismological agency, EMSC, said the earthquake’s tremors were felt over 500 kilometers (310 miles) by 119 million people across Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Mountainous Afghanistan and the larger region of South Asia along the Hindu Kush mountains has long been vulnerable to devastating earthquakes. ___ Associated Press writers Rahim Faiez and Munir Ahmed in Islamabad and Jon Gambrell and Isabel DeBre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Biden Trades Sharp Words With Chevron Chief Over High Gas Prices,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — In a pointed back and forth, the head of Chevron complained Tuesday that President Joe Biden has vilified energy firms at a time when gasoline prices are at near record levels and the president responded that the oil company CEO was being “mildly sensitive.” The president in recent weeks has criticized oil producers and refiners for maximizing profits and making “more money than God,” rather than increasing production in response to higher prices as the economy recovers from the pandemic and feels the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Michael Wirth, chairman and CEO of Chevron, sent Biden a letter via email on Tuesday that said the president’s own words have been self-defeating in terms of encouraging companies to boost their output. Chevron is investing in more production, Wirth wrote, but “your Administration has largely sought to criticize, and at times vilify, our industry. These actions are not beneficial to meeting the challenges we face and are not what the American people deserve.” The oil company CEO said he wanted a more cooperative relationship with the government. “Let’s work together,” Wirth wrote. “The American people rightly expect our country’s leaders and industry to address the challenges they are facing in a serious and resolute manner.” Asked about those comments, Biden displayed no sympathy. “He’s mildly sensitive,” Biden said. “I didn’t know they’d get their feelings hurt that quickly. Look, we need more refining capacity. This idea that they don’t have oil to drill and to bring up is simply not true.” Average gas prices are nearly $5 a gallon nationwide, a strain on commuters and a political albatross for Biden’s fellow Democrats going into the midterm elections. That has left the White House scrambling for solutions, including a possible suspension of the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax .Biden plans to decide by the end of the week if the tax should be suspended, a move meant to relieve price pressures and that would need approval from a reluctant Congress. The gas tax funds highways, but Biden said Tuesday any lost revenue would not have a major impact on road construction because of last year’s $1 trillion infrastructure law. The clash between the Biden administration and oil producers and refiners unfolded ahead of a Thursday meeting that Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will hold with energy companies. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have previously voiced skepticism about the benefits of suspending the gas tax. But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is sponsoring a bill that would put the gas tax on hold through the end of 2023. Schiff said in a statement that he has been in touch with the White House to encourage the gas tax holiday, adding, “But we shouldn’t stop there. We should also hold Big Oil accountable for the price-gouging that is driving prices up in the first place.” The House has approved legislation to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies, but the bill has stalled in the Senate. Democratic proposals to impose a “windfall profits” tax on oil producers have generated little support in Congress. The possibility of a gas tax holiday has drawn criticism from economists and the business community for not fixing the underlying supply challenges. In an address Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York, a non-profit, non-partisan business group, Target CEO Brian Cornell called the gas tax holiday a temporary “mini stimulus” that does nothing to fundamentally change the supply and demand curve for fuel and transportation. “We have a classic supply-and-demand challenge,” Cornell told the audience. ”In all due respect, the gas holiday is only going to fuel demand. It’s doing nothing to increase the supply.” Harvard University professor Jason Furman, formerly the top economist in the Obama White House, said a gas tax suspension would not address the supply pressures. “Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic,” he wrote on Twitter. “Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry ― with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the administration is looking into as many ways as possible to provide consumers with some relief at the gas pump. But the administration does not plan to tell Americans to drive less during the July 4 holiday and reduce some of the supply pressures. “Americans are going to do what they feel is right for themselves and for their family,” Jean-Pierre said. “That’s not something for us to make a judgment on.” ___ AP reporters Matthew Daly in Washington and Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

11,Cougar Killed By Vehicle On Same Road Where Her Mom Was Also Killed,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A California mountain lion being tracked by biologists met a violent end last week on the very same road where her mother was killed four years ago. A vehicle struck and killed the radio-collared female cougar known as P-54 on Las Virgenes Road in the Santa Monica Mountains on Friday, the National Park Service said on social media. A post shared by Santa Monica Mountains (@santamonicamountainsnps) The announcement noted that P-54 was the 29th mountain lion since 2002 to be killed by a vehicle in the scientists’ study area, which includes the Santa Monica Mountains, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, and Griffith Park. Ten of the cougars killed have had radio collars. But P-54’s death was especially poignant in light of the death of her mother, P-23, in 2018. P-23 was struck and killed by a vehicle in January of that year “not too far” from where P-54 died. After her death, animal advocates said the incident illustrated the need for more wildlife crossings over California’s busy highways. “These big cats are no match for the network of roads, highways, and sprawl that we’ve built with little regard for their impacts on lions or wildlife connectivity,” Center for Biological Diversity attorney J.P. Rose told HuffPost at the time. P-54 and her sibling were about a year old when their mother was killed, around the early side of the period in which mountain lion kittens typically leave their moms and set out on their own. Though scientists were at first unsure how the kittens would fare, P-54 grew up and ultimately became a mother herself. However, her first litter of three is believed to have not survived past early kittenhood, and the two cubs in her second litter also met untimely deaths. One of them, known as P-98, was killed by wildlife wardens after attacking a child in the yard of a Los Angeles County home. And two months ago, her other cub, P-97, was killed in the same manner as his mother and grandmother, though not on the same road, according to the National Park Service. A vehicle fatally struck him on a freeway near Los Angeles’ Getty Center. He was 18 months old. Assignment editor, HuffPost"

13,Dog Seen Running From Gorilla At San Diego Zoo Safely Reunited With Owner,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A California dog’s totally bananas adventure has come to a happy ending. The dog, whose brief but scary stint cavorting inside the San Diego Zoo’s gorilla enclosure made national headlines, has been reunited with his owner, the San Diego Humane Society said in a statement sent to HuffPost. Previously nicknamed “Mighty Joe Young” as a nod to his great ape encounter, the mischievous canine’s real name is Meatball. Last week, visitors and zookeepers at the San Diego Zoo were shocked to see that the loose dog had made his way into the gorilla enclosure. Video from onlookers even showed one of the gorillas chasing the dog around in a moment some feared could turn ugly. Fortunately, staff members at the zoo were able to keep the gorilla away as San Diego Humane Society workers retrieved the dog. The animal shelter had planned to put him up for adoption if his family could not be found, but Meatball’s owner came forward and reclaimed him over the weekend. The organization said they “we’re so happy to see him return home!” and noted that he was cleared by veterinarians and neutered heading out of the shelter. The ordeal has also prompted some increased security for Meatball. “Meatball’s family was able to fit their yard with a trolley system so he’s able to run and explore without the risk of wandering from home again in the future,” the statement said.

14,The World's Largest Freshwater Fish Is Caught In Cambodia,environment," The world’s largest recorded freshwater fish, a giant stingray, has been caught in the Mekong River in Cambodia, according to scientists from the Southeast Asian nation and the United States. (See images below.) The stingray, captured on June 13, measured almost four meters (13 feet) from snout to tail and weighed slightly under 300 kilograms (660 pounds), according to a statement Monday by Wonders of the Mekong, a joint Cambodian-U.S. research project. The previous record for a freshwater fish was a 293-kilogram (646-pound) Mekong giant catfish, discovered in Thailand in 2005, the group said. The stingray was snagged by a local fisherman south of Stung Treng in northeastern Cambodia. The stingray was snagged by a local fisherman south of Stung Treng in northeastern Cambodia. The fisherman, who earned $600 for the catch, alerted a nearby team of scientists from the Wonders of the Mekong project, which has publicized its conservation work in communities along the river. “When you see a fish this size, especially in freshwater, it is hard to comprehend, so I think all of our team was stunned,” Wonders of the Mekong leader Zeb Hogan said in an online interview from the University of Nevada in Reno. The university is partnering with the Cambodian Fisheries Administration and USAID, the U.S. government’s international development agency. Freshwater fish are defined as those that spend their entire lives in freshwater, as opposed to giant marine species such as bluefin tuna and marlin, or fish that migrate between fresh and saltwater like the huge beluga sturgeon. The team that rushed to the site inserted a tagging device near the tail of the mighty fish before releasing it. The device will send tracking information for the next year, providing unprecedented data on giant stingray behavior in Cambodia. “The fact that the fish can still get this big is a hopeful sign for the Mekong River, ” Hogan said, noting that the waterway faces many environmental challenges."
15,"Yellowstone Flooding Rebuild Could Take Years, Cost Billions Of Dollars",environment," Created in 1872 as the United States was recovering from the Civil War, Yellowstone was the first of the national parks that came to be referred to as America’s best idea. Now, the home to gushing geysers, thundering waterfalls and some of the country’s most plentiful and diverse wildlife is facing its biggest challenge in decades. Floodwaters this week wiped out numerous bridges, washed out miles of roads and closed the park as it approached peak tourist season during its 150th anniversary celebration. Nearby communities were swamped and hundreds of homes flooded as the Yellowstone River and its tributaries raged. The scope of the damage is still being tallied by Yellowstone officials, but based on other national park disasters, it could take years and cost upwards of $1 billion to rebuild in an environmentally sensitive landscape where construction season only runs from the spring thaw until the first snowfall. Based on what park officials have revealed and Associated Press images and video taken from a helicopter, the greatest damage seemed to be to roads, particularly on the highway connecting the park’s north entrance in Gardiner, Montana, to the park’s offices in Mammoth Hot Springs. Large sections of the road were undercut and washed away as the Gardner River jumped its banks. Perhaps hundreds of footbridges on trails may have been damaged or destroyed. “This is not going to be an easy rebuild,” Superintendent Cam Sholly said early in the week as he highlighted photos of massive gaps of roadway in the steep canyon. “I don’t think it’s going to be smart to invest potentially, you know, tens of millions of dollars, or however much it is, into repairing a road that may be subject to seeing a similar flooding event in the future.” Re-establishing a human imprint in a national park is always a delicate operation, especially as a changing climate makes natural disasters more likely. Increasingly intense wildfires are occurring, including one last year that destroyed bridges, cabins and other infrastructure in Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California. Flooding has already done extensive damage in other parks and is a threat to virtually all the more-than 400 national parks, a report by The Rocky Mountain Climate Organization found in 2009. Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state closed for six months after the worst flooding in its history in 2006. Damage to roads, trails, campgrounds and buildings was estimated at $36 million. Yosemite Valley in California’s Yosemite National Park has flooded several times, but suffered its worst damage 25 years ago when heavy downpours on top of a large snowpack — a scenario similar to the Yellowstone flood — submerged campgrounds, flooded hotel rooms, washed out bridges and sections of road, and knocked out power and sewer lines. The park was closed for more than two months. Congress allocated $178 million in emergency funds – a massive sum for park infrastructure at the time – and additional funding eventually surpassed $250 million, according to a 2013 report. But the rebuilding effort once estimated to last four to five years dragged out for 15, due in part to environmental lawsuits over a protected river corridor and a long bureaucratic planning and review process. It’s not clear if Yellowstone would face the same obstacles, though reconstructing the road that runs near Mammoth Hot Springs, where steaming water bubbles up over an otherworldly series of stone terraces, presents a challenge. It’s created by a unique natural formation of underground tubes and vents that push the hot water to the surface, and would be just one of many natural wonders crews would have to be careful not to disturb, said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Along with the formation itself, there are also microbes and insects that thrive in the environment found almost nowhere else. And the park will need to avoid damaging any archaeological or cultural artifacts in the area with a rich Native American history. “They’ll have to look at all the resources the park is designed to protect, and try to do this project as carefully as possible, but they’re also going to try to go fairly quickly,” Hartl said. Having to reroute the roadway that hugged the Gardner River could be an opportunity to better protect the waterway and the fish and other species that thrive there from oil and other microscopic pollution that comes from passing vehicles, Hartl said. “The river will be healthier for it,” he said. The Yosemite flood was seen by the park as an opportunity to rethink its planning and not necessarily rebuild in the same places, said Frank Dean, president and chief executive of the Yosemite Conservancy and a former park ranger. Some facilities were relocated outside the flood plain and some campgrounds that had been submerged in the flood were never restored. At Yosemite Lodge, cabins that had been slated for removal in the 1980s were swamped and had to be removed. “The flood took them all out like a precision strike,” Dean said. “I’m not going to say it’s a good thing, but providence came in and made the decision for them.” Yellowstone’s recovery comes as a rapidly growing number of people line up to visit the country’s national parks, even as a backlog of deferred maintenance budget grows into tens of billions of dollars. The park was already due for funding from the Great American Outdoors Act, a 2020 law passed by Congress that authorizes nearly $3 billion for maintenance and other projects on public lands. Now it will need another infusion of money for more pressing repairs that Emily Douce, director of operations and park funding at National Parks Conservation Association, estimated could hit at least $1 billion. The southern half of the park is expected to reopen next week, allowing visitors to flock to Old Faithful, the rainbow colored Grand Prismatic Spring, and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and its majestic waterfall. But the flood-damaged northern end may not reopen this year, depriving visitors from seeing Tower Fall and Lamar Valley, one of the best places in the world to see wolves and grizzly bears. Some days during the high season, an animal sighting can lead to thousands of people parked on the side of the road hoping to catch a glimpse. Whether some of these areas are reopened will depend on how quickly washed-out roads can be repaired, downed trees can be removed and mudslides cleared. Maintaining the approximately 466 miles (750 kilometers) of roadway throughout the park is a major job. Much of the roadway originally was designed for stagecoaches, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice-president of public affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Part of the effort of the last couple of decades has been to stabilize the road to make it safe for heavier vehicles to travel on it,” she said. Located at a high elevation where snow and cold weather is not uncommon eight months of the year and there are many tiny earthquakes, road surfaces don’t last as long and road crews have a short window to complete projects. One recently completed road job created closures for about two years. “I think it’ll probably be several years before the park is totally back to normal,” Hartl said."

0,Montana Gov. Spent Days Vacationing In Italy As His State Suffered Historic Flooding,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte was nowhere to be found this week, as his state was devastated by historic flooding. The flooding, triggered by torrential rain and rapid snowmelt, devastated communities across southwest Montana. Swollen rivers washed away bridges, buildings and entire roads in and around Yellowstone National Park, stranded tourists and polluted drinking water in many communities. The National Park Service shuttered all of Yellowstone, and northern areas of the park are expected to remain closed for months — dealing what is likely to be a devastating blow to the economies of gateway communities like Gardiner, which were hard-hit during the early part of the pandemic when tourism ground to a halt. But for days, Gianforte’s office refused to disclose the governor’s whereabouts, citing “security reasons.” It acknowledged in statements to local reporters that he’d left the country last week, before the floods, on a “long-scheduled personal trip with the first lady,” and said he was returning home “early and as quickly as possible.” Around the state capitol in Helena, rumors swirled that the governor was in Africa, likely on safari, according to a Twitter post from Max Croes, a longtime Democratic campaign manager and staffer based in Helena. Maritsa Georgiou, a correspondent for Newsy based in Missoula, ultimately discovered that the governor and his wife were vacationing in Tuscany, the ritzy region of central Italy. Newsy obtained a photo from an anonymous source that showed the couple dining at a restaurant in the village Casole d’Elsa. The picture was reportedly taken 12 minutes after Gianforte’s office sent out its statement about the governor returning to Montana “as quickly as possible.” Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office says he will be back in Montana tonight. They say they do not share his location when he's out of the country for security reasons. @Newsy has obtained a time stamped photo that shows he's been in the Tuscany region of Italy. #mtnews #mtpol The incident quickly earned Gianforte comparisons to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who famously fled to Cancun, Mexico, last year as his state was reeling from winter storms and widespread power outages. Gianforte’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Friday morning. But in a statement to local press, it finally confirmed his whereabouts. “With the governor back in the state and security concerns no longer an issue, we are providing information as promised,” Brooke Stroyke, a spokeswoman for the governor, wrote. “The governor departed early Saturday morning to Italy with his wife for a long-planned personal, private trip.” His office has never detailed what “security concerns” were at play, or why it took several days for him to return. Stroyke noted Gianforte had delegated his authority to Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras, who signed a statewide emergency declaration in the governor’s absence. She said the two “worked closely over the last four days to take swift, decisive action.” Gianforte is scheduled to visit Gardiner, located at the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park, on Friday to survey damage, according to his office. Gov. Gianforte was in Italy, his office confirms Friday morning. The governor left Saturday for a personal trip to Italy and returned last night. He will be in Gardiner today for a tour and briefing. #mtnews #mtpol #MTFloods #YellowstoneFloods pic.twitter.com/4PUXF0atfx While Gianforte was in Italy, Montana National Guard soldiers were rescuing dozens of his constituents from floodwaters. A team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, was on the ground assessing flood damage. And President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for the state. When Cruz escaped winter storm-ravaged Texas for sunny Mexico last year, conservatives flocked to his defense with absurd justifications, including that he would have had nothing to offer Texans and was “not using up valuable resources of energy, food and water.” Montana Republicans have similarly come to Gianforte’s defense. “Regardless of where he was, he was communicating with the people on the ground to make sure that the issues were being addressed,” Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) told Fox News. Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,"Thousands Of Cattle Killed By Brutal Heat, Humidity In Kansas",environment," BELLE PLAINE, Kan. (AP) — Thousands of cattle in feedlots in southwestern Kansas have died of heat stress due to soaring temperatures, high humidity and little wind in recent days, industry officials said. The final toll remains unclear, but as of Thursday at least 2,000 heat-related deaths had been reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the state agency that assists in disposing of carcasses. Agency spokesman Matt Lara said he expects that number to rise as more feedlots report losses from this week’s heat wave. The cattle deaths have sparked unsubstantiated reports on social media and elsewhere that something besides the weather is at play, but Kansas agriculture officials said there’s no indication of any other cause. “This was a true weather event — it was isolated to a specific region in southwestern Kansas,” said A.J. Tarpoff, a cattle veterinarian with Kansas State University. “Yes, temperatures rose, but the more important reason why it was injurious was that we had a huge spike in humidity ... and at the same time wind speeds actually dropped substantially, which is rare for western Kansas.” Last week, temperatures were in the 70s and 80s, but on Saturday they spiked higher than 100 degrees, said Scarlett Hagins, spokeswoman for the Kansas Livestock Association. “And it was that sudden change that didn’t allow the cattle to acclimate that caused the heat stress issues in them,” she said. The deaths represent a huge economic loss because the animals, which typically weigh around 1,500 pounds, are worth around $2,000 per head, Hagins said. Federal disaster programs will help some producers who incurred a loss, she added. And the worst may be over. Nighttime temperatures have been cooler and — as long as there is a breeze — the animals are able to recover, Tarpoff said. Hagins said heat-related deaths in the industry are rare because ranchers take precautions such as providing extra drinking water, altering feeding schedules so animals are not digesting during the heat of the day, and using sprinkler systems to cool them down. “Heat stress is always a concern this time of year for cattle and so they have mitigation protocols put in place to be prepared for this kind of thing,” she said. Many cattle had still not shed their winter coats when the heatwave struck. “This is a one in 10-year, 20-year type event. This is not a normal event,” said Brandon Depenbusch, operator of the Innovative Livestock Services feedlot in Great Bend, Kansas. “It is extremely abnormal, but it does happen.” While his feedlot had “zero problems,” he noted that his part of the state did not have the same combination of high temperatures, high humidity, low winds and no cloud cover that hit southwestern Kansas. Elsewhere, cattle ranchers haven’t been so hard hit. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Nebraska Cattlemen said they have received no reports of higher-than-normal cattle deaths in the state, despite a heat index of well over 100 degrees this week. Oklahoma City National Stockyards President Kelli Payne said no cattle deaths have been reported since temperatures topped 90 degrees last Saturday, after rising from the mid 70s starting June 1. “We have water and sprinklers here to help mitigate heat and the heat wave,” Payne said, but “we don’t have any control over that pesky Mother Nature.”"
2,Photos Show The Aftermath Of Yellowstone's Historic Flooding,environment," Associate Reporter, HuffPost Yellowstone National Park, which spreads across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, will remain closed for a substantial period of time after Monday’s record-breaking floodwaters ripped through the historic park. Heavy rains, along with melting snow from the mountains, caused a rush of water through the area, forcing officials to close all entrances to the park amid its busiest season for tourists. Multiple roads, including the North Entrance in Gardiner, Montana; Mammoth Hot Springs; Lamar Valley; and Cooke City, Montana, sustained extensive damage, according to a press release from the park. Despite the devastation, the heavy rain and flooding did not injure any residents or tourists. Here are some of the aftermath photos from the Yellowstone National Park floods.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,UPS Test Drives Tiny Battery-Powered Cycles For Deliveries In Congested Cities,environment," NEW YORK (AP) — The sleek four-wheeled carts look familiar enough, but not even UPS knows precisely how to describe what could be the delivery giant’s latest way to get packages to your door. UPS unveiled Tuesday a battery-powered, four-wheeled cycle to more efficiently haul cargo in some of the world’s most congested streets and to reduce its carbon footprint. The company is trying to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The slimmed-down vehicles don the company’s gold-colored logo and accompanying stripe on a dark brown background. But the “eQuad” — as the company calls it — garnered amusement from passersby. Ian Lagowitz had never seen one and walked over to give it a look. “It’s funny looking,” he said, “but it’s probably good for the city, right?” Mohammad Islam called the vehicle “cool stuff,” and wished the program well. “Big trucks always blocking the traffic,” he said, “so if they do that kind of stuff, it’s 10 times better for everybody.” The pedal-powered vehicle was dwarfed by one of the company’s more traditional delivery trucks, which rumble through traffic and sometimes draw the ire of motorists trying to get by parked trucks on narrow streets. Delivery companies have tried all sorts of ways to deliver packages — from traditional vans to drones. The company now has a fleet of more than 1,000 electric vehicles and thousands more that aren’t powered by traditional gas engines. UPS said a trial run is focused on New York City and in several cities in Europe. “New York is a complicated city, when we look at the density,” said Nicole Pilet, the industrial engineering director for UPS. “So if we can have success here in the city, then we can see how we implement in other cities throughout the U.S.” The company had its start in Seattle more than a century ago and the first deliveries were made by foot or bicycle. As the company grew, its motorized fleet did, too. “This is right in my wheelhouse,” said Dyghton Anderson, a 22-year-old UPS delivery person and an avid cyclist who is helping pilot the program. “I ride to and from work — from all the way from the Bronx all the way to here on 43rd — so it’s pretty comfortable for me.” ___ Associated Press writer Bobby Caina Calvan contributed to this story."
11,Yellowstone Closed After Historic Floods; Some Areas Cut Off,environment," HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Communities bordering Yellowstone National Park were isolated and tourists stranded Tuesday after record floodwaters knocked out roads and bridges in Montana and Wyoming and forced the closure of all entrances to the park. The flooding followed a torrent of rain that combined with a rapidly melting snowpack and came just as the summer tourist season was ramping up. While numerous homes and other structures were destroyed, there were no immediate reports of injuries. Yellowstone officials said they were assessing damage from the storms, which washed away bridges, caused mudslides and forced evacuations by boat and helicopter. It’s unclear how many visitors are stranded or have been forced to leave the park and how many people who live outside the park have been rescued and evacuated. Some of the worst damage happened in the northern part of the park and Yellowstone’s gateway communities in southern Montana. National Park Service photos of northern Yellowstone showed a mudslide, washed out bridges and roads undercut by churning floodwaters of the Gardner and Lamar rivers. The flooding cut off road access to Gardiner, Montana, a town of about 900 people near the confluence of the Yellowstone and Gardner rivers, just outside Yellowstone’s busy North Entrance. Cooke City was also isolated by floodwaters and evacuations were also issued for residents in Livingston. Officials in Park County, which encompasses those cities, said on Facebook Monday evening that extensive flooding throughout the county had made drinking water unsafe in many areas. Evacuations and rescues were ongoing and officials urged people who were in a safe place to stay put overnight. The Montana National Guard said Monday it sent two helicopters to southern Montana to help with the evacuations. Cory Mottice, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, said rain is not in the immediate forecast, and cooler temperatures will lessen the snowmelt in coming days. “This is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,” Mottice said. Scientists say climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires, although single weather events usually cannot be directly linked to climate change without extensive study. The Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs crested at 13.88 feet (4.2 meters) Monday, higher than the previous record of 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) set in 1918, according the the National Weather Service. At a cabin in Gardiner, Parker Manning got an up-close view of the water rising and the river bank sloughing off in the raging Yellowstone River floodwaters just outside his door. “We started seeing entire trees floating down the river, debris,” Manning, who is from Terra Haute, Indiana, told The Associated Press. “Saw one crazy single kayaker coming down through, which was kind of insane.” On Monday evening, Manning watched as the rushing waters undercut the opposite riverbank, causing a house to fall into the Yellowstone River and float away mostly intact. Floodwaters inundated a street in Red Lodge, a Montana town of 2,100 that’s a popular jumping-off point for a scenic, winding route into the Yellowstone high country. Twenty-five miles (40 kilometers) to the northeast, in Joliet, Kristan Apodaca wiped away tears as she stood across the street from a washed-out bridge, The Billings Gazette reported. The log cabin that belonged to her grandmother, who died in March, flooded, as did the park where Apodaca’s husband proposed. “I am sixth-generation. This is our home,” she said. “That bridge I literally drove yesterday. My mom drove it at 3 a.m. before it was washed out.” On Monday, Yellowstone officials evacuated the northern part of the park, where roads may remain impassable for a substantial length of time, park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. But the flooding affected the rest of the park, too, with park officials warning of yet higher flooding and potential problems with water supplies and wastewater systems at developed areas. Yellowstone got 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) of rain Saturday, Sunday and into Monday. The Beartooth Mountains northeast of Yellowstone got as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters), according to the National Weather Service. In south-central Montana, flooding on the Stillwater River stranded 68 people at a campground. Stillwater County Emergency Services agencies and crews with the Stillwater Mine rescued people Monday from the Woodbine Campground by raft. Some roads in the area are closed because of flooding and residents have been evacuated. “We will be assessing the loss of homes and structures when the waters recede,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. The flooding happened while other parts of the U.S. burned in hot and dry weather. More than 100 million Americans were being warned to stay indoors as a heat wave settles over states stretching through parts of the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes and east to the Carolinas. Elsewhere in the West, crews from California to New Mexico are battling wildfires in hot, dry and windy weather."
12,"Yellowstone Floods Wipe Out Roads, Bridges, Strand Visitors",environment," HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Massive floodwaters ravaged Yellowstone National Park and nearby communities Monday, washing out roads and bridges, cutting off electricity and forcing visitors to evacuate parts of the iconic park at the height of summer tourist season. All entrances to Yellowstone were closed due to the deluge, caused by heavy rains and melting snowpack, while park officials ushered tourists out of the most affected areas. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Some of the worst damage happened in the northern part of the park and Yellowstone’s gateway communities in southern Montana.

But the flooding affected the rest of the park, too, with park officials warning of yet higher flooding and potential problems with water supplies and wastewater systems at developed areas. “We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we’re able to assess the damage throughout the park,” Sholly said in the statement. The park’s gates will be closed at least through Wednesday, officials said. The rains hit right as summer tourist season was ramping up. June, at the onset of an annual wave of over 3 million visitors that doesn’t abate until fall, is one of Yellowstone’s busiest months. Remnants of winter — in the form of snow still melting off and rushing off the mountains — made for an especially bad time to get heavy rain. Yellowstone got 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) of rain Saturday, Sunday and into Monday. The Beartooth Mountains northeast of Yellowstone got as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters), according to the National Weather Service. “It’s a lot of rain, but the flooding wouldn’t have been anything like this if we didn’t have so much snow,” said Cory Mottice, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana. “This is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before.” The rain will likely abate while cooler temperatures lessen snowmelt in coming days, Mottice said.

13,"Western Wildfires Force Evacuations In Arizona, California",environment," FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — The Western U.S. on Monday marked another day of hot, dry and windy weather as crews from California to New Mexico battled wildfires that had forced hundreds of people to leave their homes. Several hundred homes on the outskirts of Flagstaff, Arizona, were evacuated and the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort was closed as a precaution because of a wildfire — the second to hit the area this year. Crews were expecting wind gusts up to 50 mph (80 kph) as they battled the blaze that has burned through parts of the footprint left by another springtime fire that destroyed over two dozen homes. No homes have been lost in the fire reported Sunday that has burned about 8 square miles (20 square kilometers). “It’s literally like déjà vu,” said Coconino County sheriff’s spokesman Jon Paxton. “We are in the same exact spot doing the same exact thing as we were a month and a half ago. People are tired.” Wildfires broke out early this spring in multiple states in the Western U.S., where climate change and an enduring drought are fanning the frequency and intensity of forest and grassland fires. The number of square miles burned so far this year is more than double the 10-year national average, and states like New Mexico already have set records with devastating blazes that destroyed hundreds of homes while causing environmental damage that is expected to affect water supplies. Nationally, more than 6,200 wildland firefighters were battling nearly three dozen uncontained fires that had charred over 1 million acres (4,408 square kilometers), according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Even in Alaska, forecasters have warned that many southwestern fires have grown exceptionally over the last week, which is unusual for that area. Southwest Alaska normally experiences shorter periods of high fire danger because intermittent rain can provide relief, but since mid-May the region has been hot and windy, helping to dry out vegetation. Favorable weather Monday helped slow the progression of a tundra wildfire just over 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) away from an Alaska Native village. Moderate temperatures and a shift in the wind that had been driving the fire toward St. Mary’s will allow firefighters to directly attack the flames and increase protections for the Yup’ik community. The lightning-sparked fire is estimated at about 193 square miles (500 square kilometers). It’s burning dry grass and shrubs in southwest Alaska’s mostly treeless tundra. In California, evacuations were ordered for about 300 remote homes near a wildfire that flared up over the weekend in forest land northeast of Los Angeles near the Pacific Crest Trail in the San Gabriel Mountains. The blaze saw renewed growth Sunday afternoon and by midday Monday had scorched about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square km) of pine trees and dry brush, fire spokesperson Dana Dierkes said. “The fuel is very dry, so it acts like a ladder, carrying flames from the bottom of the trees to the very top,” Dierkes said. Crews were also contending with unpredictable winds that were expected to strengthen later in the day, she said. Aside from mandatory evacuations for some, the remainder of the mountain town of Wrightwood, with about 4,500 residents, was under an evacuation warning. Several roads also were closed. The fire was 18% contained. Five people were rescued from a dangerous area after a wildfire broke out Monday near Dulzura in San Diego County near the Mexican border and spread to nearly 600 acres (242 hectares), authorities said. Two of those rescued were taken to a hospital but there was no immediate word on how they were injured or their conditions, fire officials said. Fire conditions were elevated because of warm and dry weekend weather across Southern California. Monday was expected to be cooler, but another heat wave was expected at midweek, the National Weather Service said. In Northern California, a 50-mile (80-km) stretch of State Route 70 was closed indefinitely on Monday after mud, boulders and dead trees inundated lanes during flash floods along a wildfire burn scar. Several drivers were rescued Sunday evening from debris flowing on the highway when hillsides burned bare by last year’s enormous Dixie Fire came loose. No injuries were reported. The causes of the latest California fires were under investigation. U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officers cited a 57-year-old camper for lighting toilet paper on fire and placing it under a rock Saturday near the origin of the Arizona wildfire. The fire was reported a day later. Court documents show the man told authorities he tried to put the fire out with his sleeping bag, but his attorney said in federal court Monday that doesn’t mean his client was responsible for sparking the blaze. Flagstaff resident Janetta Kathleen rode her horse, Squish, up a hill to get a better look at the wildfire Sunday evening and watched it creep toward homes in the shadow of the mountain. Her home isn’t directly in the fire’s path, but her family, two bulldogs and horses are ready to go at a moment’s notice. “I need to know what’s going on because I have decisions to make for my family,” she said. “If the winds shift, we’ll be in trouble.” Hikers, campers and others who were out enjoying the forest also had to leave Sunday. A shelter was set up at a middle school. Strong winds sent embers across U.S. Route 89, the main route to the turnoff for the Grand Canyon’s east rim entrance, through the Navajo Nation and up into Utah. Many people commute between the reservation and Flagstaff for work. Parts of the highway remained closed Monday. “We’re not working directly on suppressing the fire to get the whole thing out right now,” said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith. “That’s not our focus and it’s not possible right now. Right now, it’s going to be focused on protecting life and property.” Smoke from the fire near Flagstaff caused hazy skies in Colorado on Monday, obscuring views of the Rocky Mountains from Denver and other cities along the state’s Front Range. Meanwhile, firefighters worked to contain a small wildfire burning in juniper and pinion pine that briefly caused evacuation orders Sunday in the San Luis Valley’s Rio Grande National Forest in southern Colorado. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for high fire danger in central and southern parts of Colorado as well as parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Winds are expected to ease after Monday with some moisture moving in later this week in parts of the Southwest, the weather service said. ___ Associated Press writers Christopher Weber in Los Angeles; Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska; Jim Anderson in Denver; and Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, contributed to this report."
14,Hyena Caught In Lion's Grip Makes Death-Defying Escape Attempt,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A screeching hyena appeared headed for death when a lion clamped down on its scavenging rival at Sabi Sands Game Reserve in South Africa. (Watch the video below.) But the determined hyena managed to escape. The scenario, shared by the wildlife platform Latest Sightings on YouTube on June 7, unfolded when two hyenas tried to steal the kill of a leopard and the lion pounced on one of the hyenas, videographer Dean Robinson told the site. The leopard skedaddled up a tree and watched the lion attempt to eliminate the remaining hyena. Lions rarely eat hyenas but they’re down for a kill to decrease competition. This encounter seemed destined for a fatal outcome. But, Robinson said, “Fortunately for the hyena, the lion loosened its grip for a split second and the hyena took its chance, and made a getaway. The leopard was safe in the tree, the hyena ran away and the lion left the scene.” Lions, with the exception of the old and the weak ones, tend to not consume hyenas because they dislike the taste of the animals due to their diet, according to animalfoodplanet.com. The big cats prefer herbivores because the meat of those animals has more fat and nutrients. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Record-Breaking Heat Wave Hits Over 75 Million Americans,environment,"  A record-breaking heat wave scorched states in the Southwest this past weekend as higher temperatures are expected to move east. Over 75 million people were impacted by some sort of heat warning or advisory Sunday as a heat wave swept parts of the country, The New York Times reported. The National Weather Service warned of the heat wave moving into central and eastern states with “normal to record-breaking temperatures” hitting the midwest to North and South Carolina on Tuesday. As temperatures rose above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the Southwest, the heat was effective enough for a TikToker to use his dashboard as an impromptu grill to make burgers on, USA Today reported. California’s Death Valley hit 123 F on Saturday, 11 degrees short of the hottest recorded temperature ever recorded in Death Valley, according to the Times. That record-high temperature was discovered at Death Valley in 1913 although the record’s validity has been questioned by climate experts. Robert Oravec, a lead forecaster at the National Weather Service, described the heat wave as “very typical” as it began in the Southwest and its headed to the Plains. “You’re almost into mid-June now, so it’s not uncommon to see weather patterns that support a heat wave,” he told NPR. The National Weather Service recommends a number of actions people can take to stay safe in a heat wave. Some of these tips include reducing activities when it’s hot out or finding another time for them, drinking “plenty” of water, taking a “cool” shower or bath and checking in on elderly or sick people.

0,"Arizona Residents Flee Wildfire That's Destroyed More Than 4,000 Acres",environment," FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Evacuations are in effect in parts of northern Arizona as a wildfire about 6 miles (9 kilometers) north of Flagstaff steadily grew Sunday, authorities said. Coconino National Forest officials said the Pipeline Fire was reported at 10:15 a.m. by a fire lookout and had burned approximately 4,000-5,000 acres by late Sunday, pushing about 15 miles (24 kilometers). In connection with the fire, Forest Service law enforcement said they have arrested and charged a 57-year-old man with natural resource violations. The cause of the wildfire wasn’t immediately known. Coconino County Sheriff’s officials said the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort and people living in the area of the west Schultz Pass Road must evacuate. People living in Doney Park and the area near Mt. Elden should be prepared. Euelda King and her family evacuated their home for the second time this year because of wildfires. She hadn’t settled back in from a springtime blaze before leaving again Sunday, this time able to grab photographs and clothing she didn’t get earlier. “Here we go again,” she said. The family of 11 is planning to stay at the Navajo Nation casino, which is offering assistance to tribal members who evacuated. The family was waiting in a parking lot ahead of road closure signs, watching smoke billow through the air and aircraft flying overhead. “The winds are high, and I think they’re going to have a little bit of a battle with it,” King said. Wind gusts were sweeping the smoke through Schultz Pass toward Doney Park and authorities said recreationists were being told to leave immediately, especially those in the Schultz Pass area. The American Red Cross Arizona opened a shelter at Sinagua Middle School for residents who evacuated. “With this thing going as fast as it is, it could get much closer, of course hoping it doesn’t,” King said. Authorities said 13 engines, nine crews, six prevention patrol units, three bulldozers and one water tender were involved in the fighting the fire. An Incident Management Team is scheduled to arrive Monday. The Arizona Department of Transportation has closed U.S. Route 89. The department said in a Twitter post that there is no estimated time to reopen the road."
1,Some Canadians Experienced Internet Outages Due To An Unlikely Culprit,environment,"  Canadians had trouble logging in this week because a troublesome beaver wanted to bring a log down, according to an electric company. Officials in northwest British Columbia attributed a service outage on Tuesday to a beaver that had a dam good time ― er, a damn good time ― chewing on a tree, Smithers Interior News reported. Bob Gammer, an official with the electric company B.C. Hydro, said chew marks were found on a tree that fell and brought down lines, affecting a number of his company’s customers and others, according to the outlet. The beaver’s apparent actions resulted in sporadic phone, internet and TV service in the northwest part of the province. “It’s unusual, but it does happen every once in a while,” Gammer said. “I wouldn’t be a rich man if I had a nickel for every beaver outage, but they do happen.” The downed tree led to a fire, and forced a number of local business to become cash-only for a while. There’s no evidence the beaver itself was harmed, according to reports. It wasn’t the first time a beaver has caused this kind of trouble. A beaver “chewed through a fibre cable” in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, in April 2021, affecting internet service for about 900 customers, CBC reported. The phone service company Telus called the beaver’s actions a “bizarre and uniquely Canadian turn of events.” "
2,A Rare Flowering Plant Could Help Save The Southwest's Last Free-Flowing River,environment," A rare plant that depends on wetlands for survival is now on the federal endangered species list, a designation that environmentalists say will boost efforts to protect the last free-flowing river in the desert Southwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published the decision Friday in the federal register to list the Arizona eryngo as endangered and set aside nearly 13 acres (5 hectares) in southern Arizona as critical habitat. The decision comes years after environmentalists petitioned and then sued to gain protection for the plant with cream-colored spherical flower heads. Only two populations are known in Arizona — near Tucson and in the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area. The eryngo grows in ciénegas, a type of wetland fed by natural springs that come from the deep aquifer and nourish the San Pedro River. The plant’s habitat and the flow of the San Pedro River have been threatened by over-pumping of groundwater in the region, climate change and drought. “This gives us a new ability to protect it,” Robin Silver of the Center for Biological Diversity said of the river. “Protecting plants protects the aquifer itself.” The plant also is found in the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora. It historically grew in southwestern New Mexico at Las Playas Springs but hasn’t been documented there since 1851, the Fish and Wildlife Service said. The critical habitat in Arizona lies in Pima and Cochise Counties and doesn’t include another location where efforts have failed to reintroduce the eryngo. The agency said development still can occur in the areas, but anything that relies on federal funding or federal permits has to be analyzed to ensure it doesn’t impact the eryngo’s habitat. “Partnerships will be central to addressing the threats to the Arizona eryngo and putting it on the path to recovery,” Amy Lueders, the Southwest regional director for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a statement. The agency didn’t immediately respond to an email Friday afternoon from The Associated Press. The Arizona eryngo is part of the carrot family and can grow more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. It relies on pollinators, such as butterflies and hummingbirds, to reproduce. Conservation efforts are underway to establish more populations of the eryngo."
3,Tundra Fire Raging Through Southwest Alaska Threatens Villages,environment," ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The largest documented wildfire burning through tundra in southwest Alaska was within miles of two Alaska Native villages, prompting officials Friday to urge residents to prepare for possible evacuation. This came a day after dozens of elders and residents with health concerns voluntarily evacuated because of smoke from the nearby fire. Officials on Friday put the communities of St. Mary’s and Pitkas Point into “ready” status, meaning residents should gather important items they would want to have with them if they have to evacuate, said U.S. Bureau of Land Management Alaska Fire Service spokesperson Beth Ipsen by text. That would be followed by “set,” or getting a go-bag ready and leaving if the “go” order is given. The fire is consuming dry grass, alder and willow bushes on the largely treeless tundra as gusts of up to 30 mph (48.28 kph) are pushing the fire in the general direction of St. Mary’s and Pitkas Point, Yup’ik subsistence communities with a combined population of about 700 people and about 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. There are about 65 firefighters battling the blaze, with about 40 more expected later Friday, Ipsen earlier said by phone. The fire had not grown much since Thursday and was still estimated at 78 squares miles (202 square kilometers). The northerly winds pushed the fire to within 5 miles (8 kilometers) of St. Mary’s, officials said in a late Friday update. Ipsen said she was not aware of any structures that have been lost. Crews cleared brush and other fuel from a swath of land in the path of the flames, and air tankers dropped retardant between the line and St. Mary’s as another buffer. Other aircraft had been dropping water on the fire until another fire broke out north of a nearby community, Mountain Village. Climate change has played a role in this historic fire, said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ International Arctic Research Center. He said based on records from the Alaska Fire Service dating back to the 1940s, this is the largest documented wildfire in the lower Yukon River valley. There are much bigger fires recorded just 50 or 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of St. Mary’s, but those burned in boreal forests. The area where the tundra fire is burning, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, lost its snowpack early this year, leaving grass and other vegetation longer to dry out. Coupled with the warmest period on record in the region recently, it provided for the perfect storm for this fire that was started by lightning on May 31. “Climate change didn’t cause the thunderstorm that sparked that fire, but it increased the likelihood that the ambient conditions would be receptive,” he said. The southwest Alaska hub community of Bethel, about 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) southeast of St. Mary’s, is the closest long-term weather station. For the period covering the last week of May and the first week of June, Bethel had its warmest temperatures on record this year, 9 degrees F (12.78 degrees C) above its normal 48 degrees F (8.89 degrees C), Thoman said. About 80 village elders and others with health concerns were relocated to the Alaska National Guard Armory in Bethel on Thursday, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Two companies that provide commuter air service in roadless western Alaska flew the passengers to Bethel. One of those was Yute Commuter Services, which provided 12 flights out of St. Mary’s on its planes that seat six, said Andrew Flagg, the company’s station manager in Bethel. On Friday, he said they were asked to deliver drinking water to the community so it could be given to the firefighters. St. Mary’s and Pitkas Point, which is at the confluence of the Andreafsky and Yukon rivers, are located about 450 miles (724 kilometers) west of Anchorage."
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Mysterious Hard Object Inside Catfish Turns Out To Be Sex Toy,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost You should have seen the one that got away. When Richard Kesar of Shelbyville, Indiana, took his friend Jon Hoop fishing on the Ohio River last week, the goal was for Hoop to land his first blue catfish. Well, he did, but this fish came with a secret toy surprise: a sex toy to be specific. (Warning: The photo below is not safe for work.) “We noticed when we got it in the boat that its stomach was huge,” Kesar told Bloomington, Indiana Fox affiliate WXIN. At first, he assumed it was because of eggs or maybe some wildlife the fish had eaten. “It’s common to find other fish, sometimes turtles, muskrats, and other animals,” he told the station. It wasn’t until later in the day that he actually pressed down on the catfish’s abdomen and felt two hard objects that he knew couldn’t be eggs. When they returned to Kesar’s home and cut open the catfish, they discovered what was bulking up the fish’s tummy: A foam ball, part of another fish and, oh, a fairly large-sized dildo. Or, as Kesar referred to it, “the other object.” Kesar posted photos of the catfish and that “other object” on his Facebook page, where it immediately aroused, er, interest to the tune of more than 19,000 shares as of Friday afternoon. It has also created some challenges for him as the Dad of a three-year-old girl. “When it came out, Jon, my wife, and I started laughing,” he told WXIN. “My wife immediately covered my daughter’s eyes and turned her away from it.” The daughter keeps asking what it is, but that’s probably a conversation for a different time. Kesar told HuffPost via Facebook that Hoop has the catfish, but he didn’t think his fishing companion had eaten it “yet.” Meanwhile, he still has “the other object,” but probably not for much longer. “I don’t have any use for it,” he said.

11,Bird Flu Spreads To Southwest After 37 Million Bird Deaths,environment," PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona officials have confirmed the first cases in the Southwest of a bird flu that has led to the deaths of 37 million birds from commercial farms in the central and eastern U.S. The disease was spotted after tests by federal wildlife officials in three wild cormorants that had been found dead in a park in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Arizona Game and Fish officials announced this week. The disease has not yet been found in any domestic birds or in commercial operations, the agency said. But it is a concern, according to Glenn Hickman, president and CEO of Hickman Family Farms, one of the largest egg producers in the Southwest. Hickman operates four chicken ranches in Arizona, one in California and two in Colorado. The company has stopped any visits to its farms and doublechecked its biosecurity program, which is designed to prevent its approximately 2 million chickens from being infected. Its chickens are kept in barns that are secured so that wild birds can't enter, and any people or tools that enter are disinfected. The company dodged a scare recently when the avian flu was found in a flock 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from one of its Colorado farms, Hickman said Thursday. And while he's concerned about the Scottsdale find, its not anywhere near as concerning as if a nearby commercial operation had an outbreak. “Those are a lot scarier because the massive amount of virus that is potentially produced when you have a large population is much more than the relatively small amount of virus per bird in the wild bird population,” he said. None of his farms were affected. Arizona Game and Fish officials have been closely monitoring for the disease, which had been no closer than Colorado before this week's announcement, by responding to all calls of dead birds. Anne Justice-Allen, the department's wildlife veterinarian, said calls from the public alerted her agency to the dead cormorants, water-loving birds that often nest in groups. The three juveniles had fallen out of their nests and were spotted dead by morning walkers in the park, who called wildlife officials. “It's a good thing they did,” Justice-Allen said, because they were able to collect the birds and test them before park workers removed them. “We had a high suspicion that it was something that we do not normally see,” Justice-Allen said. “We have resident cormorants in the area, and we do not normally see mortality events in them.” Justice-Allen said a major concern is backyard flocks of chickens, which are allowed in parts of metro Phoenix. The disease has been found in many homeowner flocks across the country. Bird owners should watch for symptoms like birds not eating or lethargy, runny noses, seizures or diarrhea, she said. Anyone seeing those symptoms should call the state Department of Agriculture. The first U.S. detection of the new strain of highly contagious avian flu in domestic poultry was in February in Indiana. More than 37 million birds have been killed to prevent the infection from spreading since then. As of June 3, it had been detected in wild birds in 40 states, but not in California, Arizona, Nevada or New Mexico. Commercial flocks in 19 states have been infected. Once an infection is found, the birds won't recover and are killed to prevent spreading the illness, Justice-Allen said. The outbreak has not only killed domestic fowl. It has also had a heavy toll on bald eagles and other wild bird species, much more so than the nation's last bird flu outbreak detected in 2014. That outbreak cost more than 50 million domestic poultry. Hickman said egg producers are so far making up for lost production from outbreaks affecting flocks this year. “I think I can speak pretty firmly that regardless of how many birds that have been affected and depopulated, there are still eggs on every shelf in every grocery store in America,” Hickman said."
12,Ryan Zinke’s Primary Struggles Thrust Montana Into Midterm Spotlight,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Ryan Zinke seemingly had it all: President Donald Trump’s “full endorsement,” name recognition and political clout at home, and lots and lots of campaign cash. The former Navy SEAL, congressman and Trump administration interior secretary was widely expected to cruise to victory in the Republican primary for Montana’s new House seat on Tuesday. Instead he floundered, barely eking out a win over Al Olszewski, a former state senator and hard-line conservative who painted Zinke as a self-serving liberal who “quit” Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Zinke late Thursday after a delay in Lincoln Country. Zinke defeated Olszewski by just over 1,600 votes, or 1.9 percentage points. In a statement, Zinke thanked voters for their “confidence that America can be fixed and for ignoring the political BS.” Zinke’s unimpressive performance sets the stage for what could prove to be a competitive midterm race as Republicans look to regain the majority in the House. “Logic would say the District 1 seat may be more in play during the general election,” said Chuck Johnson, a retired journalist who covered Montana politics for more than four decades. “It likely will be one of the most-watched House races nationally.” But Johnson stressed there are many factors — campaign messaging and tactics, fundraising and dark-money influence, and the extent to which national party committees get involved, if at all — that will determine just how tight things get. Montana’s new House district, which covers the western part of the state, was created last year to account for population growth in Big Sky Country. It is the first time Montana has had two House seats since 1993. When western Montanans head to the polls in November, they will be faced with two very different choices. Zinke, the muscle of Trump’s fossil fuel-centric “energy dominance” agenda who has made a small fortune consulting for oil, gas and mining interests since resigning under a cloud of scandal in early 2019, will square off against Monica Tranel, a rancher, two-time Olympic rower and environmental lawyer who successfully helped sue Northwest Energy over a 2007 Montana law that gave the utility giant pre-approval to construct energy projects. Tranel trounced the Democratic field on Tuesday — a race that many longtime political observers in Montana expected to be the more competitive of the primaries. In a statement after her win, Tranel took a swing at her expected GOP opponent, saying that Democrats and Republicans alike made clear on Tuesday that “they want a representative in Congress to represent them, rather than corporations that exploit them.” “Ryan Zinke had multiple chances to show up for Montanans, but instead of serving Montana, he served himself,” she said. “Zinke’s record of corruption has contributed to a primary result that shows his own party does not trust him.” Zinke was one of five candidates on the Republican ticket Tuesday. He campaigned as if he was a shoo-in for the Republican nomination, given his Trump credentials and previous stint as Montana’s at-large House member. He largely avoided talking to the press, with the exception of right-wing outlets, and did not show up for a single primary candidate forum, including one last month in his hometown of Whitefish. Through mid-May, he had raised nearly $3 million, far more than any other candidate in the race, and outspent everyone in the field by 2-to-1 or more. In the end, nearly 60% of Republican voters ultimately cast their ballot for someone other than Zinke. Many of those votes will be up for grabs in November. Even more notable, Zinke got walloped in his home county of Flathead, tallying just 31.5% of the vote to Olszewski’s 47.8%, according to the latest returns. “He is wounded, for sure. He’s vulnerable,” said Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign. “I think that, obviously, the positives that come with being a high-level person in the Trump administration appear to be offset by the negatives that come with the ethical lapses that have been widely publicized.” There are signs that Zinke’s camp knew it might be in trouble. In March and April, his campaign paid a public opinion research firm more than $50,000 to conduct voter surveys, expenditures show. And in the three days before the primary, western Montana voters received text messages that attacked Olszewski as “the wrong choice for Montana Conservatives,” according to copies of the texts a Montana resident shared with HuffPost. One of the texts included a pre-recorded voice memo from Donald Trump Jr. “There’s a better choice,” Trump Jr. said in the recording. “Republican Ryan Zinke is the true conservative Montanans can trust. That’s why my father, President Donald Trump, endorsed Ryan Zinke, because he’s the right choice for Congress.” The text message ads were paid for by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC with ties to both Zinke and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). Daines also endorsed Zinke in the Montana House race. William Foley — the billionaire founder and chair of title insurance company Fidelity National Financial and owner of the Vegas Golden Knights, an NHL franchise — is one of More Jobs, Less Government PAC’s largest funders. He gave the PAC $300,000 during the 2020 election cycle. That year, the PAC spent $895,000 opposing Daines’ challenger, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Foley, his wife and other Fidelity National employees have so far donated a combined $27,450 to Zinke’s current congressional bid, Federal Election Commission records show. That’s on top of the nearly $200,000 that employees and political action committees affiliated with the company reportedly contributed to Zinke’s previous two congressional campaigns. Zinke is best known as a face of Trump-era swampiness and corruption. He played an outsize role in advancing the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel, anti-environmental agenda and racked up nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions. One of those probes targeted his use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense, including when he and staffers chartered an oil company plane for a flight from Las Vegas to Montana. That flight, which cost more than $12,000, followed a “motivational speech” Zinke gave to the Vegas Golden Knights. The scandals ultimately caught up with him, and he resigned as interior chief in January 2019 — one day before Democrats took control of the House and the oversight authority that comes with it. Zinke has repeatedly dismissed the internal probes against him as “politically motivated attacks” and falsely claimed that he was cleared of all wrongdoing. And on the campaign trail in recent months, he all but promised to get revenge if elected and if Republicans take back the majority in the House of Representatives in November. “I think we need to hold people accountable, particularly in the Biden administration. It seems there is a lot there between Hunter Biden and the president himself,” Zinke told right-wing outlet Newsmax earlier this week. “I think we need to investigate some egregious acts, but I would say be [judicious] in our investigation and not abuse the power ... Just because the other team lies, cheats and steals, we should not bow to that bait.” Interior’s internal watchdog concluded in a report in February that Zinke had violated ethics rules and misused his office through his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and then lied to investigators about it. Following his departure from the Trump administration, Zinke cashed in with the fossil fuel interests he’d spent two years regulating. A financial disclosure his campaign filed in November, months after it was due, revealed that Zinke was paid a combined $1.36 million for consulting and other services in the two years after leaving the Trump administration. That included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from U.S. Gold Corp. and at least $5,000 each from several other fossil fuel interests. A good chunk of that income flowed in while Zinke was on the campaign trail railing against President Joe Biden for high gas prices, peddling industry talking points and touting his energy bona fides. Zinke’s industry ties, ethical shortfalls and ties to California — Politico reported last month that his wife designated a home she inherited in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence — took center stage in the primary. In a campaign ad released late last month, Olszewski highlighted several of Zinke’s scandals while at the Interior Department and declared that “flying high on the taxpayer dime isn’t cowboy, it’s California.” Those same issues will no doubt be fodder for attack ads in the coming months. As HuffPost reported this week, in the course of Zinke’s 14-year political career, he has shifted from a moderate, conservation-minded Republican to a hard-line conservative handcuffed to Trumpian ideology. When Newsmax asked Zinke earlier this month about the importance of Trump’s endorsement, he said the former president is “either going to be a king or a kingmaker.” And he dismissed Olszewski’s claim that he’s too liberal to represent Montana. “I don’t think President Trump endorses RINOs,” he said, referring to so-called “Republicans in name only.” Zinke still heads into the general election as the favorite. More than 26,000 more votes were cast in the Republican primary than in the Democratic primary for the western district. FiveThirtyEight.com gave Republicans a 10-point advantage to win the seat in November. In 2020, Trump won Montana by 16 points and Democrats lost every single statewide race. But Zinke’s primary performance has clearly energized Montana Democrats. “While Democrats are united around Monica Tranel and already gearing up for November, the Republicans start the race off in disarray,” Shelia Hogan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said in a statement Wednesday when the race was still too close to call. Jayson O’Neill, a conservation consultant and former aide to former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, said the primary revealed a schism among Republican voters in western Montana. He expects the results this week could bump the race to one of the top House battles of the midterms. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee maintains a “Districts in Play” list; Montana’s new House district is not currently on it, but some anticipate the committee could come to see the new Montana House seat as an opportunity. “It’s a big referendum that says people are fed up with Zinke, and they are willing to vote for pretty much anybody else,” O’Neil said.

13,There Could Be Major Consequences If Yellowstone Bison Become An Endangered Species,environment," National Reporter, HuffPost The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will spend the next year assessing whether to protect Yellowstone bison under the Endangered Species Act — a court-mandated move that could affect recent attempts to reestablish wild herds on tribal reservations across the West. The decision, published in the federal register by the Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday, stems from a series of lawsuits brought by the Buffalo Field Campaign and the Western Watersheds Project since 2014. Both groups want to see bison numbers in the park rise and hope to halt systematic culling outside Yellowstone National Park, which in some years has claimed more than 1,000 bison. “Bison are forced into boundaries,” said James Holt, the executive director of the Buffalo Field Campaign. “They’re slaughtered. They’re quarantined. The North American model of wildlife conservation is failing bison and we can do better.” The decision came as a surprise to many observers of Yellowstone bison, given how well the animals are doing by historical standards. “Market hunters” killed the animals en masse toward the end of the 19th century to sell their hides and tongues, nearly driving the animals to extinction. Only about two dozen bison lived in Yellowstone by 1902, according to the National Park Service. Conservation efforts since then, however, have helped Yellowstone’s bison rebound to around 5,500 today. “The Endangered Species Act is really designed to keep animals from becoming extinct,” said Jay Bodner, executive vice president of the Montana Stock Growers Association. “With a population of 5,500 on a growth trend, they certainly are not in that class.” The Fish and Wildlife Service has generally agreed, declining to recommend bison for Endangered Species Act protections twice in response to the lawsuits. But U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss found in January that the federal agency failed to consider recent genetic studies indicating that Yellowstone bison have evolved into two distinct herds, which in turn might warrant separate, higher population targets to protect genetic diversity. The Fish and Wildlife Service’s third assessment, conducted in response to Moss’s ruling, called for a year-long review of the petition to protect Yellowstone’s bison based on their genetic diversity. Endangered Species Act protections could have far-reaching and politically explosive impacts, if the Fish and Wildlife Service were to adopt them. Wild bison migrate long distances. Yellowstone bison typically push north along the river bottom when snow begins to fall, following forage to lower-elevation winter range, moving through private land in the process. But around 60% of wild bison carry brucellosis ― a bacterial disease brought to North America by beef cattle. Brucellosis exposure can devastate ranches, creating pressure to keep the animals away from domestic cattle as they migrate. “If Yellowstone bison could roam freely with the infection rate they have, our livestock trading partners would put severe restrictions on Montana,” Bodner said. To keep that from happening, federal and state agencies try to push bison toward public land as much as they can and haze them back into the park when they return to their summer range. Authorities also kill hundreds of Yellowstone bison each year and distribute the meat and hides to tribes, largely to ease tensions over brucellosis with ranchers and conflicts with other private property owners outside the park. It’s an awkward arrangement few are happy with. Montana conducts a highly coveted draw to hunt wild bison exiting the park, in which thousands apply for the chance at a few dozen licenses. Several tribes, exercising treaty rights, also hunt bison just outside the park under their own regulations. Historically, government authorities killed far more bison than hunters. Authorities culled about 1,115 Yellowstone bison in the winter of 2017-18, according to court filings. But over the last three years, the National Park Service has quarantined a small number of bison at the park to certify them as free from brucellosis, a process that requires multiple tests over more than a year. Under the Bison Conservation Transfer Program, the National Park Service has worked with tribes across the country to ship live bison to help establish new herds or bolster existing ones. The National Park Service plans to double the capacity of the program in coming years, partly as an alternative to sending bison to slaughter. Last year, the number of culled bison had dropped to 187. Extending Endangered Species Act protections raise questions about the program and may threaten tribal nations’ treaty rights, according to Eastern Shoshone Tribal Buffalo Representative James Baldes. Baldes spent the last 15 years restoring the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s bison herd. He called the transfer program a “success story that has restored many Yellowstone buffalo to tribes across the nation, and even to Alaska,” including his. Supporters of extending protections to Yellowstone bison say the law allows for exceptions to capture and transfer live animals to develop new populations. “Even if bison were listed in Yellowstone, the gathering of bison for reintroduction efforts would be allowed to continue,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project. “It’s pretty common for a very rare species to require trapping and relocation to establish new populations.” But the Secretary of the Interior must approve those exceptions, and populations receiving transfers are also protected, which could complicate the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s goal of hunting its wild herd. Neither the Fish and Wildlife Service nor the National Park Service responded to requests for comment. “I would hope the ESA does not impede the exercise of sovereignty around buffalo restoration, especially in terms of buffalo genetics,” Baldes said. “Those are the remnants of our once vast herds and the tribes should have first say in what happens to them.” “To list bison as an endangered species or a threatened species would greatly diminish the efforts to restore bison to tribal lands lands for cultural and ecological restoration,” Baldes said. “We know the genetics of Yellowstone are very important. We want to make sure that we’re getting those animals alive to ensure herd health.” Fights over whether to list a given animal under the Endangered Species Act are often more about politics than biology, according to South Dakota bison rancher Dan O’Brien, author of “Buffalo for the Broken Heart.” Like many others, he viewed the pressure to list bison as a threatened species with suspicion. But the law was also designed to respond to petitions with scientific assessments. Only scientific research can tell whether Yellowstone bison have genetics demanding extra protection. “I’ve worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service my entire life and they want to do the right thing,” O’Brien said. “I think we have to stand back and let the Act work.” CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this piece did not include information about how the ESA’s exemptions may affect tribal nations’ bison restoration programs. Details about those exemptions have been added following additional interviews with Baldes and Erik Molvar. National Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Galapagos Tortoise From Species Thought Extinct For 100 Years Is Found,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Researchers confirmed Thursday that a lone giant tortoise found wandering on an active volcano in the Galapagos is actually the only known member of a species thought to have become extinct more than 100 years ago. Scientists first found a female giant tortoise on the Galapagos’ Fernandina Island, which consists of a largely unexplored volcano, in 2019 in a clump of vegetation amid extensive lava fields. Though researchers had hoped to find a member of the species Chelonoidis phantasticus, also known as the fantastic giant tortoise, they expected the tortoise was actually a different species that may have been moved or carried to the island by a hurricane, rather than a native creature. They dubbed her Fernanda. To help uncover the mystery of Fernanda’s origin, researchers at Princeton and Yale fully sequenced Fernanda’s genome as well as the genome from the only other specimen of Chelonoidis phantasticus known to science, collected in 1906, and compared the data to every other living Galapagos giant tortoise species. “We saw — honestly, to my surprise — that Fernanda was very similar to the one that they found on that island more than 100 years ago, and both of those were very different from all of the other islands’ tortoises,” Stephen Gaughran, a co-author of a paper published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology. A tortoise from a Galápagos species long believed extinct has been found alive and now confirmed by #PrincetonU researchers to be a living member of the species. The tortoise, named Fernanda, is the first of her species identified in more than a century. https://t.co/ldRmyMNun5 The “fantastic” element refers to the shape of the males’ shells, which feature “extreme flaring along the outer edge and conspicuous saddlebacking at the front.” Fernanda is thought to be “well over” 50 years old, but the researchers said the island’s limited vegetation may have stunted her growth. They said scat and tracks show there may be two or three other tortoises on the island, raising hopes that Fernanda’s line could continue. She now lives at the Galapagos National Park Tortoise Center, a breeding and rescue facility. “The finding of one alive specimen gives hope and also opens up new questions, as many mysteries still remain,” Adalgisa Caccone, a research scientists at Yale and an author of the study, said in a statement. “Are there more tortoises on Fernandina that can be brought back into captivity to start a breeding program? How did tortoises colonize Fernandina, and what is their evolutionary relationship to the other giant Galápagos tortoises?” All 14 species of Galapagos tortoises are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of threatened species as either vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered or extinct. Populations were decimated by European explorers who hunted them for food, taking the tortoises aboard their ships, since they could survive with little effort and serve as a source of fresh meat for sailors.

1,"U.S. Proposes New Marine Sanctuary Off New York, Home To Sperm Whales And Sea Turtles",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration proposed a new marine sanctuary off the coast of New York on Wednesday and said it would move to ban the sale of single-use plastics from all public lands over the next decade. The White House said the measures, a slate of environmental moves announced on World Oceans Day, would help “conserve and restore the health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans.” The proposed national marine sanctuary would encompass the Hudson Canyon, a deep underwater valley that lies about 100 miles off the coast of New York and New Jersey. The canyon, one of the largest in the world, is up to 2.5 miles deep in parts and provides habitat for sperm whales, sea turtles, octopuses and deep sea corals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it would begin a public comment period on the matter and will then consider what it would be called and what areas it would encompass. The full process, which would also include an environmental impact analysis and management plan, could take more than a year, The Washington Post reported. “A sanctuary near one of the most densely populated areas of the Northeast U.S. would connect diverse communities across the region to the ocean and the canyon in new and different ways,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “As someone who grew up in New York City and went on to a career in ocean science, I am excited about how this amazing underwater environment can inspire shared interest in conserving our ocean.” Announcing: Hudson Canyon National Marine Sanctuary DesignationYou are invited to participate in the first step in the process to potentially designate a new national marine sanctuary off the coast of New York and New Jersey, known as Hudson Canyon.https://t.co/YvH6wY053q pic.twitter.com/KRWNOEZ4Ci The Interior Department also said Wednesday it would move to phase out the sale of single-use plastics on public lands by 2032, which includes national parks. The agency noted that plastic pollution remains a major problem on public lands, adding that less than 10% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled. “The Interior Department has an obligation to play a leading role in reducing the impact of plastic waste on our ecosystems and our climate,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “As the steward of the nation’s public lands, including national parks and national wildlife refuges, and as the agency responsible for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats, we are uniquely positioned to do better for our Earth.” The move was hailed by environmental groups. “Our national parks, by definition, are protected areas — ones that Americans have loved for their natural beauty and history for over a century — and yet we have failed to protect them from plastic for far too long,” Christy Leavitt, the plastics campaign director for Oceana, a nonprofit ocean conservation group, said in a statement. “The Department of Interior’s single-use plastic ban will curb millions of pounds of unnecessary disposable plastic in our national parks and other public lands, where it can end up polluting these special areas.” President Joe Biden campaigned on goals of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known as the “30 by 30” initiative. Those efforts included rolling back former President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle protections for several national monuments, but Biden has also pledged to establish new protected sites to address climate change and safeguard important ecological zones.

2,Damage Estimates Climb From Massive New Mexico Wildfire,environment," ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The destruction caused by the largest wildfire burning in the U.S. has been devastating for thousands of residents and their lives have been forever disrupted and altered, New Mexico's governor said Tuesday after touring the damage in one county. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham met with homeowners and local officials while surveying homes in two of the many small northern New Mexico villages that were overcome by flames during the past several weeks after two planned government operations meant to clear out overgrown areas of the forest went awry. The first-term Democrat is preparing for a visit Saturday with President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to make a quick stop in New Mexico to be briefed on the wildfires and the recovery efforts. The largest blaze has charred close to 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers) in the Sangre de Cristo mountain range, which sits at the southern edge of the Rocky Mountains. Much criticism has been levied by residents throughout the rural area because of the federal government's role in causing the fire. The governor's office confirmed Tuesday that several hundred homes are estimated to have been destroyed by the fire. That number will likely increase as inspections and documentation is ongoing. “I saw firsthand the irrevocable harm that has been caused, with historic homes and livelihoods lost to the flames,” the governor said in a statement following her tour. “But I was also reminded of New Mexicans’ resiliency — I saw neighbors helping neighbors with that same compassion that New Mexicans always show toward one another in tough times.” The governor also heard about where recovery aid has been helpful and where gaps remain. Lujan Grisham and other top elected officials have called for the federal government to cover 100% of recovery costs. Some also have asked for an independent investigation of the U.S. Forest Service's prescribed fire protocols even though the agency has put a hold on such operations pending its own inquiry. While New Mexico has felt the brunt of the fire season so far this year, much of the West has marked notably hot, dry and windy conditions. Predictions for the rest of the season do not bode well, with drought and warmer weather brought on by climate change worsen fire danger in overgrown forests around the region. The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that thousands of wildland firefighters were working toward containment of eight large fires that have burned more than 1,130 square miles (2,927 square kilometers). Five of those fires are in New Mexico, while Alaska, Arizona and Colorado each have one. In Alaska, crews were working to protect several structures from a fire burning west of Talkeetna."
3,Japanese Voyager Defies Age With Tremendous Journey Across Ocean,environment,"  Age wasn’t an obstacle for an 83-year-old Japanese oceangoer. In fact, he wants to keep sailing until he’s 100. Kenichi Horie, a yachtsman and the first man to sail solo across the Pacific Ocean, completed a two-month-plus trek across Pacific again on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. Horie, who sailed nonstop across the Pacific Ocean about 60 years ago, started his journey in San Francisco on March 27 and ended it in Japan. His most recent journey makes him the oldest person ever to complete a solo, nonstop trek across the world’s largest ocean, according to The Associated Press. Horie, in an interview with CNN, encouraged people to not let their dreams “stay as dreams.” “Have a goal and work towards achieving this, and a beautiful life awaits,” he said. His journey across the sea was met with challenges, including a storm soon after the start of his voyage and a “pushback from a strong tide,” AP reported. He packed medicine but used only eye drops and bandages. “I’m still in the middle of my youth,” he said. Horie’s 1962 journey inspired the Japanese adventure movie “Alone Across the Pacific” in 1963. He has also circumnavigated the globe from north to south as well as from east to west, used a solar-powered vessel to cross the Pacific Ocean in 1996 and traveled from Hawaii to Japan with a wave-powered boat in 2008. “I want to be a challenger as long as I live,” Horie said.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Biden Under Pressure From Green Groups To Designate His First National Monument,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost When the Antiquities Act turned 111 in June 2017, the landmark conservation law was under attack. Then-President Donald Trump had launched a review of more than two dozen national monuments designated or expanded under the act, arguing that recent administrations had abused it to “lock up millions of acres of land and water.” That review ended with Trump dismantling protections for three national monuments — two in Utah and a third off the East Coast. Five years later, dozens of national and local organizations are calling on President Joe Biden to mark the 116th anniversary of the Antiquities Act by establishing a new monument at Castner Range, a former military weapon testing facility in West Texas. The 7,000-acre landscape is home to archaeological sites and a diversity of rare and at-risk wildlife but is off-limits to the public due to unexploded ordnance from years of military testing. In a letter to Biden on Tuesday — a day ahead of the Antiquities Act’s anniversary — a coalition of 92 organizations wrote that doing so would “affirm your commitment to protecting our national treasures as well as help counteract a history of inequitable access to the outdoors.” The coalition includes national environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters and The Wilderness Society, as well as Texas-based organizations like Environment Texas and Frontera Land Alliance. Biden campaigned on a pledge to not only reverse Trump’s unpopular monument rollbacks but establish new protected sites to combat global climate change and safeguard ecologically important landscapes. He’s also set a goal of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, an initiative known informally as “30x30.” In October, Biden followed through on restoring Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, as well as Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the East Coast. But nearly a year and a half into his presidency, to the frustration of some conservation groups, Biden has yet to use his executive power to create a monument of his own. While many sweeping monument designations have proved controversial, particularly in states where the federal government controls large amounts of land, Castner Range has garnered widespread and growing support. In April, for example, the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an organization that represents current and former National Park Service employees, issued a report that identified six “national treasures in need of protection” and lobbied Biden to use his powers under the Antiquities Act. Castner Range was at the top of the group’s list. During a March visit to Castner Range, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland hiked lands adjacent to those being eyed for a future monument and met with local officials “to learn about their vision for increasing access to, and conservation of, outdoor spaces,” the Interior Department said in a press release at the time. Unlike in neighboring New Mexico, there are few open spaces for outdoor enthusiasts to hike and recreate in West Texas, said Janaé Field, executive director of El Paso-based conservation nonprofit Frontera Land Alliance. “There’s just so many people trying to access public spaces, and there’s just not enough room to accommodate all the footprints,” she told HuffPost. Field noted that the effort to protect Castner Range has been ongoing for more than five decades and said the landscape “checks all the boxes” for a national monument. In its letter, the coalition writes that a monument designation would help the Biden administration advance several priorities at once, from combating climate change and safeguarding biodiversity to correcting environmental injustices. Most state and local parks in and around El Paso charge admission fees that “create a significant additional barrier in equitable access” to the outdoors, the coalition writes. Signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act authorizes presidents to “declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.” Sixteen presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used it to create more than 150 monuments since 1906, including many sites that later became national parks. Field is hopeful that Castner Range will be the first of several national monuments Biden establishes during his presidency. “Hopefully, he ends a 51-year effort,” she said. “But if not, I don’t see the community stopping.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,How Ryan Zinke Went Full Trump,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost In 1976, a freshman jock and self-proclaimed “health nut” named Ryan Zinke ran for student body president on a pledge to bring a fruit stand to his rural high school in Whitefish, Montana. It proved to be a winning platform. But in an interview shortly after his triumph, Zinke acknowledged that his motivation was not so much giving his classmates a healthy alternative to the school’s popular candy machine. “Mainly it was a campaign move to get elected,” the 15-year-old, 6-foot-3 football, wrestling and swimming star told The Missoulian newspaper. Zinke has been doing and saying what it takes to get ahead ever since. The former Navy SEAL, state senator, congressman and Trump administration Cabinet member is once again on the campaign trail, this time running for Montana’s newly created House seat. The prohibitive front-runner, Zinke is among a group of former high-ranking Trump administration officials with a shot at entering elected office despite their roles in an unpopular, disastrous administration and their loyalty to a former president who went to great lengths to try to overturn a fair, legal election. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary for President Donald Trump, is the favorite for Arkansas’ next governor. Scott Pruitt, Trump’s scandal-plagued Environmental Protection Agency chief, is running for Senate in Oklahoma. Zinke is pitching himself as a “patriot” who can “save America” — from what he calls President Joe Biden’s “disastrous” energy and economic policies; from government overreach and the “COVID industrial complex”; from the “swamp” of lobbyists and influence in Washington, D.C., that his former boss vowed repeatedly to “drain” only to flood with industry alligators. Zinke often jokes that the swamp was one of the few issues he and Trump disagreed on. “I said, Mr. President, I’m secretary of the interior. There are some beautiful swamps in America,” Zinke chuckled during a January interview with the conservative podcast “District of Conservation.” “DC is not a swamp, it’s a sewer.” Swamp or sewer or “cesspool,” Zinke is asking Montana voters to send him back to a place he has benefited immensely from, professionally and financially. Running as if he is unopposed, Zinke has largely walled himself off from both the press and his would-be constituents. He grants interviews almost exclusively to right-wing outlets and radio hosts, where he can count on softball questions, and did not show up to a single candidate forum ahead of Tuesday’s primary, including one last month in his hometown of Whitefish. Zinke’s campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for an interview. Despite his Trump credentials, Zinke is one of five candidates on the Republican ticket Tuesday — each of them trying to out-Trump the others. Zinke’s loyalty to Trump has paid off: The ex-president endorsed Zinke in the race, as did Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) and Sen. Steve Daines (R). While there hasn’t been any polling on the race, FiveThirtyEight.com currently gives Republicans a 10-point advantage to win the newly created congressional seat in November. In 2020, Trump won Montana by 16 points and Democrats lost every single statewide race. Zinke is perhaps best known as a key soldier in Trump’s fossil fuel-centric energy crusade. He likes to portray himself as an “all-of-the-above” energy guy, someone who supports fossil fuels and renewables alike and doesn’t pick favorites when it comes to powering America. But his tenure at the helm of an agency that oversees roughly one-fifth of all land in the U.S. proved to be one massive gift to the fossil fuel industry — a top donor to his past and current congressional bids. Despite repeated assurances to prioritize conservation and create a legacy that would rival that of his hero President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke spent his days at the Interior Department loyally advancing Trump’s pro-extraction, anti-conservation agenda. He helped dismantle a slew of environmental protections and opened up millions of federal acres to drilling and mining. He dismissed and downplayed the threat of climate change and railed against “radical environmentalists.” By the end of his two-year stint, he sounded like a seasoned fossil fuel executive, at times referring to America’s oil and gas industry as “we.” The industry took notice. Weeks after resigning from the Cabinet post in January 2019 — or, reportedly, being forced out — under a cloud of ethics scandals, Zinke began cashing in. First, he landed a job as senior vice president of Artillery One, a little-known blockchain investment firm, after a serendipitous flight to Atlanta during which he sat next to and wooed the company’s chief executive with stories of achieving so-called “energy independence.” Weeks after that, he and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski joined lobbying firm Turnberry Solutions as senior advisers. And in April of that year, Zinke was tapped as a board member of mining exploration company U.S. Gold Corp. and promised to “help make mining great again in America.” It was not until nearly two years later, however, that the public learned just how much Zinke benefited from special interests following his departure from government, including companies he’d spent two years regulating. In November, months after it was due, Zinke’s campaign filed the financial disclosure that is required of all congressional candidates. It revealed Zinke was paid a combined $1.36 million for consulting and other services in the two years after leaving the Trump administration. That included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from U.S. Gold Corp., and at least $5,000 each from several fossil fuel interests, including pipeline company US Trinity, exploration and hydraulic fracturing company Oasis Petroleum, and Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an Oklahoma-based oil and gas lobbying firm that’s headed by oil billionaire and rabid Trump supporter Harold Hamm. “Certainly, his bread was buttered with petroleum jelly.” Zinke also reported $410,000 in income from a company listed as “JVL Enterprises” of Dallas. HuffPost could find no active JVL Enterprises in Dallas. Reached by phone, James Van Lare, who owned a JVL Ventures LLC outside Dallas and donated to Zinke’s campaign in June 2021, told HuffPost his company is no longer active and that he did not pay Zinke for consulting services. A review of Texas companies with “JVL” in their names leaves little doubt it was JVL Advisors, LLC, an oil and gas investment firm in Houston, that Zinke consulted for. The company’s founder and managing partner, John Lovoi, sits on the board of several other fossil fuel companies, including Roan Resources, Epsilon Energy, Helix Energy Solutions and Dril-Quip. Lovoi did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Zinke’s post-government honeymoon with big oil was predictable to anyone who closely followed his tenure at Interior. And his deep ties to planet-warming fossil fuels have taken center stage in the race for Montana’s new House seat, which was created last year and covers the western part of the state. Monica Tranel, one of three Democrats running to take on Zinke in November’s general election, wrote a letter to ConocoPhillips in April urging the company to drop Zinke from its payroll as a “symbolic” gesture of “belt-tightening” as Montanans struggle to afford high gas prices. Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Zinke’s campaign, fired back on Twitter, saying that Zinke had ended his relationship with the company months earlier to focus on the campaign. A ConocoPhillips spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost that Zinke was paid for consulting and advisory services until December 2021, but did not elaborate on the specifics of Zinke’s work for the company. That means that for approximately eight months after launching his campaign in April 2021, Zinke was collecting a hefty paycheck from one of the nation’s largest oil companies while running for public office on a vow to restore so-called “energy dominance.” During that time, Zinke often took to social media to complain about rising gas prices, peddle industry talking points and wish lists, demand more drilling amid rapidly worsening, fossil fuel-driven planetary warming, and even publicly ponder absurd, oil-friendly questions like “What happens when the wind runs out?” I'm all for clean energy - and solar and wind must be part of our energy mix where it makes sense - but we need other affordable and reliable options to power our current energy needs. pic.twitter.com/EeL2sduyIG On social media, Zinke frequently blames Biden for pain at the pump, ignoring the fact that domestic gas prices are inherently tied to a global market and that oil majors, including his recent client ConocoPhillips, have raked in record profits amid high prices. In an August 2021 interview with the right-wing Breitbart News, Zinke talked about the need for Americans to “rally together” and “learn to work together,” then slammed Biden’s energy policies as “anti-American,” bragged of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost oil and gas production and applauded American oil companies as “good players.” The interview allowed Zinke to plug and solicit donations for his congressional campaign, but included no mention that his clients at the time included ConocoPhillips. Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign, told HuffPost it is egregious that Zinke was collecting paychecks from the oil industry — “certainly, his bread was buttered with petroleum jelly,” he said — while simultaneously campaigning against the high gas prices that have led to skyrocketing oil industry profits. ConocoPhillips tallied $8.1 billion in profits in 2021, its most since 2013, and a stunning $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022. “If you’re running for Congress and asking people to be for you because you want to be their servant while you are getting paid as an adviser to a profiteering oil company, there’s some question about where your allegiance lies,” Barrett said. As with previous campaigns, Zinke has collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations from the fossil fuel industry. Through mid-May, he raised nearly $3 million, far more than any other candidate in the race. More than $124,000 of that came from industry employees and political action committees, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. Zinke’s largest donors include Cox Oil, oil and gas investment firm Colt Ventures, Hauptman Oil and Double Eagle Energy. Harold Hamm, the founder and chair of Continental Resources, gave Zinke $2,900. And several of Zinke’s former Interior colleagues — who, much like him, have spun through the revolving door to land jobs in industry or lobbying — have also supported his campaign. a few donations to Ryan Zinke's campaignBernhardt, Bloomgren & DeVito were all top Trump DOI officials & spun through the revolving🚪to land jobs in industry or lobbyingBernhardt: Brownstein HyattBloomgren: APIDeVito: Cox Oil(notice DeVito's dollar amount: 1776) pic.twitter.com/0Vyc3qannQ Zinke is leaning hard into his energy bona fides. He boasts often about how he and Trump made the U.S. “energy independent.” In a statement endorsing Zinke for the seat, Trump wrote that under Zinke’s leadership, “the U.S. achieved Energy Dominance, increased federal energy revenues, and responsibly opened federal acreage for energy production.” Zinke hasn’t defined what “energy independent” means; if he’s talking about a nation free of any imported petroleum products, the U.S. never achieved that under Trump. “Want to make gas cheap again, vote Zinke,” he wrote in an April post while filling a 30-gallon, gas-guzzling pickup truck with premium gasoline. A post shared by Ryan Zinke (@zinkeformontana) Along with restoring the U.S. as an oil and gas juggernaut — it’s unclear how he plans to do that as one of 435 members of the House — Zinke says his bid is about taking on division across the country. He cited those political fissures as his primary motivation for running, calling it “the biggest threat facing the country.” In other words, he’s campaigning on a pledge to unite Montana and the country around conservative values — his values. But those who have closely watched Zinke’s 14-year ascent up the political ranks say those values have been a moving target, his views shifting ever farther to the right as Montana’s political landscape changed and the Republican Party became handcuffed to Trumpian ideology. Political experts and observers in Big Sky Country that HuffPost talked to — a number of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly — described Zinke as an “opportunist,” a “political chameleon” and someone “you have trouble figuring out what he believes.” “He morphs into whatever he needs to, whatever is politically advantageous,” said Jayson O’Neill, a Montana resident, conservation consultant and former aide to former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer. In 2008, after 23 years in the Navy SEALS, Zinke retired and returned to Montana to launch a political career. That year, he ran and was elected to represent his hometown of Whitefish and parts of Flathead County in the Montana state Senate — a seat previously held by Democrat Dan Weinberg. Located in Montana’s mountainous northwest, Whitefish is a resort ski town and a gateway to popular Glacier National Park. Politically, it is a blueish island in a darkening sea of red. Zinke presented himself as a moderate, conservation-minded Republican and public land champion in the mold of Roosevelt. He approached the head of the Montana chapter of the League of Conservation Voters and assured him that he “wasn’t one to buckle under pressure,” the Flathead Beacon reported, and ultimately earned a rare endorsement from the environmental group. “I am about jobs. I am about conservation,” Zinke said in an interview shortly after taking office, in which he talked about his fondness for Roosevelt. “I think he got the word from someone that he better trim his sails on environmental stuff if he wanted to win a Republican nomination. He appeared to do that.” As a freshman state senator, Zinke drove a red Toyota Prius. He sponsored bills and backed legislation that found little support among hard-line conservatives. And in 2010, he signed on to a letter urging President Barack Obama and congressional leaders to ”pass comprehensive clean energy jobs and climate change legislation.” The letter called climate and the energy transition “America’s new space race,” and highlighted the national security and economic risks of failing to take aggressive action to confront the threat. Zinke found himself on stable footing with local environmentalists. In its 2011 report card, Montana Conservation Voters gave Zinke a 60% score — a six-point improvement over his 2009 grade and the highest mark of any Republican that session — and applauded him for “standing up for clean water and energy security in Montana.” Similarly, the Montana Environmental Information Center gave Zinke a 53% score. That session, Zinke voted against a bill that would have weakened the Montana Environmental Policy Act and was just one of two Republicans to oppose a referendum aimed at weakening Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. But Zinke had his sights set on higher office, and it didn’t take long for him to start molting his moderate feathers. “I think he got the word from someone that he better trim his sails on environmental stuff if he wanted to win a Republican nomination,” said Chuck Johnson, a retired journalist who covered Montana politics for more than four decades. “He appeared to do that.” “He started realizing that in order to get ahead in the Republican Party, he had to be more conservative, especially to win a primary,” said another longtime Montana political observer who requested anonymity. In 2012, Zinke ran unsuccessfully for Montana’s lieutenant governorship on a ticket with gubernatorial candidate and eccentric businessman Neil Livingstone. As Mother Jone reported, Livingstone’s campaign bio boasted of having partied with pirates, “dined at gangster clubs in Moscow and in the back rooms of Georgian and Uzbek restaurants with members of the Russian Mafia” and being “stalked by terrorists and Nazis in Argentina.” Livingstone never stood much chance of winning. And some saw Zinke’s decision to join the ticket as little more than an opportunity to boost his name recognition and test the waters for statewide office. In doing so, however, Zinke undermined his brand as a defender of America’s public lands. He and Livingstone each signed the Montana Constitutional Governance Pledge, an extreme document that, among other things, supported handing over control of federal lands to states and dismissed the federal agencies that Zinke would later oversee as “bureaucracies that have sprung up to enforce the unlawful seizure of our native land and its resources.” That pledge was the beginning of a slow but steady shift away from the moderate Republican unafraid to buck his own party — a shift that Zinke has managed to convince many hasn’t taken place. Barrett, the Democratic adviser, was working for Schweitzer when Zinke was a state senator. He said he and Zinke had a positive working relationship, that Zinke was pragmatic, someone who would reach across the aisle to get things done, and that he considered him a “bit of a friend.” He subcribes to the theory that Zinke chose not to run for a third term in the state Senate in 2012 because, by then, the Republican Party in Flathead County had moved far to his right and there was concern his moderate record would not survive a primary challenge. In 2014, two years after stepping away from politics, Zinke launched his first successful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. Barrett said it quickly became clear that Zinke had himself moved to the right. During one campaign stop in January 2014, he famously called Hillary Clinton the “Antichrist” and the “real enemy.” “I can’t say whether that was calculated or genuine, whether he’d drunk the Kool-Aid or was only pretending he’d drunk the Kool-Aid,” Barrett said of Zinke’s shift. Either way, it worked. Over his two-plus years in Congress, Zinke emerged as a reliable pro-industry, anti-environment vote. He tallied an abysmal 4% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters; a record that no doubt appealed to Trump and his team. “I can’t say ... whether he’d drunk the Kool-Aid or was only pretending he’d drunk the Kool-Aid.” Still, Zinke’s nomination to lead the Interior Department found support among hunting, fishing and wildlife conservation groups. Many saw Zinke as the most palatable name on a shortlist that included oil tycoon Forrest Lucas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and they hung their hats on Zinke’s decision in 2016 to resign as a delegate to the Republican National Convention over the party’s support for transferring control of federal lands to states. Zinke ultimately sailed through the Senate confirmation process, with 17 members of the Democratic caucus voting in support. After being sworn in, Zinke arrived for his first day as Interior chief wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat and riding a horse named Tonto and pledged to “faithfully uphold Teddy Roosevelt’s belief that our treasured public lands are ‘for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.’” In the end, however, his legacy was not one of conservation stewardship, but of catering to extractive industries, gutting safeguards for the environment and imperiled species and championing the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history. Along the way, he racked up nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions, lost the support of many in the outdoor sporting and conservation community and drew comparisons to Regan-era Interior Secretary James Watt, widely considered among the most anti-environment Cabinet appointees in U.S. history. As Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the president, put it in an interview with HuffPost shortly before Zinke’s resignation in late 2018: Zinke’s “bad angels won out.” Now back on the campaign trail, Zinke is clinging to his Roosevelt-style brand while embracing Trumpian “America First” jingoism and painting himself a victim of a coordinated, left-wing attack. A proud veteran, Zinke talks about his own political journey as if he’s still on a battlefield. He likes to joke about how serving as a SEAL was easier than leading the Interior Department because “when people shot at you as a SEAL, you could shoot back.” He boasts often about how he’d “rather charge up a hill under fire than cower in a foxhole.” And The Associated Press reported that at a recent Republican dinner in Butte, Zinke dubbed himself the “battleship” of the District 1 race and all other candidates as “canoes.” “Everybody wants to shoot at the battleship. Nobody shoots at the canoes,” he said. I live by Theodore Roosevelt’s ethos that it’s better to charge up the hill under fire than cower in the fox hole. I’ve taken a lot of fire, but I’m not backing down: https://t.co/vSO5uYiOIo pic.twitter.com/xqnKh843KY In Zinke’s mind, everyone is out to get him — political opponents, the media and Washington itself. In interviews with right-wing media, he frequently rants about “the resistance movement,” “entrenched bureaucracy,” the so-called “Deep State” and “cancel culture” he says he faced in D.C., including among Interior Department staff. “When you drain the swamp, it exposes serpents. And they attack!” he said in a recent campaign-style video posted to Instagram. “As interior secretary, I got an extra dose of fake news and false charges. And now, running for Congress, it’s happening again.” In the video, Zinke goes on to falsely claim, as he so often has, that the federal probes cleared him of any wrongdoing and that “you won’t read that in the fake news.” In a February report, Interior’s internal watchdog concluded that Zinke violated ethics rules and misused his office with his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and that he lied to investigators about it. Zinke’s campaign dismissed the report as a “political hit job” by the Biden administration, despite the fact that it was issued by Mark Greenblatt, the Trump-nominated inspector general of the agency. I’ve been shot at before. Doesn’t matter if it’s a terrorist or the deep state. I don’t back down. pic.twitter.com/Sl1LMfBf6y Some of his scandals have been more anodyne. At Interior, he revived an obscure military tradition, insisting that a special flag fly above the agency’s headquarters each time he walked through the door — a practice that his team comically claimed was “a major sign of transparency.” And despite his perceived image as an avid hunter and angler, Zinke showed up to a 2017 outing with Outside magazine correspondent and Montana resident Elliot Woods with his fly reel rigged backward. More recently, Zinke has come under fire for his ties to California. Politico reported last month that his wife had designated a home she inherited in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence — a revelation that became immediate fuel for one of his main Republican primary opponents, former state Sen. Al Olszewski. For all his talk of draining the swamp, Zinke has become a face of Trump-era corruption — someone who was plagued by scandal, prioritized the interests of powerful industries and ultimately made a small fortune working for those same special interests immediately after leaving office. And for all his lamenting about division and anger being “the greatest threat facing America,” Zinke is running an increasingly divisive campaign. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency. He’s worked to drum up fear that the Biden administration threatens to destroy the country and Montanans’ way of life. “In naval terminology, it’s heading to Davy Jones’s locker,” he told Breitbart in January. He’s accused Democrats in Washington of “smoking crack” and posted a picture of him branding a calf with the words “Let’s Go Branding,” a cowboy twist on the popular conservative phrase meaning “Fuck Joe Biden.” And he’s dismissed Americans who got vaccinated against COVID-19 as “little communists.” Whereas promises of fresh fruit and invoking Roosevelt proved to be winning tactics for Zinke in the past, today he’s betting that talk of so-called “energy dominance,” sidling up to a former president who tried to overthrow democracy, and attacking the press and anyone who doesn’t share his views will be enough to stamp his ticket back to Washington. He may very well be right. Whitney Tawney, executive director of Montana Conservation Voters, the environmental group that endorsed Zinke back in 2008, said watching Zinke’s rise to power has been “disappointing” and “disheartening.” Once someone Montanans could count on to walk the walk on conservation, he has, over time, “turned his back on” voters and prioritized lining his own pockets, she said. Tawney compared Zinke to the so-called “Copper Kings,” a trio of rival industrialists that ruled Butte, Montana in the late 1800s. “Unfortunately, he sort of forgot who his real bosses were,” Tawney said.

12,"Bill Banning Pet Stores From Selling Dogs, Cats And Rabbits Passes New York Legislature",environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A bill that would ban pet stores in New York state from selling dogs, cats and rabbits has passed the state legislature and is awaiting the signature of Gov. Kathy Hochul (D). The bill, which passed the legislature this week, is largely aimed at fighting large-scale “puppy mill”-style breeding operations. However, the bill does not directly target these facilities ― many of which exist outside of New York and thus outside the jurisdiction of New York state law. Instead, it focuses on pet stores, which primarily source their pets from such places, according to the animal welfare advocates and lawmakers who back the bill. “Right now, out of state puppy mills ship their puppies via a pipeline of middlemen to New York pet stores, where they are marketed as healthy puppies from responsible breeders,” Maureen Linehan, a spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said in an email to HuffPost. The bill encourages pet stores to partner with shelters and rescue groups and to use their retail spaces to “showcase” animals up for adoption. New York’s legislation would not totally prohibit people from purchasing animals from breeders. It would still be legal for breeders to sell animals directly to prospective pet owners; the legislation would only prohibit selling by third-party retailers like pet stores. The bill has support from numerous animal advocacy groups, including the ASPCA, The Humane Society of the United States, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the New York State Animal Protection Federation, among others. However, the legislation has faced opposition from the pet retail industry, as well as from the American Kennel Club. The AKC routinely advocates against retail pet sale bans, arguing that the laws are “anti-breeder” and hurt consumers in the market for pets. New York state has one of the highest concentrations of pet stores that sell puppies in the country, according to the ASPCA. That makes the bill especially significant. In 2017, California passed a law banning pet shops from selling nonrescue cats, dogs and rabbits. Maryland, Maine, Illinois and Washington state have all since passed similar laws. Additionally, numerous cities and towns across the country have enacted retail pet bans at the local level. Prior to this bill, New York City already banned pet stores from selling rabbits ― though not cats and dogs ― in part because of welfare issues specific to the long-eared animals. Some people mistakenly think of rabbits as low-maintenance “starter pets,” when in reality, they need highly specialized care. One of the country’s most comprehensive retail pet bans is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where pet stores are barred from selling birds, reptiles, spiders and small mammals like hamsters and gerbils ― unless the animals come from a shelter or rescue group. The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals advocated for the law, citing the poor conditions these animals often experience in high-volume breeding operations.

13,Charity Accuses Soldiers Of Blow-Dart Attacks On Stray Cats At Hawaii Army Barracks,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost An animal rescue outfit in Honolulu said people are shooting blow darts at stray cats around Schofield Army Barracks, suggesting the culprits are soldiers who allegedly purchased the weapons during recent training in Indonesia. The military says it’s on the case. Multiple cats have been injured, KAT Charities wrote on Facebook Thursday. A local animal hospital confirmed to KHON that it had treated one of the cats. KAT shared a photo of the feline, named Katniss, with the blow dart still embedded in the neck. “U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii was just made aware and is initiating an investigation into these reports,” the installation said in a statement to the TV station. “We cannot speculate about the details at this time while the investigation is ongoing. We ask that witnesses with first-hand information contact Schofield Barracks Military Police at (808) 655-5555. This type of behavior is not tolerated on the installation and is not in keeping with our Army values.” Kat Charities Founder Dr. Karen Tyson hoped the Army would expedite its probe. “While we want to give the commanders the opportunity to investigate the situation, we worry animals will continue to be harmed,” Tyson said, per KITV. “We have only captured one of the injured cats, while others are still on base suffering with these blow darts in them, including at least one cat with a blow dart in its head.” Tyson also said cats were found near a Popeyes restaurant on the base with their stomachs slit open. “While extremely graphic, we believe it is important to note that the animals appeared to have been purposefully mutilated as opposed to accidentally hit by a car,” Tyson said.

14,Court Rules That California Bees Can Be Fish And Have The Same Protections,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A California court ruled this week that bees can be legally considered “fish” for the purposes of a key state conservation law, and afforded the same protections. The decision Tuesday by California’s Third District Court of Appeal overruled a lower court’s declaration two years ago that the California Fish and Game Commission could not list invertebrates under the California Endangered Species Act. But the act is part of the California Fish and Game Code, which defines a fish as “a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, amphibian.” Including the word “invertebrate” in the code was enough for bees to buzz through, the court said. “The issue presented here is whether the bumble bee, a terrestrial invertebrate, falls within the definition of fish, as that term is used in the definitions of endangered species,” the court said in the decision. “Although the term fish is colloquially and commonly understood to refer to aquatic species, the term of art employed by the Legislature in the definition of fish in section 45 is not so limited,” the court explained. The challenge to the 2020 ruling was brought by the Stanford Environmental Law Clinic, which represented the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, the Center for Food Safety and Defenders of Wildlife. “We are celebrating today’s decision that insects and other invertebrates are eligible for protection” under the state endangered species act, Sarina Jepsen, the Xerces Society’s director of endangered species, said in a statement. “The court’s decision allows California to protect some of its most endangered pollinators, a step which will contribute to the resilience of the state’s native ecosystems and farms,” Jepsen added.

15,The Rudest Things You Can Do At The Dog Park,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Going to the dog park is a great way to help your pet socialize, move around and get some fresh air. But not every canine knows how to behave there. The same goes for humans. In fact, there are several common rude behaviors dog owners display in this context. “Etiquette is all about being mindful of other people, which certainly applies to the dog park,” Nick Leighton, an etiquette expert and co-host of the “Were You Raised by Wolves?” podcast, told HuffPost. To help make the dog park a safe and enjoyable setting for everyone, HuffPost asked Leighton and other etiquette experts to share the faux pas they’ve observed ― and their advice for avoiding these missteps. Here are eight of the rudest things you can do at the dog park. “The rules about picking up after your pet aren’t suspended in a dog park,” Leighton noted. When your dog goes, it’s your responsibility to clean it up, and there’s little excuse for failing to do so. “Most parks are well-supplied with waste pickup bags and plenty of trash cans, so please do your part,” said Camp Bow Wow animal health and behavior consultant Erin Askeland. “Be sure to pay attention to your dog at all times,” Leighton advised. Keep a close eye on what your pup is doing and resist the urge to tune out. Stay vigilant and keep your leash handy in case the two of you need to make an early exit. “In addition to monitoring your dog’s behavior, it’s common courtesy to be sociable with the other pup parents, complimenting them on the cuteness of their canine companion and making pleasant conversation,” said Thomas P. Farley, aka “Mister Manners.” “To let one’s dog roam free while you catch up on email, disengaging with everyone in the enclosure ― including your pet ― is a no-no.” If you’re distracted on your phone, you’ll also miss out on the opportunity to “engage with your dog, practice recall, ensure play is appropriate, provide breaks in play, and monitor your dog’s body language,” Askeland noted. Avoid bringing young children who need constant supervision to the dog park, if possible, as their presence will make it difficult to monitor your dog. “You don’t know the other dogs and need to keep your focus on your own dog,” Askeland said. “Adding small children is dangerous to the child and the dogs in the park.” Toddlers and babies may also be at risk of harm from rowdy dogs, especially if there are animals present who are unfamiliar with little kids. “While at the dog park, people should ensure their dog is interacting with other dogs in an appropriate manner,” said animal behaviorist and consultant Kate Mornement. “Dogs that are aggressive or reactive towards other dogs should not be taken to dog parks. Try to ensure your dog and the other dog it interacts with are having a good time. If your dog is playing too rough with another dog, it’s best to intervene and call your dog away.” Don’t allow your dog to bully other dogs or steal and shred up their toys. Look out for any aggressive, dangerous behavior. “Dog parks are wonderful places for well-behaved and socialized dogs who enjoy the company of other dogs,” Mornement said. “However, not all dogs are well-behaved or socialized and this can cause problems at the dog park.” “In some ways, dog runs can be for canines what Las Vegas is for humans: For these lucky pups, what happens on the dog run stays in the dog run!” Farley said. “Being off-leash, doggies excitedly embrace the rare sensation of liberation. But while dogs will let down their guards, their humans should not. Being aware of securing the dog-run gate while coming and going is rule number one.” Pay attention to the gates at fenced-in dog parks. Many of these have double-gated entrances to prevent off-leash dogs from escaping. Pause before you open a gate, especially if you notice lots of dogs hanging around the area, and look out for any pets trying to make a hasty exit. Be sure to properly close and latch any gates behind you as well. “Don’t give food to other dogs at the park,” Askeland advised. “You don’t know the other dogs and whether or not they can have food you may offer.” On a similar note, don’t bring your own human food to snack on in this space. In addition to potentially endangering other dogs, you probably won’t enjoy being swarmed by pups looking for a snack. Don’t go to the dog park with a canine that is unvaccinated, sick or under 4 months old. In addition to being vulnerable, they might also put other pets at risk. Only bring your dog if they are up to date with their shots and any other requirements the park may have in place. “Make sure your pup is vaccinated and protected against fleas, ticks and other parasites,” Askeland said. “This helps keep other pups safe too.” “Dogs that are fearful and nervous around unfamiliar dogs should also not be taken to dog parks,” Mornement said. “This is because these dogs are not enjoying the dog park environment and this can make their behavior worse.” Make sure your dog’s behavior is appropriate for a dog park before you take them to one. “This is not the place to test whether your dog enjoys playing with other dogs or a place to help a dog learn to play,” Askeland said. “If you’ve recently added a dog to your home, you should wait until your dog has adjusted to his/her home and you have gotten to know your dog and his/her body language and normal interactions before deciding whether the dog park is the right place to visit.” That way, you can watch your dog’s body language at the park and remove them if they’re showing signs that they aren’t comfortable. “Understand that not all dogs are great with a dog park, and it’s OK if your dog does not go to a dog park,” Askeland added.

0,"Pregnant Sea Turtle Attacked By Shark Gets To Deliver Eggs, Endures Surgery",environment," MIAMI (AP) — A loggerhead turtle whose left fin was destroyed in a shark attack is rehabbing at Zoo Miami’s new Sea Turtle Hospital, where veterinarians were able to save more than 100 of her eggs after she was rescued. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission sent the turtle to the hospital on May 22 after she was found at the Port St. Lucie power plant, Ron Magill, the zoo’s communications director said. An ultrasound determined that the 50-year-old, 388-pound (176-kilograms) turtle was pregnant. She also had scars on the shell that indicated it had been previously hit by a boat and attacked by another shark earlier in life, officials said. The hospital staff stabilized the turtle, dubbed Baymax, in a recovery tank and gave her fluids, vitamins and food that included squid and crab. Then, on Memorial Day, she was moved to a sand-filled pen and given calcium and oxytocin to stimulate her labor. By Tuesday morning she had deposited over 100 eggs. Then they prepared to treat her shark bite injury. During a seven-hour surgery a team led by Zoo Miami associate veterinarian Marisa Bezjian and assisted by chief veterinarian Gwen Myers, the exposed bone was removed and the surrounding wound was cleaned and treated. More eggs also emerged, and like the others, they were taken in a bin of sand to the Miami-Dade Parks Sea Turtle Conservation Program, to incubate in a man-made nest, Magill said. Baymax provided a early launch for the hospital, which recently passed inspection and had permission to accept sick and injured turtles, but won’t officially open until next month, Magill said. While it’s not uncommon for sea turtles to lose limbs to sharks or boat strike, many adjust and lead productive lives. That’s the hope for Baymax. Officials said she’ll be closely monitored for several weeks until she’s healthy enough to return to the wild."
1,Curious Cougar Corralled In California Classroom,environment," PESCADERO, Calif. (AP) — A quick-thinking custodian safely confined a curious cougar in an empty classroom after it entered a Northern California high school Wednesday morning, authorities said. The custodian was opening Pescadero High for the school day when the juvenile mountain lion was spotted, said Detective Javier Acosta with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office. No students or teachers were on campus at the time, Acosta said. “The mountain lion casually walked through campus and decided to go into an English classroom,” he said. “The custodian acted quickly and managed to shut the door behind it.” Acosta said the animal, estimated to be about 40 pounds (18 kilos), appeared “lost and scared.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife tranquilized the cat and sent it to the Oakland Zoo for examination. The underweight male was estimated to be 4 to 6 months old and had a fractured tooth that will need to be extracted before the cat can be released back into the wild, KTVU-TV reported. Pescadero is a small coastal community about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of San Francisco."
2,Bison Gores Woman In Yellowstone National Park,environment," YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) — A bison gored a 25-year-old woman in Yellowstone National Park. The bison was walking near a boardwalk at Black Sand Basin, just north of Old Faithful, when the woman approached it on Monday, according to a park statement. She got within 10 feet (3 meters) before the animal gored her and tossed her 10 feet into the air. The woman from Grove City, Ohio, sustained a puncture wound and other injuries. Park emergency medical providers responded and transported her via ambulance to a hospital in Idaho. Park officials say it’s the first reported bison goring this year. The park statement said bison are unpredictable, have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal and can run three times faster than humans. Park regulations require visitors to remain more than 25 yards (23 meters) away from bison. The park statement said two other people were also within 25 yards of the same bison. The incident was under investigation. No additional information was immediately available."
3,Scientists Find World’s Largest Plant In Australia,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY ― Researchers have made a startling discovery beneath the waters off Western Australia. A meadow of sea grass stretching more than 110 miles long was actually a single plant that had spent the past 4,500 years cloning itself to carpet an area three times larger than Manhattan. The findings, published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, make the colony of Posidonia australis, or ribbon weed, the largest known plant on Earth, scientists said. Elizabeth Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the University of Western Australia and a lead author of the study, said her team has been testing seagrass meadows around Australia for genetic diversity for years to see how they respond to climate change. When her team visited an area known as Shark Bay, a relatively pristine landscape untouched by development, they went beneath the waves to collect samples of seagrass to see what types of plants were growing across the ocean floor. The answer was one. “It’s quite bizarre when you think about it, there’s this plant in one end of the bay and then you move 100 kilometers down to the other end and it’s the same plant,” Sinclair said. Her team hypothesized that thousands of years ago, a single seagrass seedling landed in the bay. It was particularly suited to survive in different oceanic environments due to its unusual genome. Most comparable plant offspring contain 50% of each parent’s genes. But Posidonia australis has 100% from each parent, making it a polyploid, meaning it has double the usual number of chromosomes. “Polyploid plants often reside in places with extreme environmental conditions, are often sterile, but can continue to grow if left undisturbed, and this giant seagrass has done just that,” Sinclair said in a statement. “Even without successful flowering and seed production, it appears to be really resilient, experiencing a wide range of temperatures and salinities plus extreme high light conditions, which together would typically be highly stressful for most plants.” The ribbon weed has slowly grown through a series of runners — like a normal turf lawn — to stretch nearly 80 square miles. The researchers estimate its age at about 4,500 years, based on the species’ size and growth rate. Like other delicate oceanic structures, namely corals, seagrass meadows are susceptible to climate change. A severe heat wave in 2010 and 2011 sparked widespread damage to the Shark Bay meadows, killing about a third of the seagrasses. Underwater meadows are also home to many different species and serve a key role in an area’s biodiversity. “You lose a plant that creates this whole environment and you lose all the biodiversity that goes with it,” Sinclair said, adding that the 2010-2011 event had calamitous effects. “The turtles were going hungry, the dolphins weren’t getting enough fish, the whole network is connected.” Although the ribbon weed has already begun to recover and spread since that event, Sinclair cautioned that climate change still poses a threat to region. She also noted that it was “scary” how researchers had only just discovered the remarkable colony hiding beneath the waves, noting climate change could rip such species away before humans had a chance to discover them. “It’s scary because we might lose it before we find out about it,” Sinclair said. “It might be gone before we even know.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Matthew Wilson of the Brunswick Police Department told the newspaper it was actually a 3.5-foot-long ball python, a nonvenomous constrictor snake. “I ended up catching it with a broom handle,” Wilson told the Daily News. “I just got it where I could secure its head. Then I put him in a paper bag and carried him out.” Wilson said he suspects the restaurant left its back door open and the snake slithered in for the same reason as the customers: It was hungry and thirsty. Wilson, who has a ball python of his own, said the Sonic snake has a new home with a snake-loving friend. There was a holdup Saturday at the Sonic Drive-In, but not the type for which police are typically called. https://t.co/x4MPhhdt8x Eammon Leonard, an invasive species biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, told The Associated Press snakes are often an impulse buy that some purchasers later regret. “It could be somebody just didn’t think through the consequences of a large snake as a pet,” Leonard told AP. “Some people have regrets later on and just release things. It is definitely irresponsible.” People who are no longer able to care for a pet snake should contact a local reptile rescue or animal shelter for advice, and not release them into the wild. In addition to freaking out local underpaid and under-appreciated fast food workers, released snakes and other pets could lead to invasive species issues. Zoocheck, a Canada-based wildlife advocacy group, also noted that many of those once-loved pets often meet a grim fate. “The majority of these animals are stressed, physically depleted and unable to survive,” Zoocheck said on its website. “Most die of starvation, cold or predation.” Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
11,20-Year-Old Drowns In Notoriously Deadly Georgia Lake,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Seven people were killed on Georgia waterways over a busy holiday weekend, officials reported, including one who drowned in a lake with a dark history. Five people were killed and four injured in a two-boat collision Saturday on the Wilmington River near Savannah, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Four of the dead were from a single family. Searchers didn’t locate three of the bodies until Sunday morning. The cause of the crash is still under investigation. One of the survivors has been charged with boating under the influence, the Savannah Morning News reported. #BreakingNews @USCG, partner agencies searching for 3 men after 2 boats collided in the Wilmington River, about 1.5 miles north of Thunderbolt Marina, Saturday.More to follow. pic.twitter.com/838wZF9TtM Warning: The below video shows a body being recovered from the water. #Update 2: Press release: https://t.co/IS7PtciOzG pic.twitter.com/Ff8Y8fyjUS “Rough day today out here,” Bill Koster, the chief of operations for Chatham County Emergency Services, told reporters Saturday following the collision. A town is also mourning the drowning death of 5-year-old Kaiden Franklin, who vanished while playing on a float Saturday on Lake Allatoona at Clear Creek in northwest Georgia. His body was found later that afternoon, according to the Georgia DNR. He had just graduated from kindergarten at Model Elementary School in Rome. “Our deepest pain is having to share the passing of one of our own school babies,” the school said in a statement on Facebook. A 20-year-old man was also found drowned Sunday in Lake Lanier at a Margaritaville resort in the foothills of northern Georgia, the Forsyth County News reported. Police were withholding his identification pending notification of his family. More than 200 people have died in swimming and boating accidents since 1994 in the lake, which has an unusual, spooky history. The popular 38,000-acre lake north of Atlanta was created in the 1950s by deliberately flooding valley communities and covering up existing cemeteries. Ecologists continue to slam the lake’s damage to the natural environment, and many locals are convinced it’s haunted. One enduring tale involves the “Lady of the Lake,” dressed in blue, who’s supposed to be a woman who drowned in 1958. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Season's 1st Hurricane Makes Landfall In Mexico Tourist Zone,environment," MEXICO CITY (AP) — Agatha, the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in May in the eastern Pacific, swept ashore on a stretch of tourist beaches and fishing towns in southern Mexico on Monday. Torrential rains and howling winds whipped palm trees and drove tourists and residents into shelters. Oaxaca state’s civil defense agency showed families hustling into a shelter in Pochutla and a rock and mud slide that blocked the highway between that town and the state capital. Agatha made landfall about 5 miles (10 kilometers) west of Puerto Angel as a strong Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained wings of 105 mph (165 kph). It was moving northeast at 8 mph (13 kph). Near Puerto Angel, gusts of wind, heavy rain and big waves began lashing the beach town of Zipolite, long known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe. 8pm EDT 29 May-- A large & complex area of low pressure is expected to form over Central America in a few days, related to the remnants of Hurricane Agatha in the Pacific. There is low chance (30%) of TC formation within this system in the next 5 days.https://t.co/g9YgY32HIu pic.twitter.com/SK9IPq6HYn “There is a lot of rain and sudden gusts of strong wind,” said Silvia Ranfagni, the manager of Zipolite’s Casa Kalmar hotel. “The ocean is really stirred up, and it’s raining a lot,” said Ranfagni, who has decided to ride out Agatha at the property. “You can hear the wind howling.” National emergency officials said they had assembled a task force of more than 9,300 people for the area and more than 200 shelters were opened as forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge and flooding from heavy rains. After forming on Sunday, Agatha quickly gained power, and it made landfall as a strong Category 2 hurricane Monday afternoon, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Agatha is the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in May in the eastern Pacific, said Jeff Masters, meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections and the founder of Weather Underground. He said the region’s hurricanes typically get their start from tropical waves coming off the coast of Africa. “Since the African monsoon typically does not start producing tropical waves until early- or mid-May, there simply aren’t enough initial disturbances to get many eastern Pacific hurricanes in May,” Masters wrote in an email. “In addition, May water temperatures are cooler than they are at the peak of the season, and wind shear is typically higher.” Masters was not sure if Agatha was kicked off by a tropical wave — areas of low pressure that move across the tropics — but the storm has benefitted from warm waters and low wind shear. Late Monday morning, Agatha accelerated slightly, as it moved toward the area near Puerto Escondido and Puerto Angel in the southern state of Oaxaca. The region includes the laid-back tourist resorts of Huatulco, Mazunte and Zipolite. The hurricane center said Agatha could “bring an extremely dangerous storm surge and life-threatening winds.” The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to drop 10 to 16 inches (250 to 400 millimeters) of rain on parts of Oaxaca, with isolated maximums of 20 inches (500 millimeters), posing the threat of flash floods and mudslides. Little change in strength was expected before the storm makes landfall, according to the hurricane center. A hurricane warning was in effect between the port of Salina Cruz and the Lagunas de Chacahua. In Huatulco, municipal authorities cancelled schools and ordered “the absolute closure” of all beaches and its seven bays, many of which are reachable only by boat. The government’s Mexican Turtle Center — a former slaughterhouse turned conservation center in Mazunte — announced it was closed to visitors until further notice because of the hurricane."
13,Why This Small Town In Puerto Rico Should Be Your Next Vacation Spot,environment," Take A Break is your ultimate guide to the perfect trips to recharge, rediscover yourself and your relationships, and reengage with the world. We’ll cover shopping stops, great bars, restaurants worth your money, photo opportunities, memorable drives and experiences, and other important details you need before you book. Below, we chat with HuffPost reporter Sarah Ruiz-Grossman about why you’ll want to put Rincón, Puerto Rico on your bucket list. My college roommate Gabriela Hardy is boricua and lives in Rincón with her partner and daughters. Rincón is a small town on the westernmost tip of Puerto Rico, with intimate, palm-tree-lined beaches, the best sunsets, no big hotels, and lots of taco trucks and restaurants overlooking the water. People especially love to surf there, and it has a laid-back, nature-filled vibe. The best months, in my opinion, are winter ― November through April ― after the hurricane season but before the really hot and humid months of summer. You can count on around 85-degree days, balmy 75-degree nights, a lot of sun, and the occasional tropical shower. The easiest way there is to fly into Aguadilla airport and rent a car, driving the 40 minutes or so to Rincón. In Rincón, it’s pretty necessary to have a car as you don’t have easy-access public transport or rideshares. If you’re planning to stay on the island a week or more, you can fly into San Juan and spend a couple days there before driving the 2.5 hours to Rincón. Rincón doesn’t have massive hotels, which is a big part of its charm. It’s more about boutique hotels and Airbnbs. Tres Sirenas is a gorgeous oceanside bed and breakfast, Fisheye View is a rental up in the hills with a nice pool, and Casa en lo Alto is an Airbnb house with great views and a screened-in porch. Rincón is full of great food ― make sure to get in lots of fish tacos, mofongo and açai bowls. Jack’s Shack is the best spot to grab tacos, Cosecha for vegan-friendly lunch, Cafe 2 Go for iced coffee and açai bowls, and Casa Isleña for sunset dinner with a view. There’s not a huge going-out scene in Rincón, but there are plenty of fun bars to grab drinks at. The Beach House is a bar and grill that overlooks the ocean, La Copa Llena also has great views and a bit of a fancier vibe, Tamboo serves drinks right on the beach, and The English Rose has a hilltop brunch with a mean bloody mary. Rincón has an amazing yoga studio called Centro La Paz that has classes, massages and wellness products. Karibe Kombucha is a must-stop for locally made kombucha and yummy superfood blends to take home and add to your morning coffee. Puntas Surf Shop has great beginner surf lessons with rad bathing suits and water sports gear. Maria’s Beach is the perfect, palm-tree-lined beach with few people around and surfers always in the water ― and it serves up a gorgeous sunset. You should definitely drive the 50 minutes to Gozalandia, which has beautiful wood-planked trails to several waterfalls you can swim in. Domes Beach tends to have bigger waves and a perfect sunset, and if you come in the afternoon, you’re almost guaranteed to see surfers riding the swell — a great place to chill. Survival Beach is a 45-minute drive from Rincón. When you park at Surfer’s Beach in Aguadilla, you can take a 20- to 30-minute trail through the jungle to get to Survival Beach, a long, picturesque beach with small waves and tide pools that you can only get to on foot, almost guaranteeing you’ll have most of the shore to yourself. Goggles! When you swim at the local beaches, like Steps Beach, take time to look down in the water and you’re sure to see colorful fish and even the occasional turtle. People in Rincón are really good about wearing masks in public spaces to protect each other from the COVID-19 virus ― it’s a small town where local residents know each other intimately and interact often, so it’s especially important to respect coronavirus guidelines and get fully vaccinated and boosted before traveling, and to mask up while there. I was surprised by just how laid-back the town is. It’s not big, so you get a handle on the layout and the go-to places within a few days, and it makes for a very relaxed time. Rincón, like much of Puerto Rico, is fighting to keep big developers from buying out waterfront properties on public shorelines that drive up housing prices and make the beaches less accessible to all. Be sure to read up on local activists’ fight to preserve the beaches for all and keep the shorelines from environmental destruction."
14,Inseparable Dog And Pig Pals 'Timon And Pumbaa' Start New Life Together,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A dog and pig should have no worries for the rest of their days after an Arizona animal shelter made sure they found a new home together. Timon, a chihuahua, and Pumbaa, a pig, wound up at the Arizona Humane Society earlier this month after their owner was arrested, the AHS said in a statement sent to HuffPost. The shelter didn’t provide more info on the owner’s arrest, but noted that the charges were unrelated to animal cruelty. It wasn’t long before their deep friendship became apparent to animal shelter staff. “Though it is not always recommended that pigs and dogs live together, this unlikely duo loved to visit each other on occasion during their stay at AHS,” the statement said. “Immediately, AHS staff saw just how strong of a bond these two have, especially when Pumbaa is kind enough to allow Timon to hitch a ride on his back from time to time.” Pumbaa had some medical needs that meant he would need specialized care, so the shelter went about trying to find a pig-centric organization that could take in both creatures. That place turned out to be Better Piggies Rescue, a pig sanctuary in New River, Arizona. While the sanctuary does have pigs up for adoption, it announced this week that Pumbaa and Timon would have a home at the sanctuary permanently ― and that Pumbaa might even have a new job. “He’s a natural greeter,” the sanctuary wrote on Facebook, adding that the gregarious pig would be meeting people when the group resumes public tours in September.

15,3 Women Found Dead At Chicago Senior Living Home Amid Heat Wave,environment," CHICAGO (AP) — Temperatures barely climbed into the 90s and only for a couple of days. But the discovery of the bodies of three women inside a Chicago senior housing facility this month left the city looking for answers to questions that were supposed to be addressed after a longer and hotter heat wave killed more than 700 people nearly three decades ago. Now, the city — and the country — is facing the reality that because of climate change, deadly heat waves can strike just about anywhere, don’t only fall in the height of summer and need not last long. “Hotter and more dangerous heat waves are coming earlier, in May ... and the other thing is we are getting older and more people are living alone,” said Eric Klinenberg, a New York University sociologist, who wrote “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.” about the 1995 heat wave. “It’s a formula for disaster.” The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office has yet to determine the causes of death for the three women whose bodies were found in the James Sneider Apartments on May 14. But the victims’ families have already filed or plan to file wrongful death lawsuits against the companies that own and manage the buildings. The City Council member whose ward includes the neighborhood where the building is located said she experienced stifling temperatures in the complex when she visited, including in one unit where heat sensors hit 102 degrees. “These are senior residents, residents with health conditions (and) they should not be in these conditions,” Alderman Maria Hadden said in a Facebook video shot outside the apartments. Part of the problem, experts say, is that communities nationwide are still learning how deadly heat can be. In Chicago, it took the sight of refrigerated trucks being filled with dead bodies after the 1995 heat wave to drive home the message that the city was woefully unprepared for a silent and invisible disaster that took more than twice as many lives as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. That realization led to a system in which city workers start calling the elderly and frail, and turn city buildings into 24-hour cooling centers when temperatures become oppressive. What happened this month is a reminder that the safeguards in place to make sure people don’t freeze to death because they have not paid their heating bills often do not exist to prevent people from overheating in their homes. “We have nothing for air conditioning,” Hadden said. One expert isn’t surprised. “We recognize people need heating in cold weather and set up programs, financial assistance, to enable that but we don’t do that for cooling,” said Gregory Wellenius, a Boston University professor of environmental health who has studied heat-related deaths. “But subsidies for cooling are really controversial (because) for many people cooling is seen as a luxury item.” In Chicago, Hadden said the building’s management company believed it was not allowed to turn off the heat and turn on the air conditioning until June 1, because of the city’s heat ordinance. But while she said the ordinance has no such requirement, the explanation may at least be a signal that the ordinance should be amended to better protect vulnerable people from heat. Wellenius said statistics show that while well over 80% of homes in cities such as Dallas and Phoenix have air conditioning, the percentage is far lower in cities like Boston and New York. And in the Pacific Northwest, the percentage is even lower, something that came into stark relief in Oregon, Washington and western Canada last June, when temperatures climbed as high as 118 degrees Fahrenheit, killing 600 people or more. There is encouraging news. “More people have air conditioning and we are more aware of the health risks of heat waves,” Klinenberg said. Still, there is evidence that people don’t appreciate or even know just how dangerous the heat can be. In a study published in 2020, Wellenius and other researchers estimated that nationwide about 5,600 deaths a year could be attributed to high heat — eight times more than the 700 heat-related deaths that are study found were officially reported each year. Wellenius said the reasons for what he called a “gross miscalculation” begin with the fact that official statistics are simply the result of counting death certificates that list heat as the cause of death. In the county that includes Chicago, for example, the medical examiner’s office reported two heat-related deaths last year, and seven the year before. Just how many deaths in the U.S. are heat related today is unclear. Wellenius’ study, published in 2020, is the result of research from 1997 to 2006. And Klinenberg said the issue has been complicated by the pandemic. “It’s hard to distinguish excess heat deaths from COVID deaths,” he said. Still, Hadden knows something must be done to deal with heat that can hit earlier and later in the year than it once did. “We have to plan for this,” she said. Klinenberg wonders if cities will follow up on such talk. “Heat never feels like the most important thing in cities and by the time it feels like the most important thing it is too late to do anything about it,” he said."

0,New Mexico's Largest Wildfire Linked To Planned Burns,environment," SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Two fires that merged to create the largest wildfire in New Mexico history have both been traced to planned burns set by U.S. forest managers as preventative measures, federal investigators announced Friday. The findings shift responsibility more squarely toward the U.S. Forest Service for initiating a natural disaster that has destroyed at least 330 homes as flames raged through nearly 500 square miles (1,300 square kilometers) of high-altitude pine forests and meadows. The wildfire also has displaced thousands of residents from rural villages with Spanish-colonial roots and high poverty rates, while unleashing untold environmental damage. Roughly 3,000 firefighters, along with water-dropping planes and helicopters, continue to fight the blaze as it approaches mountain resorts and Native American communities. Firefighting costs already surpass $132 million, climbing by $5 million a day. Fire and law enforcement officials offered a cautious but hopeful Friday night status report, with fire behavior analyst Stewart Turner noting they need to watch the so-called “red flag” conditions — warm, dry weather with high winds — starting Saturday. “The weather is a big concern for us,” Turner acknowledged, saying even an errant pine cone rolling down a slope and crossing a control line could spread flames. “Red flag warning is a big message for tomorrow.” He said dry conditions are expected through Tuesday, but some moisture and even thunderstorms are possible starting Wednesday. Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernández described a rising sense of outrage as the fire triggers new evacuations of families and livestock. Fear of flames is giving way to concern about erosion and mudslides in places were superheated fire penetrates soil and roots. “The destruction these two fires caused is immeasurable and will be felt for generations,” said Leger Fernández, sponsor of a bill that would reimburse residents and businesses routed by the fire. The Forest Service has not yet released detailed planning documents for the original planned burns that might indicate whether fire protocols were followed. Scientist and forest managers are racing to develop new tools to forecast the behavior of planned fires amid climate change and an enduring drought in the American West. The intentionally set blazes, known as prescribed burns, are aimed at limiting the accumulation of timber and underbrush that, if left unattended, can fuel extremely hot and destructive wildfires. The Biden administration announced in January a $50 billion plan to stave off catastrophic wildfires that would more than double the use of planned fires and logging to reduce trees and other vegetation that serve as tinder in the most at-risk areas. Prescribed burns often are used in wildland areas that are too vast to thin by hand or machine. The two fires east of Santa Fe joined in April to form the massive blaze at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains, in the Sangre de Cristo range. One of the fires was previously traced to April 6, when a planned burn, set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush, was declared out of control. On Friday, investigators said they had tracked the source of the second fire to the remnants of a planned winter fire that lay dormant through several snowstorms only to flare up again last month. Investigators said the prescribed “pile burn” was initiated in January at Gallinas Canyon in the Santa Fe National Forest outside Las Vegas, New Mexico, and concluded in the final days of that month. Fire was reported again in the same vicinity April 9 and escaped control 10 days later amid dry, hot and windy conditions, Forest Service investigators found. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement called the investigation results a ""first step toward the federal government taking full responsibility"" for the New Mexico wildfire. She highlighted her pending request to President Joe Biden to direct the Federal Emergency Management Administration to pay for 100% of costs related to a broad range of recovery efforts. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore last week announced a 90-day pause and review of protocols for planned fires that limit the buildup of flammable vegetation. He cited extreme fire danger and unfavorable weather and did not specifically link the review to New Mexico's fires. “It will also ensure the prescribed burn program nationwide is anchored in the most contemporary science, policies, practices and decision-making processes, and that employees, partners and communities have the support they need to continue using this critical tool to confront the wildfire crisis,” the agency said in a statement Friday. Moore said prescribed fires go as planned in more than 99% of cases. Notable exceptions include the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire that swept through national security installations and residential neighborhoods at Los Alamos. So-called pile burns can often include wildland debris collected over months or even years. Forest managers cut back trees and gather debris into mounds, preferring to burn forest fuels in the winter when planned burns are easier to control. In January, Santa Fe National Forest workers started burning through a series of piles across an area of 0.6 square miles (1.5 square kilometers), after advising the public of possible smoke hazards. ___ Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/ Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

1,Elk Calf Named Cinder Rescued From Ashes Of New Mexico Wildfire,environment," SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Firefighters have rescued an abandoned newborn elk calf found amid the ashes of the nation’s largest wildfire as calving season approaches its peak in New Mexico and fires rage across the American West. Missoula, Montana-based firefighter Nate Sink said Tuesday that he happened upon the motionless elk calf on the ground of a fire-blackened New Mexico forest as he patrolled and extinguished lingering hot spots. “The whole area is just surrounded in a thick layer of ash and burned trees. I didn’t think it was alive,” said Sink, who was deployed to the state to help contain a wildfire that by Wednesday had spread across 486 square miles (1,260 square kilometers) and destroyed hundreds of structures. It’s is one of five major uncontained fires burning in New Mexico amid extremely dry and windy conditions. More than 3,000 firefighters battling the biggest blaze have made significant progress halting its growth in recent days ahead of more dangerous fire conditions forecast to return into the weekend, crew commanders said Wednesday night. Wildlife officials in general discourage interactions with elk calves that are briefly left alone in the first weeks of life as their mothers forage at a distance. Sink says he searched diligently for traces of the calf’s mother and found none. The 32-pound (14.5-kilogram) singed bull calf, dubbed “Cinder,” was taken for care to a nearby ranch and is now regaining strength at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Espanola, north of Santa Fe. Veterinarian Kathleen Ramsay at Cottonwood Rehab says she paired Cinder with a full-grown surrogate elk to be raised with as little human contact as possible. “They do elk things, they don’t do people things,” said Ramsay, noting Cinder arrived at a tender days-old age with his umbilical cord still attached. Ramsay said the calf hopefully can be released into the wild in December after elk-hunting season. The strategy has worked repeatedly with elk tracked by tags as they rejoined wild herds. The calf’s rescue was reminiscent of events 70 years ago in New Mexico involving a scalded black bear cub and the fire prevention mascot “Smokey Bear.” The U.S. fire-safety campaign took on new urgency in 1950 with the rescue by firefighters of a black bear cub that was badly burned by wildfire in southern New Mexico. The cub — named Smokey Bear after the mascot — recovered and lived at the National Zoo until its death in 1976. Wildfires have broken out this spring in multiple states in the West, where climate change and an enduring drought are fanning the frequency and intensity of forest and grassland fires. Crews battling the biggest U.S. fire in northern New Mexico took advantage of one last day of favorable weather Wednesday before hotter, drier and windier conditions are forecast to return late Thursday and continue to worsen into next week. “All across the fire, we’re making a lot of really good progress over the last few days,” incident commander Carl Schwope said at a briefing Wednesday night. “We do have some more critical fire weather moving in ... starting now and getting warmer and drier throughout the weekend. (But) feeling real confident that we are ahead of the curve on that,” he said. Bruno Rodriguez, an inter-agency meteorologist assigned to the fire, said gusts should continue to increase by about 5 mph (8 kph) per day, from 25 mph (40 kph) Thursday to as strong as 50 mph (80 kph) by Monday. “It’s definitely going to be a critical fire weather pattern and unfortunately it’s going to be fairly prolonged and persistent,” he said. __ Associated Press writer Scott Sonner contributed to this report from Reno, Nevada."
2,California Considers Banning Declawing Of Cats In Most Cases,environment," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans, advancing a bill on Thursday to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes necessary “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the state Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The bill specifically bans declawing “for a cosmetic or aesthetic purpose or to make the cat more convenient to keep or handle.” The California Veterinary Medical Association says that ignores situations where cat owners are “taking blood thinners, receiving immunosuppression drugs, or other persons whose health would be endangered by a severe scratch.” In a letter to lawmakers, the association wrote that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.” The bill now heads to the state Senate. New York was the first state to ban the procedure in 2019, followed by Maryland earlier this year. This is at least the fourth time California lawmakers have tried to ban declawing since 2018. All of the previous attempts failed. Eight California cities — including Los Angeles and San Francisco — ban declawing. In 2008, California lawmakers passed a law that would have stopped local governments from banning declawing. But the bill never became law because then Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it. Thursday, a majority of lawmakers in the California Assembly appeared eager to ban the procedure statewide. Democratic Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo, the author of the bill, quoted primatologist Jane Goodall in saying that “cruelty is the worst of human sins.” Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee talked about his cat, Soba, saying it would be “heartbreaking to know cats like her would be declawed.” “If a cat has essentially their finger bones taken out, their only defense becomes their teeth,” Lee said. “And having had many loving bites from my cat, I would rather be scratched than bitten by my own cat.”"
3,Chihuahua Puppy In Recovery After Being Shot Through The Neck With Arrow,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A chihuahua puppy in Southern California has survived being shot through her neck with an arrow, after the projectile missed vital arteries. A woman called 911 on Monday saying she’d found the injured puppy in unincorporated Desert Hot Springs after hearing sounds of an animal “screaming,” according to a news release from Riverside County Animal Services. Animal services posted a jarring photo to social media that showed the puppy with the arrow still stuck in her neck. But her injuries weren’t as dire as they appeared. This happened today — and our team saved the dog’s life. Thank you so much to ⁦@RSO⁩ for major assistance! Terrible act! ⁦@RivCoNow⁩ #Chihuahua #veterinarycare #animalcruelty pic.twitter.com/04R5CLgnkU “It was purely a superficial wound,” Ivan Herrera, a veterinary technician who helped treat the puppy, told the Los Angeles Times. With the arrow now safely removed, the chihuahua’s good spirits have returned. “She’s lively, wagging her tail like a puppy and barking for our attention,” Herrera said. Veterinary staff and animal services workers are horrified at the possibility that someone may have shot the small dog on purpose. “She is such a sweet puppy,” veterinary technician Emily Ellison, who is helping with the dog’s treatment, said in the statement from animal services. “I cannot imagine why anyone would do something so terrible to such an innocent creature. It’s very sick.” Animal services is asking anyone with information about what happened to contact them. “For someone to willfully shoot this poor pup with an arrow is disgusting,” director Erin Gettis said in the department’s statement. “We are shocked and we hope someone can provide us any information as to who did this.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what? Others pointed out that innocent people rarely request pardons. Wow. Congressmen helping Trump on & before 1/6 & then demanding pardons. Makes me think of 18 USC 201: A public official who corruptly seeks anything of value in return for an official act or colluding in fraud shall be imprisoned for up to 15 years & disqualified from office Hi Matt. Why did you ask for a pardon?

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Federal Workers Unionize In Wake Of Trump-Era Upheaval,environment," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Federal workers who help oversee hundreds of millions of acres of federal land have formed a union. Headquarters employees of the Bureau of Land Management voted 116 to 20 in favor of joining the National Treasury Employees Union in a ballot count held Wednesday, the union said. The new union would include roughly 200 workers based in Washington and regional offices around the country. Part of the Interior Department, BLM is responsible for managing roughly a third of all federal land, equal to about 10% of the U.S. landmass, the bulk of it in the West. A handful of the agency’s offices already have union representation, but the headquarters group is the largest to unionize to date. The union will include workers who manage BLM programs and budgets, as well as administrative staff. Zoe Davidson, a BLM employee who helped organize the union, said the agency’s employees generally love their jobs, but want a stronger voice when it comes to dealing with Congress and agency leadership. BLM has been understaffed for years, though President Joe Biden has proposed increasing funding so the agency can hire more and fill open roles. “A union really gives you that voice on Capitol Hill,” said Davidson, a botanist based in New Mexico. “Congress puts a lot of pressure on us. We always get these congressional requests… but they never give us a boost in the budget or in permanent employees to do this stuff.” Workers are also hoping to get more job security and prevent any big unilateral changes from leadership. BLM employees were jostled around under the Trump administration, which sought to disperse employees from the D.C. headquarters to western offices, on the grounds that they should be closer to the majority of public lands. Most employees were reluctant to uproot their lives, and the relocation led to nearly 300 people ― the vast majority of affected workers ― resigning or taking early retirement. (Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested attrition was the real goal.) “We're under a very pro-union administration. We would love to build more unions.” Biden’s interior secretary, Deb Haaland, said in September that the agency will restore its Washington headquarters while keeping many workers at a “Western headquarters” in Grand Junction, Colorado. Davidson said many headquarters employees were recently hired and are scattered in offices in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City and elsewhere, and they may not want to move, either. Discussion of unionization preceded all the relocation upheaval, but the episode made clear to many workers that they want a seat at the table with agency leaders, according to Davidson. Workers at her New Mexico BLM office voted to unionize last year with NTEU, which led headquarters employees to reach out to her and her coworkers. Federal workers are eligible to form unions, though they don’t have all the same rights as their private-sector counterparts. They cannot bargain directly over pay or go on strike, but their unions can have a say in the promotion process, scheduling and discipline, and make it harder for agency leadership to make major change without consultation. The Biden White House has promoted collective bargaining as a means for workers to improve their jobs, including those in the federal government. The administration has unwound some of Trump’s attacks on unions in the federal sector, and taken a more diplomatic approach to bargaining. “We’re under a very pro-union administration,” Davidson said. “We have tons of interest coming at us.... We would love to build more unions in the Bureau of Land Management.” Tony Reardon, NTEU’s president, compared the BLM unionization effort to recent successes at employers like Starbucks and Amazon, where workers recently notched historic labor victories. “It should be no surprise that as the labor movement makes new inroads in the private sector, the same would be true for the federal sector, because workers everywhere share the same goal: to be treated with dignity and respect,” Reardon, whose union represents 150,000 workers in 34 federal agencies, said in a statement. BLM employs around 9,000 workers around the country ― roughly 95% of them outside Washington ― but there are an estimated 2,000 vacancies at the agency thanks in part to past federal hiring freezes. Public land advocates say the agency is chronically underfunded and poorly equipped to carry out its mission. A Government Accountability Office report last year said many headquarters positions have been open since 2016, and workers have been pulled off their normal jobs to help fill those duties. Vacancies increased after the Trump administration announced the headquarters move. “We saw what happened without a union,” Davidson said. “We’ll see what a union can do moving forward.” Correction: This story originally misstated the election vote count. The union won 116-20, not 136-20. Labor Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,NOAA Predicts Another Busy Atlantic Hurricane Season,environment," Federal meteorologists are forecasting a record-shattering seventh straight unusually busy Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted Tuesday that the summer in the Atlantic will produce 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to six turbo-charging into major hurricanes with winds greater than 110 mph. Even with normals shifting upwards to reflect more active storm seasons in recent decades, these predictions are above the 30-year average of 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center ran out of names for Atlantic storms in the last two years, with a record-setting 30 named storms in 2020 and 21 last year. In the past five years there have been more Category 4 and 5 hurricane landfalls in the United States than in the previous 50 years combined. This hurricane season “is going to be similar to last year and given that you need only one bad storm to dramatically affect your life, if you fail to plan around this outlook, you’re planning to fail,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told The Associated Press Tuesday. “You can take this outlook to the bank literally when it looks to protecting your property.” Every weather factor pointed to a busier season, said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster for NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. He pointed to a multi-decade long trend to more storms in the Atlantic, an active monsoon season in West Africa, a La Nina — the natural and occasional cooling of parts of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide — and warmer than normal ocean temperatures, which scientists say are stoked by climate change. Several outside hurricane experts agree with NOAA that the Atlantic conditions are ripe for yet another active hurricane season. They say La Nina reduces wind shear that could decapitate storms. The warmer water — about half a degree warmer (0.3 degrees Celsius) than last year in storm-forming areas, according to Rosencrans — serves as hurricane fuel. A reduction in pollution particles in the air has taken away artificial cooling in the Atlantic and a new study links that to increasing storms. Last week President Joe Biden also warned the nation about “another tough hurricane season” coming. “We’re seeing these storms happen more frequently. They’re lasting longer,” FEMA Director Deanne Criswell said in a New York City press conference. NOAA says 13 people in the city died during Hurricane Ida with 11 of them dying in flooded basements. It is also the 10th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, a downgraded hurricane that became one of the most expensive weather disasters in American history with massive flooding in New York. “We’ve seen such a dramatic change in the type of weather events that could be seen as a result of climate change,” Criswell said. Atlantic #HurricaneSeason Outlook 2022: 70% likelihood of 14-21 named storms of which 6-10 could become hurricanes, including 3-6 major hurricanes: https://t.co/a9MLVIUI3I #HurricaneOutlook pic.twitter.com/UpH2uxmjpx NOAA said there’s a 65% chance for an “above-normal” hurricane season, a 25% chance for a normal season and only a one in 10 chance for an unusually quiet season. One key indicator, that takes into account the number of storms, how strong they are and how long they last, is called Accumulated Cyclone Energy index or ACE and Rosencrans said this year could be as much as double what’s been normal since 1950. The calculation is used when determining what is an average season and what’s above average. The average ACE since 1950 is just shy of 100, while the last six years have ranged from 132 to 225 in 2017. That stretch of six straight above-average years is a record, smashing the old mark of three-in-a-row, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher and seasonal forecaster Phil Klotzbach. He said it is highly likely that the record will stretch to seven this year. “It’s really a strange thing that we’ve had six consecutive seasons be so active,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. Did yours make the list? Here are the storm names for the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to the @WMO:  https://t.co/a9MLVIUI3I pic.twitter.com/F3rYv8vntl NOAA’s predictions mesh with ten other meteorological teams — government, university and private — that have made their hurricane season predictions. The average of their predictions is 20 named storms, eight becoming hurricanes and four becoming major hurricanes. Because La Nina has a different effect in the Pacific and conditions usually are opposite, earlier this month NOAA predicted a quieter than normal Pacific storm season. Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations. See more about AP’s climate initiative here.

12,'Most Responsible Kitten In The World' Found Watching Over Orphaned Litter,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost It’s a tough job, but some kitten had to do it. An animal rescue group in Kansas City, Missouri, pronounced a 6-week-old black cat the “most responsible kitten in the world” after he was found watching over three younger kittens whose mother was nowhere to be found. “Meet the most responsible kitten in the world,” wrote the KC Pet Project on Facebook last week alongside a photo of the fuzzy quartet. The nonprofit added that “the person who found them told us that he’s been taking care of babies, and we think this is about the cutest thing ever.” The person who spotted the four felines outside first waited to see if a mother cat showed up. When no mother materialized, the individual “brought them to the shelter together,” KC Pet Project spokesperson Tori Fugate told HuffPost in an email. Very young kittens need milk from a mother cat ― or must be bottle-fed by human caretakers ― to survive. But the older kitten, who has since been named Binx, appeared nevertheless to be looking out for the “little ones” and trying to care for them “as best he could,” Fugate said. The three younger kittens, estimated to be about 2 weeks old, are all male and have been named Ollie, Frankie and Ziggy. It’s unknown what happened to the mother. But all four kittens are “doing great so far,” Fugate said, and are in the care of a foster home, where the youngest ones are being bottle-fed every few hours. Binx is still with them. “They all went to a foster home together,” she said, “because how could we split them up?” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
13,Rodeo Bull Jumps Arena Fence And Charges Through VIP Section,environment," REDDING, Calif. — Several people were injured when a bull jumped a fence and escaped an arena during a popular Northern California rodeo, authorities said. (Watch the video below.) The escape occurred Friday during the final section of the Redding Rodeo’s bull riding event, the Redding Rodeo Association said on Facebook. The bull leapt over a fence then ran through a crowd of spectators and across a parking lot before it was captured near a bridge about a half mile from the arena. At least six people were treated for minor injuries, including 15-year-old Jordan Greco, a sophomore at Redding’s Enterprise High School. Greco told the Redding Record Searchlight the bull’s horn’s clipped his leg as the animal charged through the arena’s VIP section. “Getting hit by a bull was an experience,” Greco said. “To be honest I didn’t feel it at the time because my adrenaline was pumping and I had to make split-second decisions.” At least one person was hurt near the Sundial Bridge, where the animal was finally caught, placed in a trailer and returned to its ranch, Redding police Cpl. Aaron Holleman said. “We wish the best to all those affected. The safety of our fans is our highest priority and we appreciate their support,” the Redding Rodeo Association’s statement said. The incident occurred on the third day of the four-day annual rodeo."
14,The U.S. Is Addicted To Gas Heating. A New Bill May Make Going Electric The Easy Choice.,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost When it’s cold outside, most American homes burn gas or fuel for warmth ― a big part of why buildings are the country’s fourth-largest source of climate-changing emissions. When it’s hot, an even bigger percentage of households switch on electric air conditioners. Heat pumps ― essentially two-way air conditioners ― can do both, warming homes without spewing fossil fuel pollution into the air. But buying and installing these machines generally costs more than air conditioners, government incentives to offset prices vary by state and many people simply haven’t heard of a heat pump. A new bill set to be announced in the Senate this week aims make heat pumps more popular by boosting domestic production, giving manufacturers tax credits of between $600 and $1,000 per machine. While far more limited than policies in some European countries, the proposed federal handout is meant to drive down prices in line with home cooling systems and spurring companies to market and sell more of the appliances in lieu of traditional air conditioners. If heat pumps become the standard cooling appliances in a country where 66% of households have central air conditioning, then why double up on heating by installing a fossil-fueled furnace or boiler, too? “This legislation is a win-win ― reducing energy costs for consumers, while strengthening access to clean, energy-efficient heating solutions,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the bill’s lead author, said in a statement. Heat pumps transfer rather than generate heat. While an air conditioner absorbs heat from inside the building and moves it outside, a heat pump absorbs heat from outside and moves it inside. This works by circulating a refrigerant through an evaporator and condenser. For every 1 kilowatt hour of electricity a heat pump uses, it produces 2 to 4 kilowatt hours of heat energy, making it up to four times more efficient than a regular boiler or furnace, according to Carbon Switch, a service that provides detailed guides on climate-friendly appliances. The Department of Energy found that heat pumps use roughly half as much power as traditional electric systems like space heaters or baseboard heaters. “There’s very little difference from a hardware perspective between a one-way air conditioner and a two-way heat pump,” said Kevin Kircher, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who researches heat pumps. The bill, he said, is calibrated to make up the difference in hardware costs on the assembly line, making it cheaper to just manufacture two-way heat pumps instead of air conditioners. “The big picture is that heat pumps today, in a lot of markets, are substantially more expensive than a gas furnace,” Kircher said. “This isn’t so much to make heat pumps cheaper than incumbent options but to make heat pumps more prevalent.” But the efficiency of electric heating makes it less sensitive on average to price spikes from shocks in the fossil fuel markets even though most of the U.S. grid is still powered with gas and coal. A study last fall by the federal Energy Information Administration found that U.S. households heating primarily with natural gas would spend at least 30% more than the last winter’s average. Homes with oil heating were on track to spend at least 43% more. Propane users faced a 54% spike. By contrast, households heating primarily with electricity were looking at a 6% cost increase last winter. Once the U.S. generates the vast majority of its electricity from non-fossil sources, heating prices would be even steadier. Heat pumps aren’t a perfect climate fix. While undoubtedly less damaging than burning gas or oil, the refrigerants used in heat pumps and air conditioners are potent greenhouse gases when leaked into their atmosphere. New international standards agreed to last month will set the stage for more climate-friendly chemicals, but the U.S. could be slow to adopt the cleanest coolants. Some 12 million U.S. households already use heat pumps. The appliances are primarily deployed in the South, where nearly one-fifth of homes have heat pumps, and out West. Those regions tend to be hotter and saw the biggest increase in new housing construction over the past decade, making new technologies that provide both cooling and heat a more obvious choice. Heat pumps have historically tended to be less efficient in extreme cold, when there’s just less warm air to pull from outside. But the technology has improved significantly over the past decade. Colder states in the Northeast, which still relies heavily on oil for heating, are now seeing a double-digit rate of growth in heat pump adoption, compared to single-digit rises in the West, South and Midwest, according to a report from the Atlas Building Hub. State-level subsidies are helping. Massachusetts offers rebates of up to $10,000 off heat pump systems. New York’s rebates can top $7,500. Maine’s are up to $1,200. “To really drive a transformation you need the carrot and the stick.” Klobuchar’s bill marks a first step toward making heat pumps more of a national priority, said Parth Vaishnav, an assistant professor of sustainable systems at the University of Michigan, who called it “a start, a carrot.” “But to really drive a transformation you need the carrot and the stick,” he said. Since Berkeley, California, became the first U.S. city to prohibit new gas hookups, dozens have followed, with New York City becoming the largest to pass a ban last winter. No state has yet banned gas, though New York recently considered following its eponymous city. But nearly two dozen states, primarily led by Republicans, have passed laws barring cities from banning gas. Europe offers a stark comparison. The Swiss city of Zurich voted to ban gas heating in November and eliminate the need for households to pick a single source by instead building a municipally-owned district heating system that would distribute warmth from a central location much like electricity is transmitted from a power plant. That model for heating is already popular in cold Nordic nations. The United Kingdom is moving ahead with a ban on gas boilers, at least in England, and offering grants to households totaling nearly $6,300. Germany set a rule requiring all new heating systems installed after 2025 to run primarily on renewable energy. This month, the Netherlands ― once Europe’s top gas producer ― announced plans to ban new gas-only heating by 2026 and make heat pumps mandatory in most buildings. Such mandates would be challenging to enact in the U.S., where an entrenched fossil fuel industry and a federalized system of government have made overhauling energy use difficult. Building codes here are set at the state level but follow a generic set of measures drafted and updated every three years by the International Code Council, a nonprofit consortium of industry groups and state and city government officials. While governments have in recent years pushed for codes that mandate more electrification of new buildings, industry groups ― including trade associations of gas utilities ― have fought back. Last year, those groups succeeded in curbing the power governments have over what makes it into the final set of generic U.S. building codes. Legislation outright banning gas or oil would also be unlikely to pass in the U.S. Senate, where most Republicans and a number of prominent Democrats remain staunchly opposed to policies that explicitly shut out fossil fuel businesses. Klobuchar’s legislation has six Democrats signed on ― Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The bill includes provisions supporting organized labor, promising to increase applicable tax credits by 10% for heat pumps made in unionized factories. If more conservative lawmakers like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) approved, the bill could be passed as part of a reconciliation bill, a Senate process that allows Democrats to use their narrow 50-vote majority to enact law. But tax credits for companies producing clean-energy products have generally been popular with both Democrats and Republicans, meaning the legislation could ultimately pass through traditional means with some kind of bipartisan majority. The Senate voted 86-11 to pass a $40 million aid package to help Ukraine fight Russia with U.S. weapons. As Europeans scrambling to replace Russian gas supplies, the U.S. is angling to sell the continent more liquefied natural gas. The new Senate bill proposes another option. “To cut emissions, we need to green home heating. To squeeze Putin, we need Europeans to stop using Russian natural gas,” Hickenlooper said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “By spurring U.S. heat pump manufacturing we can lower emissions, cut European dependence on Russia and create jobs at home.” CORRECTION: This story has been amended to account for an error in Klobuchar’s press release that attributed Hickenlooper’s quote to her.

15,News Leak: Dolphins Recognize Each Other By Tasting One Another's Urine,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost It’s a whiz of a discovery: Dolphins recognize one another by the taste of their urine. New research suggests that the ocean mammals have a unique sense of taste that allows them to sense friends and family members through pee and other excretions. According to the study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers had a singular porpoise, er, purpose: to see how the sea creatures reacted to urine samples from different individuals. Turns out, dolphins were more likely to show interest in urine collected from animals they knew rather than randos. “Dolphins explored urine samples for longer if they came from known animals or when they were presented together with the dolphin’s unique and distinctive signature whistle, an acoustic identifier that works like a name,” professor Vincent Janik, director of the Scottish Oceans Institute and lead author of the study, told the Guardian. Researchers employed the services of bottlenose dolphins who swim with tourists at the Dolphin Quest resorts in Hawaii and Bermuda. Fellow researcher Jason Bruck, a marine biologist at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas, told National Geographic the original goal was to test whether dolphins use their signature whistles in the same way people rely on names. Bruck couldn’t do that unless he found a second way dolphins could identify each other. Luckily, he remembered that a fellow scientist had previously observed wild dolphins swimming through what the website called “plumes of urine” and he figured the creatures might be using it as an ID technique. “It was a shot in the dark,” Bruck said. “And I was not expecting it to work, to be honest.” But it did. Dolphins don’t have a sense of smell, so the way they would identify each other went like this: When one dolphin peed or pooped, the others would swim through the excretions with their mouths to get a big taste of their friend, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Company. “In other animals, it’s very difficult to separate the sense of smell from the sense of taste. So this is a really exciting opportunity to just study how taste works in this really unique way,” Bruck told the network. The researchers noticed the participating dolphins spent three times longer analyzing urine they recognized than pee from strangers. Bruck also noticed the dolphins seemed to be as fascinated with the experiment as he was. “The dolphins were very, very keen to participate,” Bruck told National Geographic. “Usually, dolphins get bored with my experiments. We were tapping into something that is part of the dolphins’ world.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

0,The War Over 'White Gold' In North Carolina,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost This story was published in collaboration with The Assembly, a digital magazine about the people, institutions and ideas that shape North Carolina. GASTON COUNTY, North Carolina — Brian Harper opened the door to his back porch, stepped outside, and inhaled the brisk air. Exhaling, he stretched his arms out wide as if to embrace the bucolic scene before him. Moments like this were sacred — and, he feared, fleeting. On that late afternoon in early January, the sun cast a golden tint over the brown frost-nipped fields behind the Harper family’s stately brick home. Just a few hundred feet away was the red barn containing his workshop, where he makes precision gears for clients like Duracell, Dart Container Corp. and Nestlé. Harper, 54, wanted to catch the last bit of light on his quiet stretch of farmland about 45 minutes northwest of Charlotte. He crunched onto his icy lawn and cut a diagonal path across his neatly mowed 12 acres. Past the neighboring home where his sister-in-law and her family live and down a gentle slope, he came to a stop on the squishy banks of a brook. He crouched down and pointed to a small mound of mud — a crayfish burrow. Before long, Harper said, a herd of deer would make its nightly visit to drink and munch on greenery the recent cold snap hadn’t yet claimed. “This, to me, is paradise,” Harper said. “And all this, when they start mining, will disappear.” Beneath these rolling hills lies what many investors now call “white gold.” And just beyond Harper’s tree line, the mining startup Piedmont Lithium wants to dig up to four 500-foot-deep pits to pull out the lithium reserves that once made Gaston County the world’s top source of the soft metal now used to make batteries for cellphones and electric vehicles. If permits and local zoning changes clear the way for the project, Piedmont could begin digging as early as next year, making this likely the first major new supply of American lithium since demand started surging over the past two years. The mine has become an unlikely microcosm of a clean-energy conflict starting to take center stage in the debate over how to avert catastrophic global warming. To preserve a planet with hospitable weather patterns resembling what we see today, the world needs to rapidly phase out oil, gas and coal. But quitting fossil fuels means dramatically increasing the supply of minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt that make it possible to do with electricity what today requires igniting liquid carbon. And in places from Chile to Serbia, Nevada to now North Carolina, the clashes erupting between mining companies and the people who live near resource deposits are increasingly known as “lithium wars” and could dictate how that transition happens. Few places in the U.S. better exemplify the demand for battery metals than the American South, where the power grid is especially dirty, the lack of public transit makes personal automobiles necessary, and labor laws that are unfavorable to unions have helped attract car factories. Last December, Toyota unveiled plans for a $1.3 billion battery plant in Greensboro, North Carolina. In March, Vietnamese electric-car maker VinFast announced it would build its first U.S. plant in North Carolina. This week, Hyundai confirmed Savannah, Georgia, as the site of its next big electric vehicle factory. The South Korean battery behemoth SK Innovation was already building its manufacturing hub in northern Georgia to supply lithium packs to the Tennessee factories building Ford’s electric F-150 and Volkswagen’s signature crossover models. Beneath the soybean fields, pine stands and trickling streams of this county is a uniquely pure vein of minerals containing the most valued type of lithium on the market today. The price of the metal overall surged nearly 500% between 2021 and 2022, with forecasts showing demand is set to increase fourfold by the end of the decade. Lithium hydroxide, the type of finished product Piedmont would sell, sold in mid-May for as much as $72,000 per metric ton — a 127% increase since the start of the year. But as the Biden administration and lawmakers from both parties push to ramp up domestic mining and processing in hopes of breaking China’s near-monopoly on the metal, local opposition is mounting. In Nevada, Native American tribes, ranchers and environmentalists complain that a big proposed lithium mine in the desert threatens to desecrate sacred land, deplete a drought-dried water table, and kill off rare plant species. In California, plans to extract lithium from the inland Salton Sea have stoked concerns over air pollution and toxic contaminants. Projects to mine copper, nickel and rare earth minerals — all critical ingredients to a post-fossil future — have faced similar complaints across Western states. With the roughly 3,200 acres of land it now controls, Piedmont vowed to make this county — which in the 1950s was the epicenter of global lithium production — the home of “the world’s most sustainable lithium project.” The company is spending millions on infrastructure and equipment that it said will set a new standard for reducing air pollution and noise from a mine of any kind. It has pledged to treat and recycle water, help neighbors whose water wells run dry as a result of the mining, and pay local employees salaries about 50% higher than the county average. “You couldn’t possibly design our project in a more environmentally friendly way — our team is smart, experienced and cognizant of what the rules are,” said Keith Phillips, 62, Piedmont’s chief executive and a former mining banker on Wall Street. “We think it’s the best lithium asset on the planet, and we think the community should be inordinately proud of it.” But that sales pitch is falling flat with many residents here, who fear the mine dooms a community with families who trace their roots back centuries. Unlike projects out West, which are largely located on sparsely populated tracts owned by the state or federal governments, Gaston County has more than 610 people per square mile — nearly seven times the average U.S. population density. There’s no municipal water supply, and the mine will draw millions of gallons from the same water table that replenishes local wells and streams. Residents here worry about pollution: Small-scale mining from decades ago left behind toxic waste. And in a county close to one of the nation’s fastest-growing financial capitals, property owners wince at how much value their land could lose if there’s a mine practically in their backyard. Piedmont, by its own admission, has been slow to reach out to the community, many of whose members now see the company’s executives as opportunistic carpetbaggers. In a place where children bear surnames etched on gravestones older than the United States itself, many residents worry the horizon for any benefits from the project is short. If mining lasts only 30 years, as company statements have suggested, or alternative battery chemistries make lithium-ion packs obsolete, they fear their sacrifices will have only enriched Piedmont’s shareholders. Now a coalition of those neighbors wants to stop the project in its tracks. For months now, signs calling for Piedmont to leave have fluttered up and down the country roads that crisscross the county. Fearing state and federal mining rules are stacked in favor of permitting the project, these locals have focused on what they see as the most vulnerable chokepoint: persuading the Gaston County Board of Commissioners to reject Piedmont’s bid to rezone the area from agricultural to industrial use. At public hearings so far, these opponents of the mine outnumbered supporters. Both sides of the feud see it as an existential fight. If wells dry up, if contaminants make it less safe to live here, or if the wildlife and landscapes that define the area disappear, many lament the possibility of becoming the final generation of their families to call this place home. But others worry that if a state-of-the-art mine can’t move forward in a place with a history of lithium production at a time when political and market demand is this high, then the chances of seriously slashing fossil fuel use in the world’s largest economy look slim. “Right now, the battery plants that are there in the U.S. are dependent on imports,” said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at the British-based battery supply chain research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “Having a domestic, secure supply of lithium is critical. And obviously Piedmont is one of those projects.” Long before there was a Gaston County or a United States — hundreds of millions of years ago — the tectonic plates beneath northern Africa and North America collided, forming the Appalachian Mountains. Molten magma oozed into cracks in the Earth’s crust and formed veins of igneous rock geologists call pegmatite containing a mineral named spodumene, the ore that is processed into lithium. The deposit, known as the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt, is one of the oldest and most economically important formations of its kind in North America. The belt is roughly 25 miles long, snaking northeast from the South Carolina border to Lincolnton, North Carolina. The thickest portion, barely 2 miles wide, is in Gaston County, where outcroppings of the yellowish, flaky mineral are abundant enough that you can pluck samples from boulders in the woods. It’s hard to tell from today’s quiet, rural landscape, but this area was the cradle of the lithium industry throughout the mid-20th century. Small mines along the belt supplied most of the world’s lithium, then primarily used for pharmaceuticals and, later, in nuclear weapons. Demand for the commodity grew quickly after World War II as industry and Cold War arms makers alike increased their appetites. Some mom-and-pop miners even dug trenches in their backyards and sold ore to the federal government. In 1939, the value of lithium mined in the U.S. came out to a little over $500,000 annually, according to inflation-adjusted data from a 1955 U.S. Geological Survey report. By 1953, that output was worth more than $21 million. The next two decades were the heyday of Gaston County’s lithium boom. And it was, quite literally, a boom. Back in the 1970s, when miners set off dynamite to break up rocks at the now-defunct Hallman-Beam lithium mine in Bessemer City, the windows would rattle in Dean Crocker’s home. “Those blasts could be heard for miles and miles,” said Crocker, now in his 80s, a cattle farmer whose family has lived in Gaston County for seven generations. At peak capacity, Piedmont could set off multiple explosions per day as it mines deeper into the ground. That might be an irritation for Crocker and others. But Harper, who runs Stine Gear & Machine Co. from his barn, said even a single routine blast would make it impossible for him to run his business, which relies on highly sensitive machines calibrated to carve precise grooves into metal cogs. The number of explosions will depend on where the miners are in the ore body, Phillips said, noting that local ordinances would bar Piedmont from blasting “when it’s dark, weekends or holidays.” He insisted the company has every incentive to blast as little as possible because it’s a difficult and time-consuming process. “Ideally you blast just enough so the team can move it from the processing area,” the chief executive said. “The fewer times you blast, the better off everybody is.” Harper said he met with Piedmont representatives and told them it would cost about $250,000 to move all his equipment to a new location, and asked what they could offer him to help. The company never responded, he said. “That’s completely inaccurate,” Phillips said. “To be crystal clear: A man with a machine shop who needs a quarter-million dollars, do you think we’re going to let him stand in the way? If he needs a quarter-million dollars, we’ll find him a quarter-million dollars. That’s the world’s easiest answer. But we want to really understand it. We’re actually not convinced it’s true that anything we do will have any impact on what he’s doing.” The lithium industry’s legacy in the region is one of the stronger arguments in favor of starting a new chapter. After all, it never fully went away. In the 1980s, the Hallman-Beam and other mines closed down as lithium production shifted overseas, where more lax rules made it cheaper to extract. Australia became a top producer, particularly of lithium extracted via hard-rock mining. South America — Chile and Argentina, in particular — emerged as major sources of lithium produced by a process known as brining, where miners flood pools of water in the desert and collect the metals that remain after evaporation. Little by little, China came to dominate the supply chain: By 2020, it became a top-four supplier of raw materials, the No. 1 refiner of processed lithium, the No. 1 manufacturer of lithium batteries and components, and the No. 1 market demanding more lithium, according to a ranking from the energy consultancy BloombergNEF. In 2021, a newer version of BloombergNEF’s report that laid out its findings in slightly different categories ranked China No. 1 in battery raw materials, manufacturing and demand. The U.S., by contrast, ranked 15th in lithium production in 2020, despite coming in second for market demand, and came in 11th last year for raw materials. That the U.S. placed in the top 20 at all owes on some level to the legacy industry that remains here in North Carolina’s Piedmont region. Albemarle Corp., one of the largest lithium mining companies in the world, is still headquartered in Charlotte. In March, the firm began holding public meetings about restarting production at a shuttered lithium mine in Kings Mountain, just south of Gaston County. Livent Corp., the modern spinoff of the mining company that once owned the Hallman-Beam mine, still operates a lithium refining business in Bessemer City, where in 2019 it said it would spend $18 million to increase its output of the metal. A spokesman for Livent said the company stopped all hard-rock mining in North Carolina in 1996 and sold Hallman-Beam in 1998. Today the site is located next to a quarry owned by Martin Marietta Materials. A spokeswoman for the Raleigh-based building materials seller did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One scar the mine left behind was an artificial pond so polluted with arsenic that two neighbors separately relayed stories of watching birds land there only to die shortly afterward. Arsenic occurs naturally along the spodumene belt, and state regulators have long considered Gaston County a “hot spot” for contamination. Chronic exposure to arsenic causes diarrhea and stomach cramping in the short term and increases the risk of cancer over time. While I could not find any studies or reports that independently verified locals’ claims about avian deaths, federal studies have documented the deadly effect arsenic has on animals, and examples abound of migratory birds dying after landing in arsenic-contaminated ponds. The Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, a local environmental group focused on the region’s water systems, said modern mining techniques generally produce fewer tailings, or leftover materials, than in the 1950s, so the risk of similar arsenic contamination from Piedmont’s project is lower. But the county’s natural waterways could suffer, the nonprofit said. Last November, the Catawba Riverkeeper joined researchers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in conducting a survey of the area that discovered two new species of crayfish. The researchers asked Piedmont for permission to survey some of the land the company owns. The firm had no legal obligation to comply and declined, said Brandon Jones, the Riverkeeper’s chief scientist. (Phillips said he did not recall that conversation.) “There’s actually much more diversity and we’re just starting to tell the different crayfish apart,” Jones said. “We’re certainly concerned about losing some of those species.” Stirring up arsenic is the least of many residents’ worries. Most of the ore Piedmont plans to dig is below the water table, meaning as the company excavates, water will flood in and it will need to be pumped out. The firm said in regulatory filings that it would pull between 860,000 gallons and 1.1 million gallons of water from the ground per day at peak capacity. “This is certainly going to be dropping the water table, and it will certainly be impacting wells,” Jones said. Piedmont acknowledged in filings that its mining may lower the water table, which is uniquely close to the surface. Abundant streams like the one on Harper’s property are one visible effect of that geological reality. Another unseen one is how shallow some residents here have dug their wells. Some household wells, one resident said, go down only 30 feet. More common, though, are wells dug 300 feet deep. “We don’t think we’re going to impact anybody directly,” Phillips said. “If we do, we’ll be happy to remediate it.” In a state permit application, Piedmont suggested that it would drill new wells for homeowners at its own discretion if its experts determined that mining operations were responsible for a well going dry. As a secondary solution, the company said it would pay to connect homeowners to a municipal water source. That could prove tricky, since the area around the proposed mine is not currently piped for that, and the nearest municipal supply has, in the past, struggled to service its existing customer base in times of drought. It may not be a popular option, either: Households on wells do not pay for water, and the company said in the application that it would not pay people’s water bills once they’re hooked up to a municipal supply. Piedmont said it “may also” supply neighbors who lose their wells with water tanks and short-term deliveries that “meet the minimum water volume used or needed by the resident prior to the groundwater level decline.” If all else fails, the company said it will “negotiate in good faith” to buy the property. “We know that there’s different depths of where some of the aquifers are. Everybody thinks you drill a hole in the ground, and there’s one big lake under here. It’s not like that,” David Klanecky, then Piedmont’s chief operating officer, told me during an hourlong drive around Gaston County in January. “There are all these different pockets. We’ve done all these different water studies with hydrogeologists out here. There may be some impacts.” (Klanecky and another executive who gave me a tour around Piedmont’s properties, vice president of corporate communications Brian Risinger, have since left the company. Phillips said Klanecky took a job as chief executive of a battery recycling firm, but remains a “technical adviser and close friend” of Piedmont. He said Risinger “left on his own accord.”) Piedmont’s opponents, Klanecky said, think “we’re going to drain all the water in Gaston County and this is going to be a desert in five years. That’s probably not going to happen, right? So, we can talk through this with people.” “The truth is, nobody knows how it will affect our water system,” said Bob Lancaster, 71, a retiree who relies on well water and lives just north of the county. “But once you ring the bell, you can’t unring it.” On a cold night in January, I met Dan Setzer, 58, at his tidy one-story home near the proposed mine. While we discussed the possibility of relying on bottled water, he hurried to the kitchen sink to fill me a glass. It tasted crisp and mineraly, distinct from the highly treated but prized tap water in New York City, where I’m from. “We’ve got springs and creeks that are some of the nicest around,” the upholstery manufacturing worker said. He just didn’t believe Piedmont’s promises to ultimately restore whatever land it tarnishes with its operation. “They’ll never put that back. … This is just a money grab to them.” Locke Bell, a retired former district attorney who lives with his wife on a sprawling property dense with woodlands and gardens, suspected the company didn’t even have a full picture of which wells its project would affect. He has three operating wells on his land. A map Piedmont submitted in public documents last year showed just one, he said. “I’ve got four creeks, too, and three of them will be dry if they mine,” Bell said, puffing on a cigar on his back porch. “Everybody else, and all the wildlife that lives off these things, it’ll all be gone.” The Catawba Riverkeeper also worries about runoff pollution in the surface streams. Right now, Piedmont is proposing 30-foot setbacks — or undisturbed buffer zones between the mine and streams, which is the requirement under North Carolina law. “We’d prefer 100-foot setbacks,” Jones said. “That’s the gold standard for the industry.” The company would, in fact, have a “different setback for different things,” Phillips said, adding that for “our pits, we’re expecting [the setback] to be 100 feet.” Piedmont Lithium got its start six years ago, when Taso Arima, an Australian investor who works on mining startups, joined forces with Lamont Leatherman, a geologist who grew up in Lincolnton, near the end of the Tin-Spodumene Belt. Canadian-born Phillips, who previously worked at JPMorgan Chase, joined a year later. In September 2016, the company secured the rights to buy at least five separate tracts of land in Gaston County, according to property records. By the end of 2017, it added at least nine more and registered at least one separate shell company to make land deals in North Carolina. At first, the company planned to mine in Gaston County but build its chemical processing plant near Kings Mountain, just south of the area. But the firm ultimately acquired land adjacent to its mining tracts that it deemed suitable for the facility, and changed its plans to consolidate everything in one area. Piedmont inked its first major deal in September 2020, to supply electric auto giant Tesla with one-third of the mine’s annual output of unprocessed spodumene for five years. Last year, Piedmont, which had until then been headquartered in Australia, officially “redomiciled” in Belmont, North Carolina, roughly 30 minutes away from the proposed mine, on the opposite side of Gaston County. It also currently occupies a small field office closer to the site. As of last October, the company controlled approximately 3,245 acres, of which 1,526 acres were claims on private property through option or deferred purchase agreements, 113 acres were under long-term mineral leasing deals, 79 acres were under lease-to-own contracts, and 1,527 acres were owned by Piedmont outright, according to figures in a feasibility study it published. That, the firm said, is more than enough to begin its work, though it claims on its website to be “actively and aggressively adding further options to considerably expand our presence in the region.” “We want to continue to acquire property here, because we think there’s more development opportunity,” Klanecky said. “Realistically, this could be double the size of what we’ve announced today if we continue to acquire more land. We know there’s spodumene on the belt, and we know there’s lithium.” The main obstacle, he said, were landowners who refused to sell their property, or asked the company to pay 10 times what the firm believed the parcel was worth — which Piedmont considered exorbitant. Once the company has mining permits, Klanecky said, that will serve as a “trigger event” where holdouts will lose hope of stopping the mine and instead see the project as inevitable. “Once the state mining permits have been issued, that’ll be another trigger event. People will say, ‘They’re going to mine here, so let’s let them buy the property,’” Klanecky said. “We’re being patient. We’ve done a lot of really good deals with owners. I think we’ve paid them very well.” Asked if Piedmont’s generosity may be more limited if a landowner has a change of heart once mining begins, he said: “If it’s a relationship where it’s contentious, then they’ve got to understand the risk of not doing something. We try to point that out.” Perceptions of bad faith cut both ways. Crocker said he suspected Piedmont “thought Gaston County was an ignorant county, and they thought they could hoodwink us.” Harper said his first impression of the company was “gentlemen coming down from New York, thinking we were dumb hicks.” Even newer residents felt the company’s representatives had talked down to them. LeAnne Pembleton, a 64-year-old clinical health researcher who relocated here from Atlanta in 2015 with her husband, Rich, said: “My impression is they feel they’re dealing with a bunch of hillbillies. They acted so hoity-toity.” Klanecky conceded that “there’s some people who truly have an emotional connection,” not just property owners playing hardball. “Their grandfather grew up here. Their whole family lived here forever, and it’s hard to see their property sold or their neighbor’s property sold and be potentially impacted by that. That’s why we’re trying to minimize the impact to the people who can still live here,” Klanecky said. “Those are the hard conversations.” I asked Risinger, the spokesman at the time of my trip, if Piedmont could provide names or numbers for some of the 150 or so landowners who made deals to sell the company their property. He initially said yes, but did not respond to follow-up requests. At least half a dozen residents in Gaston County told me their neighbors had signed nondisclosure agreements with the firm. But what the firm called “trigger events,” Pembleton saw as bullying. “Some people feel they don’t have any choice,” she said at her dinner table one night. “A lot of them were snookered into signing the contracts.” If approved, the project would be a massive undertaking, dwarfing past mining and chemical operations in the county. The mining would start by digging a 500-foot-deep open pit. The miners will bore into the rock, load the holes with dynamite, and clear the area before blasting it apart. Workers would then sort through the remains and use machines to crush boulders into smaller rocks. Normally, at that point, a mining company would fill diesel trucks with excavated materials and drive them to a processing facility. But Piedmont plans to spend over $50 million on an electric-powered covered conveyor system that will snake thousands of feet from the dig site to the neighboring chemical plant. Another, smaller facility on the site will gather other rocks of value such as quartz and feldspar, which the company plans to sell for construction materials. Rocks and dirt without value will end up in a pile more than 21 stories high. At the chemical plant, the spodumene rocks will be roasted at lava-hot temperatures, cooled, crushed and cooked in sulfuric acid, which converts the spodumene from its alpha to beta form, a necessary prerequisite to refining it into lithium hydroxide. The mining operations and sorting plants will be powered completely with solar electricity, but the chemical plant will use natural gas. Despite the natural gas required — it’s difficult to reach the temperatures needed for processing without fossil fuels — Piedmont claims its lithium will be among the cheapest and cleanest in the world because of its local supply chain. Most lithium on today’s market is either mined similarly in Australia and then shipped to China for processing, or produced using the brining method in Chile and Argentina. Much of that, too, typically gets shipped to China for processing. The processed materials then go to battery manufacturers in China, Europe, South Korea or the U.S., where automakers are increasingly sourcing their electric vehicle components. “We think our project is, from an environmental perspective, going to be a world leader, located in an area where it can be closer to important customers, car companies and battery companies,” Phillips said. At some point in the next decade, Piedmont plans to dig a second pit, also as deep as the length of two football fields. Once it exhausts the first mine, it will dig a third and backfill the first, then repeat that process again with a fourth pit. Phillips declined to give a timeline for digging all four holes. The plan is to eventually leave the final pit open as a quarry. “You build one, mine one, then mine another and backfill the waste rock,” he said. Despite years of buying up properties and studying the mining potential of the area, Piedmont did not approach the Gaston County Board of Commissioners until April 2020. Phillips said mining projects take years to fully conceive, and a local adviser had told him to wait until the company had finalized its proposal to avoid any kind of confusion over Piedmont’s plans in the county. The firm only made its first public appearance at a hearing last July. It wasn’t exactly a warm welcome. Four of the seven commissioners expressed anger that this was the first time a company with such ambitious plans in the county was coming before the body that would ultimately decide its fate. Commission Chairman Chad Brown called the proposal “the worst rollout of a project from a company I’ve ever seen” in a Reuters interview before the hearing. From behind his wooden dais, he complained at the hearing that Piedmont’s marketing materials included the county government’s trademarked logo, giving the appearance that the officials had already rubber-stamped the proposal. When constituents asked about the proposed mine, Brown said he was made to look foolish because the company had not yet engaged with the commission. “I find it very damaging to me to have to tell these people that I don’t know anything about it,” Brown said. “It’s very frustrating.” During a portion in which constituents lined up to speak, Tim Hepler, a truck driver, said he tried selling his house, but had to take it off the market because no buyers wanted to be near a likely pit mine. “Houses are selling for $30 to $50 less per square foot that are going to be near what a lot of people are saying is the big hole in the ground that’s proposed, and near a chemical plant,” he said. “The Piedmont Lithium people, are they going to live near this big hole in the ground and near this chemical plant? That’s a real big question that needs to be asked of them.” Harper warned that the project would destroy his livelihood. “What is happening here may make other people’s dreams,” he said, his voice quivering with emotion. “But mine is going away.” A handful of residents expressed support for the proposal. Kevin Gee said he recently moved to the area and urged a farming community concerned over pollution to take stock of how much pesticide and chemical fertilizer was already used here. “Change is abrasive. It’s hard. I get it … [but] any objection anyone has to this project I can overcome in five minutes,” he said. “I’m a dreamer, and I see the potential of a project like this, so I’m going to embrace it.” In response to the criticism, Phillips — dressed in a sleek, dark suit and fashionable clear-framed glasses — said at the hearing: “We haven’t spent a lot of time on community relations or government relations.” In August, Reuters reported that Piedmont indefinitely postponed its first shipments of spodumene ore to Tesla as it waited to get its permits in order, though in a public filing the company described the move as a “mutual agreement” to “extend” the “initial delivery dates.” “They might have put the cart before the horse a little bit with that deal,” said Gavin Montgomery, a battery raw materials analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Shortly afterward, shareholders filed two class action lawsuits accusing the company of giving investors and regulators a false picture of the project being ready to go and widely supported in the area. Lawyers representing the investors did not respond to repeated requests for comment. “We’re defending them vigorously and feel very strongly about our position,” Phillips said of the lawsuits. In the months that followed the public meeting, Piedmont seemed to hone its public messaging on jobs. The company promised to hire hundreds of workers — estimates in public statements have ranged from 300 to 500 — in a part of North Carolina that lost some furniture and textile manufacturing jobs to overseas competitors during late 20th century globalization. Salaries, the firm said, would top $80,000 per year in a county where the median annual income is a little over $53,000. But characterizations of Gaston County as some post-industrial husk seeking new economic lifeblood clash with what many here see as the potential next beneficiary of nearby Charlotte’s breakneck growth. The county’s unemployment rate in February was about 4%, in line with the national average. Gleaming new office parks line the highways that cut through the county, and in January construction was underway on several new buildings. Brown said virtually all the new corporate space is leased before construction is even complete. The businesses included a food-processing plant, a vehicle-lift manufacturer and an Amazon warehouse, which provided up to 40 jobs per acre of land the companies occupied, Brown said. By contrast, the Piedmont project offered one job per 6 acres. “Just because it’s jobs doesn’t mean it’s always the right fit,” Brown told me over breakfast at Cracker Barrel. “Some of the things they’ve rolled out are that we’re not doing very well economically. Well, I beg to differ.” Klanecky said Piedmont would create jobs for generations of workers in Gaston County, and not just in mining. “We think property values are going to increase once this operation is out here because you’re going to be attracting people making $90,000-plus a year,” he said. “They’re going to want to buy stuff.” At least one native has returned here to work at the mine. Piedmont hired Emily Blackburn, a 26-year-old geologist, to work on both community relations and resource exploration. “Piedmont Lithium brought me back home. I was in Minnesota after college,” Blackburn said. “Now I’m back at church with my parents. I moved back to my hometown. I got a fiancé.” She’s set to marry here in August. As the sun set over a field that would likely form the entrance to the mine, Eric Carpenter, 52, stood on his mother’s land and crossed his arms. The 5-acre parcel, once part of his grandfather’s cotton farm, is today filled with low, dense foliage and trees. The mine will “render our property worthless,” he said. Piedmont sent a representative to his 85-year-old mother’s home sometime between 2017 and 2018, he said, and proposed leasing the land. But Carpenter, who happened to be there when the employee showed up, asked to see a lease and run it by an attorney. The lease did not materialize, he said, and they never heard from the company again. In the meantime, Carpenter, an insurance underwriter, decided to research who would be liable for restoring the property after the mining was done. He found that the entire legal framework for approving projects like this in the state is the 1971 Mining Act, which caps the money state regulators can require a mine owner to set aside for cleanup and reclamation at $1 million. “This is really designed for a farmer who wants to sell sand from his property,” Carpenter said. “It doesn’t contemplate a mine of this size.” As things seemed to be moving forward last November, Carpenter said he spoke to L.T. McCrimmon, director of legislative affairs for Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. McCrimmon said the governor did not have the authority to issue an executive order halting mine permitting to give the legislature time to review and update the mining law. There didn’t seem to be much appetite in the legislature, anyway. That same month, Carpenter emailed his state legislators to ask about reviewing the law. State Sen. Kathy Harrington, who represents his district and is the Republican majority leader, never responded. State Rep. Kelly Hastings, a Republican, said the legislature had nothing to do with permitting the mine, and directed Carpenter to the governor, who oversees the regulatory agencies responsible for permitting mines. When Carpenter asked if Hastings would look into updating the law, he responded: “The General Assembly is not currently in session. Have a great Christmas.” By coincidence, the same week Carpenter started contacting his state leaders, an effort to reform a similarly outdated national mining law fell apart. On the federal level, the 1872 General Mining Law still governs hard-rock mining. Designed to encourage white settlement of the American West around the time of the California gold rush, the statute allows individuals or companies to stake claims on minerals found on public lands without paying royalties to the government. Mining companies have extracted some $300 billion worth of minerals from gold to lithium to copper from public lands since 1872, according to the environmental group Earthworks. And much like the North Carolina legislature, the U.S. Congress has been reluctant to update the law; last November, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) blocked a proposal to reform the 150-year-old legislation. A new bill from Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) is trying once again to add mining royalties and new protections, though critics have said it does little to require companies to seek input from communities near the projects. When Piedmont started buying property here, Klanecky said the county had no ordinances in place to regulate mining. Since then, he said, the county added some rules that the company supported. Those could help assuage some short-term concerns. But opponents of the project are thinking decades down the line, and remain skeptical of a technology that they do not see as a safe bet. What happens if an alternative battery chemistry seizes the market? In Australia, a company called Graphene Manufacturing Group claims its novel approach to making aluminum-ion battery cells could charge up to 70 times faster than lithium-ion batteries and hold three times as much energy as traditional aluminum-based cells. The company told Forbes it plans to roll out vehicle batteries in 2024. The Canadian startup Salient Energy says its zinc-ion batteries can compete directly with lithium-ion cells and offer a steadier domestic supply chain. But high energy costs and the war in Ukraine have sent prices soaring for a commodity that was already subject to market shocks similar to those that afflict lithium. Researchers in South Korea and a team from the U.S. and China recently made major breakthroughs with sodium-ion battery prototypes, though Arkady Krasheninnikov, a physicist studying the technology at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf laboratory, told the German broadcaster DW: “Our work is of a purely theoretical nature, and we do not claim that a new generation of batteries will be developed in the foreseeable future on the basis of our results.” Batteries built with vanadium are gaining attention as a potential competitor with lithium, particularly as prices of the latter metal continue to soar. In March, the Department of Energy issued a new category of license to help bring vanadium-based “flow” batteries to market. At an industry conference in May, James Hayter, an adviser at the natural resources investment fund Baker Steel Capital Managers, called vanadium “overlooked” and “more efficient than lithium-ion in the grid storage market,” according to a report from S&P Global Commodity Insights. “We’re bending over backwards to be as accommodating as we can to a lot of people. This is going to be a boom business. ... I think people will look back and come to the realization that this worked out an awful lot better than they thought.” But so-called flow batteries, which use external tanks of electrolyte fluids that pump through the device, will more likely “serve a part of the market that barely exists today for energy storage that can last for eight hours or more, while lithium-ion batteries will continue to be the leaders in shorter-duration storage, electric vehicles and consumer electronics,” a researcher from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado told Inside Climate News. Analysts say lithium demand is highly unlikely to drop off anytime soon — if anything, the rate of growth has exceeded projections. Piedmont, meanwhile, sees demand for the category of lithium it plans to produce soaring in the years to come. The high-nickel car-battery chemistry that yields longer range — a desirable trait in the U.S., where suburban sprawl means drivers face longer commute times than in other developed nations — tends to use more lithium hydroxide. Ideally, the U.S. could temper surging demand by increasing the availability of both public transit and recycling infrastructure to reuse existing lithium and other minerals, said Thea Riofrancos, an associate professor of political science at Providence College who co-authored a report on the U.S. battery supply chain for the nonprofit Climate and Community Project. “Our entire economic system is resource-intensive — but we live on a finite planet,” she said. “We could extract a lot less lithium, with fewer impacts on rural communities like those in Gaston County, if we took the opportunity of the energy transition to transform our transportation sector, building out mass transit and moving away from car dependency.” But Klanecky suggested some local opponents to the mine may have ideological blinders that make them less sensitive to the urgent realities of climate change. “This isn’t a place where you’re going to see something like the Bay Area, where everyone is going to convert to EVs because they think it’s good for the environment,” he said. Sixty-five percent of adults in Gaston County recognize that global warming is happening, 7 percentage points lower than the national average, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication’s 2021 survey. And 55% said local officials should do more to address climate change. But just 47% acknowledged that humans are causing climate change, while 37% said they believed warming was primarily due to natural cycles. That last claim was one Klanecky said he had heard before. “We want to listen to everybody and we want to educate everybody, but it’s hard to educate someone who thinks the Earth is tilted differently and that’s why it’s warmer or colder,” he said. Opponents of the project here say they aren’t numb to the climate concerns at all. Lancaster, the retiree, said he petitioned county officials to approve the big solar farm just down the block from his home. But in the face of ecological destruction on a scale few can reckon with, many here say they just want to preserve what they feel they have control over in their lives. “We have a high population here,” Pembleton said. “If things go wrong, responsibility will fall on the landowner to fight in court.” Phillips said it’s “not irrational” for the community to fear that “we’re some fly-by-night operation, and we’ll start this up and three weeks later we’ll run out of money and leave.” But, he said, “the good news is we’ve become a reasonably substantial company, we have investors like JPMorgan advising us. And we’ll have some very strong partners come into the project.” “We’re bending over backwards to be as accommodating as we can to a lot of people,” he said. “This is going to be a boom business. This is going to grow and grow and will be great for the community. I think people will look back and come to the realization that this worked out an awful lot better than they thought.” Harper doesn’t share that optimism. He had planned out his life. He would pass his business on to his 31-year-old daughter, who already works with him. He thought maybe, someday, his grandchildren would take over. And he would sit out on the porch in the afternoons watching his wife spend meditative hours listening to music on her headphones while she mowed the vast fields behind their home, and evenings observing the deer feast on the clippings. “This is God’s country. Each and every day we see turkey, deer, ringtail hawks, even a bald eagle that nests around here. This is a pristine, beautiful and tranquil area, and it’s going to be decimated,” Harper said. “All I can do is pray.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,"Pugs Can't Be Considered 'A Typical Dog' Due To Serious Health Issues, Study Says",environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A lot of people find pugs adorable, but there’s nothing cute about the serious health issues the dogs face. The small, flat-faced dogs are significantly more likely than non-pugs to suffer from a number of health problems, so much so that they “can no longer be considered a typical dog from a health perspective,” according to a new study from the United Kingdom’s Royal Veterinary College. The study, published this week in the journal Canine Medicine and Genetics, looked at clinical veterinary records of about 4,000 pugs and 22,000 non-pug dogs to determine the comparative odds of various canine health issues. Most significantly, pugs were found to have 54 times the odds of an average dog of having brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, which refers to a series of problems that can affect brachycephalic ― meaning flat-faced ― dogs. The shorter bones in the dogs’ faces can lead to multiple issues that can cause breathing difficulties ranging from mild to severe. The researchers also found pugs to be at an increased risk of 23 other disorders, including skin fold infections, skin allergies and obesity. Researchers did also find that pugs were less likely to suffer from some problems, including heart murmurs and aggression. Overall, however, “disease predispositions were more common than disease protections,” researchers wrote, adding that pugs face “many critical health-related welfare challenges.” The study’s findings did not “come as a surprise” to veterinary surgeon Myfanwy Hill of the University of Cambridge, she told the BBC. Hill, who was not involved with the study, said pugs’ “brains are squished into a box that is too small” and that using their small nostrils is like “trying to breathe through a really narrow straw.” Though this study focused on pugs, other flat-faced dogs like French and English bulldogs are also known to suffer from breathing difficulties. In April, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the U.K. urged would-be dog owners to avoid buying puppies of flat-faced breeds, saying “it’s wrong that we’re knowingly breeding for features which compromise their health.” And in February, Norway went a step further and banned the breeding of English bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles spaniels due to the breathing problems and other health issues they exhibit.

2,"Family Hears Noise, Finds 550-Pound Alligator 'Taking A Dip' In Their Pool",environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Bring a pool float, and make it snappy! A Florida family went out to investigate some “loud noises” at their Deep Creek home and discovered a nearly 11-foot alligator “taking a dip in their pool,” according to a Facebook post this week from the Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office. “Coming in at 10′11″ and weighing over 550lbs., he tore through the screen to get to the nice, cool water,” the sheriff’s office said, citing the situation as a reason to “always check your pool before diving in!” A trapper was able to catch and relocate the alligator ― along with another 11-foot gator he had also just trapped ― to Muse, Florida, a town that Sgt. Brad Stender told CNN was “more conducive” to alligators. During the spring and summer, alligators are on the move looking for mates and are more likely to end up closer to people’s homes, Stender said, adding that people should “keep their distance.” “They’re not going to attack you as long as you don’t go up to them,” he said. “Most of the time they’ll go on their way.” Of course, sometimes they get into a little trouble first. Last month, a Florida couple discovered that an alligator had gotten into their garage and gone to town on their soda supply. “Diet Coke was spewing everywhere,” home resident Karen Dobson told the Miami Herald. “It tore open the box, had a few cans.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
3,New York's Highest Court Weighs Question Of Whether Elephant Is A Person,environment," ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — She has four limbs, expressive eyes and likes to stroll through greenery in New York City. Happy, by species, is an Asian elephant. But can she also be considered a person? That question was before New York’s highest court Wednesday in a closely watched case over whether a basic human right can be extended to an animal. The advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project say yes: Happy is an autonomous, cognitively complex elephant worthy of the right reserved in law for “a person.” The Bronx Zoo, where Happy resides, says no: Through an attorney, the zoo argues Happy is neither illegally imprisoned nor a person, but a well-cared-for elephant “respected as the magnificent creature she is.” Happy has lived at the Bronx Zoo for 45 years. The state Court of Appeals heard arguments over whether she should be released through a habeas corpus proceeding, which is a way for people to challenge illegal confinement. The Nonhuman Rights Project wants her moved from a “one-acre prison” at the zoo to a more spacious sanctuary. “She has an interest in exercising her choices and deciding who she wants to be with, and where to go, and what to do, and what to eat,” project attorney Monica Miller told The Associated Press ahead of the oral arguments. “And the zoo is prohibiting her from making any of those choices herself.” The group said that in 2005, Happy became the first elephant to pass a self-awareness indicator test, repeatedly touching a white “X” on her forehead as she looked into a large mirror. The zoo and its supporters warn that a win for advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project could open the door to more legal actions on behalf of animals, including pets and other species in zoos. “If there’s going to entire be a rewrite and a granting to animals of rights that they never had before, shouldn’t that be done by the Legislature?” Kenneth Manning, an attorney for zoo operator Wildlife Conservation Society, asked the judges. Happy was born in the wild in Asia in the early 1970s, captured and brought as a 1-year-old to the United States, where she was eventually named for one of the characters from “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Happy arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1977 with fellow elephant Grumpy, who was fatally injured in a 2002 confrontation with two other elephants. Happy now lives in an enclosure adjacent to the zoo’s other elephant, Patty. The zoo’s attorney argued in court filings that Happy can swim, forage and engage in other behavior natural for elephants. “The blatant exploitation of Happy the elephant by NRP to advance their coordinated agenda shows no concern for the individual animal and reveals the fact they are willing to sacrifice Happy’s health and psychological well-being to set precedent,” the zoo said in a prepared statement. NRP’s attorneys say no matter how Happy is being treated at the zoo, her right to “bodily liberty” is being violated. They argue that if the court recognizes Happy’s right to that liberty under habeas corpus, she will be a “person” for that purpose. And then she must be released. Judges peppered attorneys for both side with pointed questions during oral arguments. Judge Jenny Rivera asked Miller about the implications of NRP’s position on human-animal relationships. “So does that mean that I couldn’t keep a dog?” Rivera asked. “I mean, dogs can memorize words.” Miller said right now there’s more evidence showing elephants are extraordinarily cognitively complex with advanced analytical abilities. Lower courts have ruled against the NRP. And the group has failed to prevail in similar cases, including those involving a chimpanzee in upstate New York named Tommy. But last October, at the urging of a different animal rights group, a federal judge ruled that Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s infamous “cocaine hippos” could be recognized as people or “interested persons” with legal rights in the U.S. The decision had no real ramifications for the hippos themselves, given that they reside in Colombia. Opponents hope the NRP’s string of court losses continues with the high-profile New York court. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the New York Farm Bureau and other agriculture groups said the NRP’s “new-fangled theory of personhood” would sweep up pigs, cows and chickens. The National Association for Biomedical Research said authorizing such petitions on behalf of animals could drive up the costs of conducting critical research. State and national associations representing veterinarians filed a brief saying NRP’s lawsuit promotes animals’ personhood rights above animals’ welfare. Supporters of NRP’s action include public figures such as Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe. Many of them see this case as a chance for society to take a step forward in the ethical treatment of animals. “We believe this legal moment for Happy represents a key cultural crossroads for thinking more openly and honestly—and less selfishly—about what it would mean to treat the particularity of non-human animals with the moral seriousness it deserves,” a brief submitted by Catholic academic theologians read. The court’s decision is expected in the coming months. At least one animal rights advocate suggests a lone court decision won’t change society’s view of animal use. Rutgers Law School professor Gary Francione, who is not involved in the case, said that would require a broader cultural shift. “I’ve been a vegan for 40 years. Don’t get me wrong, I disagree with animal use altogether,” Francione said. “Just to have the court start saying that non-human animals are persons under the law is going to raise all sorts of questions, the answers to which are not going to be amenable to many people.”"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"Rare Northern Michigan Tornado Kills 1, Injures More Than 40",environment," GAYLORD, Mich. (AP) — A rare northern Michigan tornado tore through a small community on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring more than 40 others as it flipped vehicles, tore roofs from buildings and downed trees and power lines. The twister hit Gaylord, a city of about 4,200 people roughly 230 miles (370 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, at around 3:45 p.m. Mike Klepadlo, who owns the car repair shop Alter-Start North, said he and his workers took cover in a bathroom. “I’m lucky I’m alive. It blew the back off the building,” he said. “Twenty feet (6 meters) of the back wall is gone. The whole roof is missing. At least half the building is still here. It’s bad.” Emma Goddard, 15, said she was working at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe when she got a phone alert about the tornado. Thinking the weather outside looked “stormy, but not scary,” she dismissed it and returned to what she was doing. Her mother then called and she assured her mom she was OK. Two minutes later, she was pouring a customer’s smoothie when her coworker’s mom rushed in yelling for them to get to the back of the building, Goddard told The Associated Press by text message. They took shelter in the walk-in cooler, where they could hear windows shattering. “I was crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with my seven co-workers, two of my co-workers’ parents and a lady from Door Dash coming to pick up her smoothies.” When they left the cooler about 15 minutes later and stepped outside, they saw “some of our cars in pieces and insulation all over the ground,” Goddard said. Three neighboring businesses were destroyed, she said. Brian Lawson, a spokesman for Munson Healthcare, said Otsego Memorial Hospital was treating 23 people injured by the tornado and that one person was killed. He didn’t know the conditions of the injured or the name of the person who died. The Michigan State Patrol confirmed that one person was killed, saying in a tweet that more than 40 others were hurt and being treated at area hospitals. The patrol planned to hold a briefing Saturday morning. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” Mayor Todd Sharrard said. “I’m numb.” Video posted online showed a dark funnel cloud materialize out of a cloud as nervous drivers looked on or slowly drove away, uncertain of its path. Other video showed extensive damage along the city’s Main Street. One building appeared to be largely collapsed and a Goodwill store was badly damaged. A collapsed utility pole lay on the side of the road, and debris, including what appeared to be electrical wires and parts of a Marathon gas station, was scattered all along the street. The Red Cross set up a shelter at a church. Brandie Slough, 42, said she and a teen daughter sought safety in a restroom at a Culver’s. Windows of the fast food restaurant were blown out when they emerged, and her pickup truck had been flipped on its roof in the parking lot. “We shook our heads in disbelief but are thankful to be safe. At that point, who cares about the truck,” Slough said. Eddie Thrasher, 55, said he was sitting in his car outside an auto parts store when the tornado seemed to appear above him. “There are roofs ripped off businesses, a row of industrial-type warehouses,” Thrasher said. “RVs were flipped upside down and destroyed. There were a lot of emergency vehicles heading from the east side of town.” He said he ran into the store to ride it out. “My adrenaline was going like crazy,” Thrasher said. “In less than five minutes it was over.” Extreme winds are uncommon in this part of Michigan because the Great Lakes suck energy out of storms, especially early in spring when the lakes are very cold, said Jim Keysor, a Gaylord-based meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “Many kids and young adults would have never experienced any direct severe weather if they had lived in Gaylord their entire lives,” he said. The last time Gaylord had a severe wind storm was in 1998, when straight-line winds reached 100 mph, Keysor said. He said the conditions that spawned Friday’s twister included a cold front moving in from Wisconsin and hitting hot and humid air over Gaylord, with the added ingredient of turning winds in the lower part of the atmosphere. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Otsego County, making further state resources available to the county. Gaylord, known as the “Alpine Village,” is set to celebrate its 100th birthday this year, with a centennial celebration that will include a parade and open house at City Hall later this summer. The community also holds the annual Alpenfest in July, an Alpine-inspired celebration honoring the city’s heritage and a partnership with a sister city in Switzerland. ___ White reported from Detroit.

11,"The U.S., Struggling To Curb Emissions, Just Lost Another Nuclear Power Plant",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The United States has lost yet another nuclear power plant despite the Biden administration’s efforts to prevent the country’s largest source of zero-carbon electricity from shrinking any further. On Friday, the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, an 800-megawatt reactor plant in southwest Michigan, shut down more than a week early, dashing hopes that a last-ditch appeal by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) for federal funding might prevent the site from going offline. The plant, with the capacity to power 800,000 homes, safely operated for 50 years on the shores of Lake Michigan. But the facility, like many other U.S. nuclear plants, struggled to make money as cheap natural gas gobbled up its share of the electricity market. Utility giant Entergy, the plant’s owner, announced in 2017 it would close the plant by 2022. Last month, Whitmer sent a letter to the Department of Energy formally requesting a share of a $6 billion fund the White House established to bail out financially-troubled but safe-to-operate reactors. Opened in 1971, the plant was licensed to operate through 2031. The plant was scheduled to shut down permanently on May 31. But on Friday Entergy said it moved the closure up by 11 days after its operators identified a “performance issue” with a mechanical part of the reactor, a control rod drive seal, and “made the conservative decision to shut down the plant early.” “The enduring legacy of Palisades is the thousands of men and women who safely, reliably, and securely operated the plant, helping power Southwest Michigan homes and businesses for more than 50 years,” Darrell Corbin, Entergy’s site vice president, said in a press release. “We refer to a credo at Palisades: ‘Palisades Proud.’ Thanks to the pride, professionalism, and hard work of our 600-member team, we finished Palisades Proud.” Workers lamented the closure. Once Entergy removes the reactor, it plans to sell the plant to New Jersey-based Holtec International, a nuclear reactor component maker, to decommission the site. Michigan generates the majority of its electricity by burning natural gas and coal, which cause climate change and spew disease-causing particulate matter into the air. If gas power replaces the electricity Palisades produced, Michigan’s annual greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 2.8 million metric tons, according to an analysis of federal data by the pro-nuclear think tank the Breakthrough Institute. That’s equivalent to adding more than 600,000 cars to the road. If the Great Lake State’s coal-fired J. H. Campbell Generating Plant makes up the difference, emissions will go up by 5.9 million metric tons — equal to nearly 1.3 million additional automobiles. “If Michigan decided to tear up every wind turbine and solar panel in the state there would be outrage,” Zeke Hausfather, a prominent climate scientist who has worked on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, wrote on Twitter in response to the news. “This is the same amount of carbon free energy lost.” Fossil fuels have replaced nuclear plants in virtually every place where reactors shut down. After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Germany began rapidly closing its nuclear plants even as it sought to open new coal mines. The country became more reliant on Russian natural gas. Now, as the war in Ukraine compels Germany to slash its Russian imports, Europe’s largest economy is considering extending its deadline for quitting coal entirely. In April, the Indian Point Energy Center, the nuclear plant that provided the bulk of New York City’s zero-carbon electricity, permanently closed after decades of protests by environmentalists. Overnight, fossil fuels’ share of the grid that powers the nation’s largest city soared to 90%. Critics of nuclear power say the energy source’s 80-year safety record does not justify the potentially catastrophic risks of human error, exemplified in the only two deadly reactor meltdowns in history, Fukushima and 1986’s Chernobyl. Another lesser accident, the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island in 1979, stoked those fears closer to home. Depictions in popular culture including hit documentaries and miniseries on those past accidents, and Homer Simpson, the buffoonish nuclear plant operator in “The Simpsons,” have driven home the risks associated with atomic energy. But pro-nuclear advocates say the industry’s steady safety improvements and stringent regulation make it a vital tool, especially given the unrivaled efficiency and reliability of producing electricity with heat from a fission reaction. And they say the risks fossil fuels pose, both to the planet’s habitability and the health of communities living nearby, are far greater. Many environmentalists hope renewables alone can provide enough electricity to simultaneously phase out nuclear power and fossil fuels. But solar and wind power depend on weather conditions and require huge numbers of panels and turbines to produce electricity in the volumes needed to equal fission or fossil. Improved transmission infrastructure would help move renewable electricity from where it’s abundant to where it’s needed, but local opposition to power lines has made them difficult to build. And the more climate-polluting sectors like transportation and building heating transition to electric alternatives, the more that power will be needed on the grid. Diablo Canyon Power Plant, California’s last nuclear station and the source of nearly 10% of the state’s electricity, is now the next of the U.S.’s remaining 90 or so plants slated for closure, in 2025. Despite already contributing by far the largest share of humanity’s cumulative carbon dioxide mess in the atmosphere, the U.S. has struggled to lower its emissions in the face of mounting warming-fueled disasters and dire warnings from scientists. The country’s carbon output increased 6% last year as the economy rebounded from pandemic-related lockdowns. Emissions are expected to grow by another 2% this year. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Watchdog Group Re-Ups Complaint Against A Texas Nonprofit Fighting Biden’s Conservation Goal,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A progressive watchdog group has renewed its call for the IRS to investigate whether a Texas-based property rights organization is violating its tax-exempt nonprofit status as it campaigns against the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.” Accountable.US filed an initial complaint with the IRS last year, accusing the fringe, right-wing American Stewards of Liberty of violating its 501(c)(3) status by lobbying against 30x30 at the federal, state and local levels. This week, Accountable amended its complaint with new evidence, including internal communications that HuffPost obtained via a public records request. Accountable argues that the new evidence further proves American Stewards is working to influence legislation in violation of tax code rules. As HuffPost revealed last month, Margaret Byfield, the executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, developed a cozy relationship inside Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts’ office, and worked behind the scenes to guide the Republican governor’s response to 30x30. Byfield advised Ricketts on the conservation initiative and other environmental policy issues, even playing a direct role in crafting an executive order, signed by the governor in late June, that aimed to prevent President Joe Biden from implementing his 30x30 plan in Nebraska. In a supplemental letter sent to the IRS on Thursday, Accountable.US noted that American Stewards has “expanded its federal lobbying efforts” and is publicly backing a pair of congressional bills, dubbed the “30x30 Termination Act,” that seek to block Biden’s 30x30 pledge. Two of the bills’ main sponsors, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), were keynote speakers at American Stewards’ “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska, last month. The letter also cites HuffPost’s recent reporting on Byfield’s influence within Ricketts’ office, and how she requested and apparently secured a statement from the governor in support of Boebert’s anti-30x30 bill. “By its own admission, a significant portion of American Stewards’ activities involve attempts to influence legislation, and its primary objective can only be achieved through advocating for or against legislation,” Jordan Schreiber, energy and environment director at Accountable.US, said in a statement. “Such an approach violates their nonprofit tax status.” American Stewards has advanced sweeping, evidence-free claims that the 30x30 initiative is a federal “land grab” in disguise. Its rhetoric is now being parroted by a growing number of Republican lawmakers and right-wing organizations. And the disinformation-rich campaign has succeeded in drumming up fear in rural communities about a looming federal takeover of private property rights. Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist and ethics expert at the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen, agrees that American Stewards’ activities run afoul of its tax-exempt status. He noted that in its newsletter, American Stewards has called on its audience to contact their elected representatives to urge them to back specific legislation. “This constitutes ‘indirect lobbying,’ which is prohibited for charities,” Holman said via email. The IRS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. On its website, however, it explains that “a 501(c)(3) organization may engage in some lobbying, but too much lobbying activity risks loss of tax-exempt status.” “An organization will be regarded as attempting to influence legislation if it contacts, or urges the public to contact, members or employees of a legislative body for the purpose of proposing, supporting, or opposing legislation, or if the organization advocates the adoption or rejection of legislation,” the agency’s website reads. In a May 2021 newsletter, American Stewards wrote: “If your Representative is not signed on, please call their office and request they co-sponsor Rep. Boebert’s ‘30 x 30 Termination Act.’ Deadline to sign on is this Friday.” Additionally, Holman said the revelations in HuffPost’s report last month — namely, that Byfield helped craft Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30 and procure a statement from the governor in support of Boebert’s legislation — constitute “direct lobbying,” which is also prohibited for 501(c)(3) nonprofits. “There appears to be many different activities that qualify American Stewards as an ‘action organization,’ and thereby disqualifying it from tax-exempt status,” Holman said. “By all accounts, the IRS should take a closer look at the operations of American Stewards of Liberty and decide whether the organization is worthy of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.” Byfield did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. She is, however, keenly aware of Accountable.US and its work. In emails to one of Ricketts’ top staffers, which HuffPost obtained as part of its records request, Byfield warned that Accountable.US had been filing public records requests for American Stewards’ communications with counties in numerous states — “Your office may receive a similar request,” she wrote — and scrutinizing the group’s tax status. And at the “Stop 30x30 Summit” last month, Trump-era Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, one of the event’s keynote speakers, slammed the organization’s president, Kyle Herrig, for an op-ed he wrote about American Stewards ahead of its summit in Nebraska. “I don’t like bullies,” Bernhardt said, referring to Herrig. “Where I’m from, people don’t bully each other.” In May 2021, Bernhardt donated $2,000 to Boebert’s reelection campaign. Boebert, who represents Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colorado, is herself notorious for bullying, trolling and mocking people on Twitter. Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Carpenters Are Betting Big On America's Transition To Renewable Energy,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost SICKLERVILLE, N.J. — On an overcast day last week, a union carpenter welded steel plates together at the bottom of a man-made lake as interested onlookers gathered around a laptop on a floating barge above to watch a live-feed video of his work. For years, the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters recruited commercial divers from Divers Academy International, a dive school outside Philadelphia. But in February, the union purchased the property as part of a broader effort to get out ahead of what many anticipate — and hope — will soon be a booming offshore wind industry along the East Coast. It is the first union-owned and operated commercial dive school in the nation. “What do they say, ‘Build it and they will come?’ Well, we bought it, so bring them on,” William Sproule, executive secretary-treasurer of EASRCC, told a room full of union piledrivers, millwrights and carpenters during a tour of the facility. President Joe Biden set a goal of securing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 10 million homes for a year and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. And he and his administration talk often about how deploying clean energy and confronting global climate change is an opportunity to create millions of high-paying union jobs. Erecting wind farms at sea requires a lot of underwater work, including welding and inspections. As soon as this summer, the union will be able to provide its members with in-house training in underwater welding and other specialized skills required in the construction and maintenance of offshore wind turbines, oil rigs, bridges, dams, nuclear power plants and shipyards. EASRCC purchased the dive school for $1.9 million after the school’s previous owner landed in legal and financial trouble, and has so far invested another $500,000 in repairing and upgrading equipment at the facility. The school features classrooms, offices, a dock with dive and underwater welding stations and a decompression chamber. The facility is in the process of being certified by the Association of Diving Contractors International. The carpenter’s union is betting on America’s energy transition and the jobs that are promised to come with it. In late 2020, before investing in its own dive school, it spent approximately $800,000 on a 13-acre lot where it is building out an expanded heavy construction, pile driving and offshore wind training facility. The site is located across the street from the union’s existing training center in Hammonton, New Jersey, approximately 30 miles northwest of Atlantic City. What was recently a forested area of the Pine Barrens is now clear of trees and features mock-up construction sites. As carpenters, local elected officials, wind industry representatives and members of the public gathered at the facility for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new training grounds on May 11, apprentices and journeypersons trained on a crane, pile driver and other heavy machinery. A solar array has already gone up in one corner of the property. The union is now working to secure its own wind turbine and GE-manufactured nacelle, which houses the turbine’s gears and other electronics, in order to train millwrights on installation and maintenance. Sproule called the facility “a dream come true” and expects the return on investment to be huge. “We’re ready to train the workforce for this industry that is going to be a big part of New Jersey’s economy,” Sproule said. “We’re hoping this will create opportunities for all kinds of young adults that may be interested in getting involved.” Sproule is a first-generation carpenter and 33-year union member. He got his start in the trade in 1989 and spent the final years of his apprenticeship training at the Hammonton facility. The skills he learned during that time allowed him to move up the union ladder, from apprentice to journeyman and eventually agent and organizer. But what he realized during his years laboring in Atlantic City on high-rise buildings and the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector tunnel was how difficult it is for workers to hone heavy machinery skills in a shop or classroom setting. Those skills largely came with experience in the field. He wanted training to mimic that. “I always had a vision to someday take things outside,” he told HuffPost. “It’s all about hands-on work with cranes and equipment, just like real-world job sites, so our apprentices have more experience before they even hit the job site.” EASRCC is one of several councils within the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, one of the largest building trade unions in North America. The council represents some 41,000 members in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia. The union’s efforts are significant for a trade that has long relied on fossil fuel industry jobs, including pipeline and refinery construction. While there is a lot of excitement about offshore wind within the union, there is trepidation among members in fossil fuel-producing states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia, Sproule said. He said he doesn’t expect renewable energy to take hold overnight but wants workers to be prepared as the sector continues to grow. “We’re at the beginning of something,” Sproule said. “It’s almost like a revolution. As ratepayers and taxpayers and people that depend on having electricity for our homes, we have to support all forms and methods of creating electricity and transmitting energy, but we want to be a part of this renewable [transition] because we know this is a big part of the future.” The U.S. lags far behind Europe on offshore wind production; however, the nascent industry looks poised to take off. EASRCC’s recent investments are aimed at ensuring union carpenters in the Eastern Atlantic and around the country are proficient and competitive when offshore wind developers begin filling jobs. While pile drivers and millwrights will be needed for the installation and maintenance of offshore wind farms, other skilled carpenters will be key for building out transmission lines and other supporting infrastructure on land. “We’re always thinking ahead,” said Frank Mahoney, a spokesman for the union. “If we’re not ready, we could easily lose out. The carpenters we train could lose out.” The Biden administration has made strides toward its wind energy goals. It granted final approval to two major offshore wind projects: the long-stalled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, and South Fork Wind project off Rhode Island. It established a new priority wind area in New York Bight, the waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast, and advanced permitting for the proposed 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project off the coast of southern New Jersey. Its first offshore wind lease sale in February brought in a stunning $4.37 billion in high bids — more than any offshore energy auction in U.S. history, including all oil and gas lease sales — across nearly half a million acres in New York Bight. And the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden championed and Congress passed last year included $65 billion for electricity grid upgrades that will support the emerging offshore wind sector. New Jersey itself is angling to become the hub of the U.S. offshore wind sector. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy set a goal of developing 7.5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, enough to power 3 million homes in the Garden State. In April, EEW American Offshore Structures broke ground on a $250 million monopile manufacturing facility at the Port of Paulsboro, on the Delaware River outside Philadelphia, where union laborers will construct the massive, 2,500-ton steel tubes that will anchor turbines to the seafloor. Work is also underway on the New Jersey Wind Port, where turbine blades and nacelles will be assembled and staged before being transported out to sea. All told, offshore wind could generate $150 billion in private investment in New Jersey alone over the next 15 years, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in April. And job creation has already started. “It’s happening. The creation of thousands of jobs is happening in the offshore wind industry, including carpenters, laborers, electricians, engineers and diesel mechanics,” New Jersey Labor Commissioner Rob Asaro-Angelo said at last week’s event in Hammonton. “The increase in job opportunities here [is] going to provide unbelievable opportunities for all of our families in South Jersey and across the country.” There are major discrepancies in wages for fossil fuel workers versus those in the renewable energy sector, however. A report last year from clean energy think tank Energy Futures Initiative found that the median hourly wages of oil, natural gas and coal workers were $26.59, $30.33 and $28.69, respectively, compared to $24.48 for solar and $25.48 for wind. That wage gap is at least in part due to there being approximately double the number of unionized workers in fossil fuels than in renewables. Closing these gaps will be key for renewable energy developers to attract workers. At least two major offshore wind developers, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind and Ørsted, have signed agreements to use union labor for their planned projects. And Atlantic Power Transmission LLC, a Blackstone company vying to build the transmission lines that connect offshore wind farms to the grid, has partnered with EASRCC and other unions and committed to investing $50 million for workforce development in New Jersey. Andy Geissbuehler, the CEO of APT, told HuffPost at EASRCC’s ribbon-cutting ceremony last week that it is critical that states like New Jersey continue to move quickly on workforce training, and for manufacturing facilities and supply chains to be in close proximity to where wind farms are being developed. “We need to build this industry now,” he said. “If you compare with onshore wind, the U.S. was very late with onshore wind. But you know how it goes. We are very fast, we catch up, and now we are a global leader. The same should happen in offshore wind.” Angela Woodman, an Army veteran and apprentice piledriver, is among those who stand to benefit from the anticipated boom. She joined the union’s Sisters in the Brotherhood program four years ago after her sister told her about it. Her first week in, she saw a video about dock building and decided that’s what she wanted to do. Woodman isn’t one to work a desk job. She likes being outside, working with her hands and getting dirty, and her years as a union laborer have been some of the most enjoyable of her life, she said. She hasn’t closely followed the latest news on offshore wind along the East Coast but is plugged in enough to be excited about both the environmental benefits and the career opportunities it will bring to her home state of New Jersey. A skilled welder, she plans to look into what it would take to use those skills underwater and get certified as a commercial diver. More than anything, she said, carpenters want stable, long-term work. And the construction of several massive offshore wind farms promises just that. “The working-class people got to stay working,” she said. Language has been amended to clarify the union’s previous relationship with the dive school. Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Republicans Still Control A Key Mine Safety Agency In Biden’s Second Year As President,environment," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Sixteen months into the Biden presidency, Republicans still effectively control a federal agency that oversees mine safety, frustrating miner advocates who say the Trump nominees will continue to hand down decisions friendly to mine operators. Not many people outside the industry would be familiar with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent agency that reviews legal disputes stemming from citations and fines against mining companies. But the commission plays a crucial role in making sure workers come out of their mines alive, by interpreting health and safety law and seeing that it’s properly enforced by federal inspectors. When the Mine Safety and Health Administration issues fines against a mine operator, the operator can appeal them to the commission. In general, a commission more aligned with operators than safety hawks is going to make it harder for inspectors to enforce the law aggressively. The commission is supposed to have five sitting members who serve staggered terms and adjudicate cases as a panel. By tradition, the president’s party gets three members and the other party gets two. But right now, the agency only has three Senate-confirmed commissioners, with a 2-1 GOP majority. The two Republican members, William Althen and Marco Rajkovich, are longtime lawyers for mining companies. The lone Democrat is Art Traynor, a union lawyer formerly with the United Mine Workers of America. President Joe Biden designated Traynor the commission’s chair, but Traynor can still be outvoted by his two GOP counterparts on contentious cases that set precedent. Such decisions can determine when a mine operator might be fined for safety violations, or when a miner is protected under the law for their safety activism. “It’s not right to have a Democratic president and Republicans constituting the majority of the commission. For all miners in the U.S., these are extremely important positions.” The White House has put up two more nominees who, if confirmed, would fill all the commission’s seats and create the 3-2 Democratic majority expected under a Democratic president. Those nominees have cleared the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions but still have not gotten a vote on the Senate floor. Elections are supposed to determine the direction of federal policy, but lesser-known agencies like the mine commission often wind up rudderless for long stretches, said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks presidential nominees. Stier said the Biden White House, like most recent administrations, has been slow to fill many roles (though not as slow as former President Donald Trump). He said much of the problem lies with the Senate. “It’s a classic small pipe with too much being jammed through it,” he said. “It’s the agencies that don’t have the overall political pull that end up falling by the wayside.” Tony Oppegard, a lawyer who represents miners in safety cases, said he has long viewed the commission as too favorable to operators. He was hoping the Democratic election victories in 2020 would change its complexion and lead to decisions that strengthen the law in miners’ favors. He noted that the commission shapes safety not just in coal mines but in metal and nonmetal mines across the country as well. “It’s not right to have a Democratic president and Republicans constituting the majority of the commission,” said Oppegard, many of whose clients are safety whistleblowers. “For all miners in the U.S., these are extremely important positions, because they interpret the law of the [Mine Safety and Health Act] and all the intricacies of that law.” An aide for Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the HELP committee, said she was pressing for a floor vote for the would-be commissioners. “Senator Murray is pushing hard to confirm Mary Lu Jordan and T.J. Baker — two highly qualified nominees committed to mine workers’ safety — and believes there is simply no reason for any further delay,” the aide said in an email. But even if the commission winds up with a Democratic majority, it might not last long. All three of the current commissioners were appointed by the previous administration and confirmed by the then-GOP-controlled Senate as a group in 2019. But the Trump administration placed Traynor, the only Democrat, in the commission seat set to expire first, a move that could end up strengthening the GOP’s hold on the commission. Traynor’s seat comes open this August, while Althen and Rajkovich hold their seats until August 2024. That means even if Democrats approve the two nominees awaiting a Senate vote, they would need to promptly reconfirm Traynor or install a new nominee in his place in order to avoid a 2-2 commission that might deadlock on cases by the end of the summer. With control of the commission essentially up for grabs, the agency has turned into a political football. As E&E News recently reported, Republicans with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform have accused Traynor of “political interference” and “inappropriate management practices” as the commission’s chair. Traynor told HuffPost the allegations are an untrue smear. But even if unfounded, they could hurt Traynor’s prospects for reappointment, forcing Democrats to get another nominee through the process to establish a majority on the commission. Traynor said the Trump administration’s maneuvering with commission seats has left Democrats with three consecutive seats to fill from their own party, making a bipartisan compromise less likely with Republicans. “Since it’s all Democrats, they’ve unleashed the slime,” he said. Traynor recently sent a letter to the HELP committee alleging “seriously unethical and criminal misconduct” by commission employees under the watch of Althen and Rajkovich, including fraudulent work benefits being issued through a COVID-19 relief program, according to E&E. Althen and Rajkovich have called the allegations false. Traynor said his biggest concern is how safety law is being shaped. He said the commission will tilt the law in mine operators’ favor so long as Republicans outnumber Democrats. “In their short time in the majority, they have done a lot of damage to the legal protections that have been in place for miners for decades,” he said. Althen said he took offense to that. “This stuff about us undercutting miner safety is just not true,” he said. “I completely reject the notion that operator lawyers are bad people who don’t care about the workers. I’ve been at fatality sites.” Rajkovich declined an interview request but said in an email that the idea that the Republican commissioners would undermine safety is “erroneous.” “I have spent a lifetime in the mining field always placing safety first,” he said. “As a Commissioner, my role (and the role of all Commissioners) is to take an impartial view and decide cases fairly, and based on the law.” Perhaps the most contentious case before the commission involves a subsidiary of coal giant Peabody Energy. The majority could set a precedent that makes it easier for mine operators to avoid “significant and substantial” safety violations, saving tens of thousands of dollars in potential fines and avoiding mine shutdowns. Traynor says that the majority’s position would make it much harder to enforce a requirement that operators have underground shelters for miners in emergency situations. “In their short time in the majority, they have done a lot of damage to the legal protections that have been in place for miners for decades.” The commission has not yet issued its decision. In a public hearing last year, Traynor argued that his colleagues were going out of their way to alter a prior decision to the industry’s benefit. The hearing grew heated, with Traynor calling Rajkovich dishonest, and Traynor and Althen eventually shouting at one another. Althen accused Traynor of slow-walking the case so they couldn’t issue the decision, saying Traynor was “looking for two more commissioners.” The midterm elections this fall could further complicate efforts to reshape the commission, depending on how long seats go vacant. If Republicans end up taking control of the Senate next year, they could block Biden from filling any open positions, preventing a Democratic majority. Similar problems hang over another worker safety agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which adjudicates citations issued by OSHA inspectors. That agency is a three-member body, but it currently has just two Senate-confirmed commissioners, one Democrat and one Republican. The White House withdrew the nomination of a potential third commissioner, Democrat Susan Harthill, without an explanation last month. As with the mine safety review commission, it isn’t clear when the agency will have all its seats filled and controlled by a Democratic majority. Debbie Berkowitz, a workplace safety expert and former OSHA official, said a deadlocked commission will be unable to decide certain cases where the commissioners don’t agree. And under the law, she said, employers won’t have to address the alleged hazards in their OSHA citations so long as the appeals are sitting there with the commission. “It’s good for Republicans and their big business supporters that these agencies either don’t function or they remain in Republican hands,” she said. “Who suffers are mine workers and other workers in dangerous industries.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,'I Owe Her My Life': Dog On The Mend After Rescuing Owner From Mountain Lion,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Not all heroes wear capes. According to Erin Wilson, her dog saved her life on Monday. Wilson was walking near the Trinity River in a rural area in northern California when a mountain lion approached and lunged at her, swiping and scratching her left shoulder, Wilson told the Sacramento Bee. “I yelled out for help from my dog Eva. She was only a few yards ahead of me and attacked the lion,” Wilson wrote on a GoFundMe campaign to pay for the vet bills. “They battled for a few moments until I heard her cry. The cat had her by the left side of her head. For the next several minutes I tried everything I could to free her. Eventually I ran to my vehicle for a weapon and flagged down assistance from a kind woman named Sharon. Together we beat at the cat while yelling until my dog was let go.” Eva was badly wounded and it took an hour to get her to the vet. “Midway through, Eva began convulsing for several minutes at a time. I didn’t think she’d make it every time it started up,” Wilson said. “Fortunately she pulled through and received urgent treatment.” Eva suffered two skull fractures, a puncture to her sinus cavity and severe swelling around her eye. “My dog is my hero and I owe her my life,” Wilson wrote. According to posts on Eva’s Instagram page Wednesday, she is still at the vet. But she’s on the mend and should be able to go home on Thursday. A post shared by Eva B The Maligator (@eva_the_mal) A post shared by Eva B The Maligator (@eva_the_mal) A post shared by Eva B The Maligator (@eva_the_mal) Wilson said she had already raised enough funds to cover Eva’s medical bills, and plans to donate surplus funds to charities after factoring in the cost of aftercare and some “very solid pampering” for her dog. She’s currently looking into helping Malinois rescues, big cat rescues and predator management groups. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Tennessee Couple Finds Stray Dog Cuddled Up Next To Them In Bed,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A couple in Tennessee was recently stunned to wake up and find a big, sweet, cuddly dog curled up next to them in bed. Jimmy Johnson rolled over and asked his wife, “Julie, whose dog is this?” The Johnsons have three large hounds, who usually share their kingsized bed with them. But this time, a beige mystery dog was splayed across their mattress. Once they realized the dog was no threat, the couple snapped photos and posted them on Facebook to find her owners. “This is the weirdest post I have ever had to make,” Julie Johnson wrote. “Is this your dog?” According to a “pupdate” posted by Julie, the dog, whose name is Nala, slipped away from her owners while on a walk just ahead of a thunderstorm. Apparently Nala squeezed through a loose door at the Johnsons’ home to find somewhere safe and warm to wait it out. The Johnsons’ dogs didn’t even raise a fuss when she hopped into their bed. Nala was eventually reunited with her parents and became a media superstar. However, her owners are a tad embarrassed about their dog’s lack of boundaries. “Our overly friendly pup, Nala, has hit an all time record for ignoring personal space and added yet another trick to her long list of Houdini acts,” Cris Hawkins, one of Nala’s owners, wrote on Facebook. “Shame [on] Nala for somehow breaking into a stranger’s house and invading their personal space,” Hawkins added. “Thankfully, the couple thought it was hilarious and they aren’t even mad about it.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,How A Major Tar Sands Pipeline Project Threatens Indigenous Land Rights,environment," Investigative journalist This article was produced in partnership with Type Investigations. Near the banks of the North Thompson River in British Columbia, about 400 miles northeast of Vancouver, the Tiny House Warriors village announces itself with a hand-painted sign attached to wooden stakes: “Unceded Secwepemc Territory.” The area is quiet and remote, with tall stands of spruce and cedar forming part of the world’s largest inland temperate rainforest. At the entrance to the village, a pile of logs creates a makeshift barricade. Beyond it, a cluster of five small wood-framed homes sit on trailers, their walls decorated with colorful murals depicting elements of the Secwepemc people’s history and culture. About half a dozen people live in the village, but those numbers are frequently swelled by visitors, and in mid-December, the site was bustling with activity. Flora Sampson, a tribal elder, gave lessons on the Secwepemc language to camp participants, together with her granddaughter. Others performed songs on deerskin drums and told stories about the recent history of Secwepemc land struggles. Earlier in the year, residents made daily trips to the nearby river to honor and celebrate the thrashing, silvery salmon and trout migrating upstream. “Like my grandpa George says, our culture flows from the land, our language flows from the land,” said Kanahus Manuel, who together with her twin sister Mayuk founded the Tiny House Warriors village in 2017. “When we resist and stand up and fight back, we’re saving ourselves from extinction.” As much as the Tiny House Warriors village has been a hub for maintaining Indigenous culture, it has also been a hub of resistance. The homes sit on a road alongside a construction site related to a massive expansion of the federally owned Trans Mountain Pipeline, a 1,150-km (710-mile) pipeline that carries 300,000 barrels of tar sands diluted bitumen every day from Alberta through British Columbia to an endpoint on the Canadian coast outside Vancouver. First proposed by the energy company Kinder Morgan in 2013, the expansion project would place a new pipeline alongside the existing one, almost tripling the system’s total capacity to 890,000 barrels per day. Canadian officials are relying on the project to move the country closer to its goal of becoming a global “energy superpower,” as then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged in 2006. At the center of his plan was the development of Alberta’s tar sands, enormous underground reserves of sand, clay, and oil spanning an area approximately the size of Florida. In the following years, energy companies proposed a series of new pipelines across Canada and the United States to deliver the high carbon-emitting oil from the tar sands to refineries and markets abroad, including the Trans Mountain expansion, Keystone XL, Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Enbridge Line 3. Today, roughly 3.5 million barrels of tar sands are mined daily, nearly all of it shipped to U.S. refineries. Opponents of tar sands development, however, view it as a fulcrum for the rapidly accelerating climate crisis. The Northern Gateway and Energy East pipelines were canceled in 2016 and 2017 in the face of protests, and the Biden administration revoked the construction permit for Keystone XL last year. Construction of Line 3 was finally completed in September 2021, after overcoming a large opposition movement that saw over 900 arrests in protests across Minnesota. For now, the Trans Mountain expansion is the only major tar sands pipeline battle currently at hand. The Canadian government has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure its completion. “Right now, we’re prisoners to the American market,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2019 when announcing the project’s approval. Construction of the expanded pipeline began later that year, and the government hopes it will be up and running by fall 2023. But the project has run up against determined opposition from First Nations groups and environmentalists, as well as municipalities, student groups, and some labor groups and politicians. Since the project’s proposal in 2013, protesters have staged dozens of actions to block construction along the pipeline’s route, resulting in over 300 arrests. Well over a dozen legal challenges have been mounted since the project was first announced, including by numerous First Nations, like the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. The Tiny House Warriors village has been a prominent flashpoint in the conflict. Nearly half of the pipeline expansion’s proposed route lies within the territory of the Secwepemc Nation, which, like nearly all First Nations in British Columbia, has never relinquished its land to the Canadian government by treaty, land sale, or surrender. Secwepemc opponents of the project have argued that its construction violates their right to govern their own territory. By establishing a small village in the project’s path, the Tiny House Warriors have staked claim to land they argue belongs to their people. In recent years, the Canadian government has been working to acknowledge its legacy of colonialism and heal its relationship with Indigenous people. However, the government and pipeline companies have fiercely opposed Indigenous land claims in court. In particular, they’ve used court-ordered injunctions to force First Nations peoples off their land through police enforcement, according to researchers at the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nations-led think tank at Ryerson University. These injunctions, which can prevent protesters from blocking pipeline construction and other commercial activities such as logging and mining, have enabled the government and energy companies to make an end run around Indigenous land claims. This dynamic is playing out vividly at the Tiny House Warriors village. “Basically everything about the legal system is skewed against Native people,” said Pam Palmater, an Indigenous Mi’kmaq lawyer, Ryerson University professor, and activist. “Federal and provincial governments and even corporations use the justice system, they weaponize it against First Nations, land defenders, Indigenous people in a multitude of ways.” The Tiny House Warriors village was first established in 2017, after a traditional Secwepemc assembly declared its opposition to the Trans Mountain expansion, arguing that the project posed a threat to the local ecology and their land. But there are other motivations as well. Village inhabitants say the impending influx of construction workers to the site will pose a safety risk to women in the area; a 2019 report by Canada’s National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found “substantial evidence” that temporary worker camps increase violence against women in nearby communities. Tensions have risen steadily in recent years. In 2017, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the country’s federal law enforcement agency, formed a special unit called the Community-Industry Response Group to address issues of crime, national security, and public disorder surrounding energy projects in British Columbia — including protests in opposition to Trans Mountain and the Coastal GasLink pipeline, which is being built in a separate part of the province and is being blockaded by the Wet’suwet’en people and their supporters. In October 2019, a C-IRG officer fractured Kanahus Manuel’s wrist, she said, while arresting her on an access road about 37 miles north of the Tiny House Warriors village on charges of intimidation and mischief. An RCMP spokesperson said that following her arrest, Manuel was assessed at the local hospital and taken to a larger hospital, and that no evidence of a broken wrist had been provided to police. The spokesperson also said that a broken bone would trigger an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia, a civilian-led police oversight agency, and that no such investigation was launched. Manuel and a fellow protester were later acquitted of all charges in connection with the incident, and Manuel has filed a federal lawsuit seeking damages. The RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit. The conflict intensified in July 2021 when workers began preparing a swath of forest to make way for a camp that would house up to 550 pipeline personnel for the duration of the Trans Mountain expansion’s construction. As part of that, the workers set up fencing near the Tiny House Warriors village and installed a high-tech surveillance system with cameras that appear to be monitoring the tiny homes, according to civil liberties advocates who visited the site. “This is an area where we walked down to the river for more than three years to offer prayers,” Mayuk Manuel said. “And then they go and clear-cut the area and put us under 24-hour surveillance.” In September 2021, several members of the Tiny House Warriors attempted to create a blockade using a large red cloth to stall semi-trucks hauling logs from the worker camp. On the following day, a security guard contracted by Trans Mountain tackled an unidentified Indigenous woman as she approached a security communications post at the construction site, sparking a melee between the protesters and pipeline security personnel. Videos of the incident obtained by Type Investigations and HuffPost show that in the ensuing scuffle, a security guard forcefully pinned Mayuk Manuel to the ground with his knee. Following a further struggle, she and the other protesters were able to escape. Police later arrested five Indigenous protesters, including Mayuk Manuel, in connection with the incident. The British Columbia crown counsel charged them with varying combinations of assault, assault causing bodily harm, mischief, and other charges. No pipeline workers were arrested or charged in connection with the incident. A Trans Mountain spokesperson said the company “respects the right to peaceful, lawful expressions of opinions,” and that it is “committed to ensuring our workforce demonstrates our core values of safety, integrity, and respect.” However, according to the spokesperson, the protesters had initiated the conflict by breaking through fencing, throwing rocks and debris at workers, and damaging equipment, thereby jeopardizing the safety of workers. “The events of September 15, 2021, were not activities of peaceful protestors but were premeditated attempts to stop work and damage equipment,” the spokesperson said. Trans Mountain says it “strives to be a good neighbor” and ensure that its workers are courteous and respectful to local communities during construction. The Tiny House Warriors, however, view the presence of pipeline personnel at the site as a provocation. “Our direct action happened in self-defense,” Kanahus Manuel said. “This entire situation illustrates exactly why we created our tiny homes village to begin with — to protect against the violence the Canadian government is bringing on our people here, especially our women and two-spirit people.” The Tiny House Warriors’ struggle stems from a two-pronged effort by Indigenous people in Canada to assert authority over their land in recent decades — by strengthening their stature within the country’s legal and political systems, but also outside of them, based on Indigenous values and systems. On the first front, First Nations won rights and protections under the Canadian constitution in the early 1980s, after which many groups began pursuing aggressive legal campaigns to assert sovereign rights and title over their traditional territories. In a seminal 1997 case, the Canadian supreme court affirmed Indigenous groups’ right to claim use and occupation of their land if they could prove they had occupied it before the “assertion of Crown sovereignty,” among other criteria. Another major decision came in 2014 when the supreme court sided with the Tsilhqot’in people over British Columbia after the provincial government granted a commercial logging license on traditional Tsilhqot’in land, further establishing Indigenous ownership of land in British Columbia that First Nations people had not given up via treaty.​ Indigenous groups have used these precedents to mount challenges to similar projects across Canada. In the case of the Trans Mountain expansion, First Nations groups including the Secwepemc have filed a number of legal challenges, arguing that the Canadian government failed to properly consult First Nations and infringed on their land titles when it approved the project. One of these lawsuits, brought by the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and Coldwater First Nations, significantly delayed the start of Trans Mountain’s construction, though the project was ultimately allowed to move forward. Meanwhile, court-ordered injunctions have enabled corporations and the Canadian government to combat on-the-ground resistance to projects like the Trans Mountain expansion, allowing construction and resource extraction to continue while larger legal questions of Aboriginal land title wind their way through the court system. In 2014, a court granted Kinder Morgan’s application for an injunction covering the Trans Mountain expansion. The company had argued that the protests surrounding the project threatened to cause delays and uncertainty, costing the company millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018, the supreme court of British Columbia agreed to grant a new, province-wide injunction forbidding anyone from obstructing or impeding work on the Trans Mountain project and empowering police to arrest anyone who comes within 5 meters (about 16 feet) of the work site. Most people who are found guilty of violating the injunction are subject to seven to 28 days in jail, though in one recent case, prosecutors are seeking up to 60 days of jail time for someone who was convicted of violating the injunction. Even so, Kinder Morgan moved to cancel the project that year, citing opposition to the project from British Columbia’s provincial government, though Indigenous critics of the project say their own opposition played a central part as well. But Trudeau swept in to buy the project for $3.5 billion ($4.5 billion Canadian) in an effort to keep it alive. Miriam Galipeau, a spokesperson for Natural Resources Canada, said the Canadian government considered the environmental, social, and economic impacts the Trans Mountain expansion project would have, including the impact to Indigenous rights and interests, and ultimately determined the project was in the public interest. “Indigenous communities have diverse views about natural resource development in their territories,” Galipeau said. “We respect those diverse views, as well as the right of all people to voice those views in a safe, responsible and lawful way. We are committed to maintaining strong and enduring relationships with Indigenous communities through ongoing dialogue, established relationships and helping communities navigate matters related to accommodation measures, or any other project-related issues.” “No relationship is more important to the government than the one with Indigenous peoples,” Galipeau said. “We recognize that some Indigenous peoples are in support of this project, while others are opposed.” The Trans Mountain spokesperson said the pipeline expansion project has involved “unprecedented levels of involvement, and shared decision making, with Indigenous peoples and communities,” which have led to route changes, new construction techniques, and economic opportunities for local communities. “Through job creation, procurement opportunities, partnerships, and involvement in the environmental management and oversight process, long-term legacy and economic benefits for Indigenous peoples are being created,” the spokesperson said. Indeed, opposition to the project is not uniform among Indigenous people. Some First Nations-led groups are making a play to purchase an equity stake in the pipeline. Meanwhile, according to Trans Mountain, as of November 2021, 67 Indigenous communities along the pipeline route have signed mutual benefit agreements with the company worth $580 million; those agreements often include financial compensation, job training programs, and a role in contract procurement. Simpcw Resources Group, a construction company owned by a Secwepemc band, the Simpcw First Nation, for instance, partnered with construction firm ATCO Structures to operate three pipeline worker camps in interior British Columbia — including the camp that has been contested by the Tiny House Warriors. Nicole Plato, a spokesperson for the Simpcw Resources Group, shared a 2020 joint statement from Simpcw Chief Shelly Loring and Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Chief Rosanne Casimir in which they expressed their support for the Trans Mountain expansion project and called on the Tiny House Warriors to end their protest. “By providing opportunities for our people, we will continue to strengthen our economy in a way that still respects and honors the importance of Mother Earth for future generations,” Loring said in the statement. But some Indigenous leaders who have signed such agreements have publicly insisted that the agreements do not necessarily mean they support the pipeline project. A few have noted that the economic poverty that afflicts native communities makes these deals difficult to pass up, while others have expressed a sense of the project’s inevitability, Vice News reported. However, it is often economic interests, rather than concerns over the environment or land rights, that ultimately win out. One reason injunctions have been so effective in combating Indigenous land claims is that judges base their decisions, in part, on the extent to which each party will be impacted if the project moves ahead — a legal test known as the “balance of convenience.” In a precedent-setting 2004 case, a judge wrote in an opinion that the balance of convenience “tips the scales in favor of protecting jobs and government revenues, with the result that Aboriginal interests tend to ‘lose’ outright pending a final determination of the issue, instead of being balanced appropriately against conflicting concerns.” By and large, courts have viewed energy projects’ potential economic losses as a greater harm than the potential violation of Indigenous rights. Even though Indigenous groups can also apply for injunctions, those efforts have seldom been successful in recent decades. Despite the increasing recognition of Indigenous rights in the courts, judges have granted Indigenous applications for injunctions against corporations only 19%of the time, according to a review of over 100 injunction cases since 1974 from a 2019 report by the Yellowhead Institute. By contrast, an updated August 2020 count shows that courts have granted injunctions against Indigenous people sought by companies and governments 81%and 90%of the time, respectively. The Yellowhead Institute’s research shows that corporations are filing injunctions with increasing frequency. “When considering the injunctions brought before them by resource companies, courts tend not to pay any heed to constitutionally-protected Indigenous land claims,” said Shiri Pasternak, an assistant professor of criminology at Ryerson University and one of the report’s co-authors. These injunctions can often include orders to authorize police enforcement of their terms, leading law enforcement officials to arrest pipeline protesters who violate the court orders. In the past two years alone, police have carried out major operations against a number of Indigenous protest groups, including Haudenosaunee people in Caledonia, Ontario, and Gitxsan people in northern British Columbia, for violating injunctions. Police have disrupted a Wet’suwet’en blockade of the Coastal GasLink pipeline three times since January 2019 — most recently in November 2021. “The incident you are referencing was the RCMP enforcing the Supreme Court injunction, as required by law,” the RCMP spokesperson said in response to a question about these operations. “Enforcing these injunctions are not optional for the RCMP, nor can we delay them indefinitely.” In deciding to grant Coastal GasLink’s requests for injunctions against the Wet’suwet’en people, the judge found that because stopping the pipeline would result in a “loss of employment opportunities” and a loss of tax revenue and economic growth, it passed the balance of convenience test. Molly Wickham (Sleydo’), a Wet’suwet’en opponent of the Coastal GasLink project, said injunctions have become a cudgel that police, energy companies, and Canadian officials have been able to use to force Indigenous people off their rightful land. “[Injunctions] are being used as a tool to eradicate and diminish our rights as Indigenous people and our laws that we are upholding. And as a result, we’re spending time in jail or having to be dragged through this court process that’s costing thousands and thousands of dollars,” she said. The consequences of the conflict over the Trans Mountain pipeline go beyond Indigenous land rights. Environmental experts have long warned that expanding production of the tar sands will lock in further increases in global temperatures, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events at a time when climate change is already wreaking devastation on ecosystems and human societies throughout the globe. British Columbia has been particularly hard hit by extreme weather. Last summer, a “heat dome” caused over 500 heat-related deaths and untold numbers of animals to perish across the province. Then, in November, ferocious storms caused flooding and mudslides across the region, with the costs to repair the damage making it the most expensive climate disaster in British Columbia’s history, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Along the route of the Trans Mountain expansion, construction sites and equipment stockpiles were buried by the November landslides, causing massive delays. In April last year, Trudeau pledged to reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 40% to 45%below 2005 levels by 2030, and Canadian officials say the country is still on track to meet its climate goals. Natural Resources Canada said the revenues generated from the Trans Mountain expansion project will be used to fund Canada’s clean energy transition. “Canada is committed to achieving net-zero by 2050,” said Galipeau, the Natural Resources Canada spokesperson. “Our government has committed to capping emissions from Canada’s oil and gas sector in a way that is compatible with our climate objectives.” But Trans Mountain opponents say the government’s support for the pipeline expansion flies in the face of its environmental commitments. “Someday I’m going to have a hard time explaining to a young person that as climate disasters, wildfires, and heat waves, and landslides and floods raged literally all along the route of this pipeline, a prime minister who claimed to be a climate champion continued to try building a pipeline that would enable a major expansion of this country’s most polluting industry,” said Peter McCartney, a climate campaigner for the Vancouver-based Wilderness Committee, which opposes the project. Climate-induced setbacks, combined with regulatory delays and on-the-ground opposition, including by the Tiny House Warriors, have continued to delay construction of the Trans Mountain expansion and caused its estimated cost to balloon to $16.8 billion ($21.4 billion Canadian) — nearly triple the project’s 2017 estimated price tag of $7.4 billion Canadian. In February 2022, the Trudeau administration announced that it would not provide additional public funding to the project. Instead, it has pledged to secure remaining funds from public debt markets or financial institutions, with a goal of placing the pipeline in operation by fall 2023. According to Politico, however, Trudeau’s cabinet recently approved a $10 billion Canadian loan guarantee for the pipeline after it secured funding from a group of unnamed Canadian financial institutions — though the Department of Finance argued that the move does not reflect new public spending. The worker camp near the Blue River is now open, according to Trans Mountain. For now, residents of the Tiny House Warriors village will continue to resist, despite the injunction. Others are doing so as well. Farther downstream from the Tiny House Warriors encampment, where the Fraser River meets the Pacific Ocean and where the Trans Mountain pipeline sends oil out for export, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and other Indigenous peoples and environmental groups have also been rallying in opposition to the project and pressuring the insurance companies underwriting it — including Liberty Mutual and AIG — to cut ties. So far, 18 major international insurance companies have either chosen to rule out insuring the project or are unable to do so because of their policies. Opponents also plan to continue using blockades and other nonviolent direct actions to slow down the project in hopes of ultimately forcing its cancellation. By standing in the way of the Trans Mountain project, the Tiny House Warriors and other Indigenous groups are following in the footsteps of similar pipeline protest movements across North America. And with the demise of Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Keystone XL in recent years, political momentum seems to be shifting to their side. If the Canadian government similarly decides to throw in the towel on Trans Mountain, it would be a hugely consequential victory for environmentalists, as well as for Indigenous people for whom this conflict is part of a longer-term struggle for self-determination over their ancestral land. “Every day, we are striving to become independent, strong, thriving Indigenous nations,” Kanahus Manuel said. “The power that Indigenous people have is often found in being on the ground, in being out on our land — and that also happens to be the biggest threat to this pipeline.” Investigative journalist"
2,'Like An Inferno:' U.S. West Burning At Furious Pace So Far,environment," LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) — Wildfires are on a furious pace early this year — from a California hilltop where mansions with multimillion-dollar Pacific Ocean views were torched to remote New Mexico mountains charred by a month-old monster blaze. The two places could not be more different, but the elements in common are the same: wind-driven flames have torn through vegetation that is extraordinarily dry from years-long drought exacerbated by climate change. As the unstoppable northern New Mexico wildfire chewed through more dense forest Thursday, firefighters in the coastal community of Laguna Niguel doused charred and smoldering remains of 20 large homes that quickly went up in flames and forced a frantic evacuation. “The sky, everything was orange. It looked like an inferno, so we just jumped in the car,” Sassan Darian said, as he recounted fleeing with his daughter and father while embers swirled around them. “My daughter said, ‘We’re on fire.’ There were sparks on her and we were patting ourselves down.” Nationwide, more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) have burned so far this year — the most at this point since 2018, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Predictions for the rest of the spring do not bode well for the West, with the drought and warmer weather brought on by climate change worsening wildfire danger. “We all know it’s really early for our fire season and we’re all in awe of what we’ve already experienced ... to this point,” said Dave Bales, commander on the New Mexico fire that is the largest burning in the U.S. Fire officials said there was not much they could do in recent days to stop the fast-moving flames burning in tinder-dry forests in the Sangre de Christo range. Fueled by overgrown mountainsides covered with Ponderosa pine and other trees sucked dry of moisture over decades, it’s now burned across more than 405 square miles (1,048 square kilometers) — an area bigger than the city of Dallas, Texas. Crews fighting flames along the mountain fronts between Santa Fe and Taos mostly held their own on Thursday thanks to welcome help from aerial attacks. But fire operations chief Todd Abel said that in some places where winds were gusting over ridgetops, it was “almost like putting a hair dryer on it.” Even small fires that once would have been easily contained are extreme threats to life and property because of climate change, said Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange County Fire Authority. The perfect example broke out Wednesday afternoon when flames that may have been sparked by electric utility equipment were pushed up a canyon by strong sea breezes and quickly ignited large homes. They burned a relatively small area — about 200 acres (81 hectares) — but left a large path of destruction. A sprawling estate selling for $9.9 million had looked in real estate listings like a California dream: teeming with luxuries that included a two-level library, a “wellness wing” with sauna and steam room and a pool on a terrace overlooking scenic Laguna Beach. By nightfall, the mansion once photographed against a pastel sunset had morphed into a nightmare: its arched facade silhouetted against a glowing yellow sky as firefighters trained their hoses on the engulfed structure. After the big flames died down Thursday, the house was one of many smoking casualties marked off with yellow tape. In another driveway, a burned-out car rested on its rims. The steep surrounding hillsides were blackened and stripped of vegetation. Many other homes appeared unscathed and palm trees that had survived the onslaught of embers swayed above in calmer winds. Two firefighters were hospitalized but no other injuries were reported. The fire’s cause was under investigation and damage inspections were still ongoing on Thursday, Orange County Fire Authority Assistant Chief T.J. McGovern said. Southern California Edison reported that unspecified electrical “circuit activity” occurred around the time the fire broke out late Wednesday afternoon. Electric utility equipment has repeatedly been linked to starting some of the most disastrous California wildfires, especially during windy weather. The state Public Utilities Commission last year approved a settlement of more than half a billion dollars in fines and penalties for SoCal Edison for its role in five wildfires in 2017 and 2018. In New Mexico, another red-flag warning was expected to end by Friday night for the first time in a week but extremely low humidity and bone-dry fuels will continue to provide ample opportunity for flames to spread, officials said. “This fire is going to continue to grow,” Bales, the incident commander, warned Thursday night. Residents in four counties east and northeast of Santa Fe remained under a variety of evacuation orders and alerts, and fire officials expected the blaze to continue on a northeast path east of Taos through less-populated areas about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of the Colorado line. With strong spring winds tossing embers into unburned territory, the fire has grown tens of square miles daily since starting April 6 when a prescribed burn intended to clear out brush and small trees — to prevent future fires — got out of control. That fire merged with another wildfire several weeks later. The blaze has burned more than 170 homes so far, but authorities have said that number is expected to increase significantly as more assessments are done and residents are allowed to return home to areas deemed safe.

Some of the ranching and farming families who have called the area home for generations have spoken at length about the sacredness of the landscape, while many others have been too brokenhearted to express what they have lost. ___ Melley reported from Los Angeles.

3,Urine Luck: Michigan Researchers Are Putting The “Pee” In Peony,environment," ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A pair of University of Michigan researchers are putting the “pee” in peony. Rather, they’re putting pee ON peonies. Environmental engineering professors Nancy Love and Krista Wigginton are regular visitors to the Ann Arbor school’s Nichols Arboretum, where they have been applying urine-based fertilizer to the heirloom peony beds ahead of the flowers’ annual spring bloom. It’s all part of an effort to educate the public about their research showing that applying fertilizer derived from nutrient-rich urine could have environmental and economic benefits. “At first, we thought people might be hesitant. You know, this might be weird. But we’ve really experienced very little of that attitude,” Wigginton said. “In general, people think it’s funny at first, but then they understand why we’re doing it and they support it.” Love is co-author of a study published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal that found urine diversion and recycling led to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy. Urine contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus and has been used as a crop fertilizer for thousands of years. Love said collecting human urine and using it to create renewable fertilizers — as part of what she calls the “circular economy of nutrients” — will lead to greater environmental sustainability. Think of it not so much as recycling, but “pee-cycling,” Wigginton said. “We were looking for terms that would catch on but get the idea across, and ‘pee-cycling’ seems to be one that stuck,” she said. As part of a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation awarded in 2016, Love and Wigginton have not only been testing advanced urine-treatment methods, but also investigating people’s attitudes about the use of urine-derived fertilizers. That is what brought them to the much-loved campus Peony Garden, which contains more than 270 historic cultivated varieties from the 19th and early 20th centuries representing American, Canadian and European peonies of the era. The garden holds nearly 800 peonies when filled and up to 10,000 flowers at peak bloom. Love and Wigginton plan to spend weekends in May and June chatting up visitors. One important lesson they learned is about the precision of language. “We have used the term, ‘pee on the peonies.’ And then it grabs people’s attention and then we can talk to them about nutrient flows and nutrient efficiency in our communities and how to be more sustainable,” Love said. “It turns out some people thought that that was permission to drop their drawers and pee on the peonies. “So, this year, we’re going to use ‘pee for the peonies’ and hope that we don’t have that confusion.” The urine-derived fertilizer the researchers are using these days originated in Vermont. But if all goes according to plan, they’ll be doling out some locally sourced fertilizer next year. A split-bowl toilet in a campus engineering building is designed to send solid waste to a treatment plant while routing urine to a holding tank downstairs. Urine diverted from the toilet and urinal were to be treated and eventually used to create fertilizers, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the school to shut down the collection efforts. In the meantime, the facility is undergoing an upgrade to its freeze concentrator and adding a new, more energy-efficient pasteurizer, both developed by the Vermont-based Rich Earth Institute. “The whole idea is cycling within a community, so moving toward that we want to take urine from this community and apply it within this community,” Wigginton said."
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Scientists Grow Plants In Lunar Soil For First Time Ever,environment," CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by NASA’s Apollo astronauts. Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by the next generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them. “Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me?” said Robert Ferl of the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11′s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers. The good news: All of the seeds sprouted. The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted. Results were published Thursday in Communications Biology. The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples — exposed a couple billion years longer to the elements because of the Sea of Tranquility’s older surface — were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists. “This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants,” said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. “The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon.” Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers’ spacesuits. One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting, Only 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews. Some of the earliest moon dust was sprinkled on plants under quarantine with the Apollo astronauts in Houston after returning from the moon. Most of the lunar stash remained locked away, forcing researchers to experiment with simulated soil made of volcanic ash on Earth. NASA finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab. NASA said the timing for such an experiment was finally right, with the space agency looking to put astronauts back on the moon in a few years. The ideal situation would be for future astronauts to tap into the endless supply of available local dirt for indoor planting versus setting up a hydroponic, or all-water, system, scientists said. “The fact that anything grew means that we have a really good starting point, and now the question is how do we optimize and improve,” said Sharmila Bhattacharya, NASA’s program scientist for space biology, The Florida scientists hope to recycle their lunar soil later this year, planting more thale cress before possibly moving on to other vegetation. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

11,"91% Of Surveyed Corals Bleached Along Great Barrier Reef, Australia Says",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY ― More than 90% of coral reefs surveyed along Australia’s Great Barrier Reef were bleached in recent months due to catastrophically warm ocean temperatures, according to a new report by the top government agency monitoring the structure’s health. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority released its “Reef Snapshot” report Tuesday after conducting aerial surveys of the structure following reports it was suffering from mass bleaching earlier this year. Researchers monitored 719 reefs along the eastern coast of Australia, saying 654 of those showed signs of at least some bleaching. Many of those were classified as severely or extremely bleached. “The Great Barrier Reef’s waters warmed early in December 2021, exceeding historical summer maximums that typically occur in the hottest summer months,” the agency said in a release this week. “This prolonged heat exposure led to a mass bleaching of coral across the Great Barrier Reef; the fourth to occur in seven years. Unusually, this was the first mass bleaching event to occur under La Niña conditions.” The marine park authority said Tuesday that scientists had observed some severe bleaching along some surveyed sights, including “completely white colonies” and coral death in areas hit hardest by the warm oceans. The marine park authority first said in March that the iconic structure was undergoing another devastating mass bleaching event, the fourth since 2016, due to abnormally warm ocean temperatures. It’s the first time, however, that a mass bleaching has happened during a La Niña year, when the ocean is supposed to be cooler than usual. Bleaching happens most often when corals are effectively cooked by warmer than usual water, which causes the delicate polyps to turn a sickly white. They can recover if temperatures stabilize, but if the warm water lingers for too long, huge swaths of the reef can die. The report was quietly published Tuesday night, a week after The Sydney Morning Herald reported the document had been delayed until after Australia’s federal election. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority maintained at the time the decision had nothing to do with politics, although scientists and environmentalists criticized the agency for not publishing the findings sooner. The agency’s chief scientist, David Wachenfeld, said there was hope the bleaching wouldn’t lead to widespread death of corals. “The early indications are the mortality won’t be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality,” Wachenfeld told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. But reef advocates have stressed that any mass bleaching event is devastating news. “This was a La Niña year, normally characterized by more cloud cover and rain,” Lissa Schindler, a campaign manger for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told The Guardian. “It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover … This is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced fierce criticism for failing to address climate change, instead throwing his support behind the coal and mining industries. The country has pledged to spend more than $2 billion to protect the structure, but advocates say that figure fails to address the root cause of its demise: our rapidly warming world. Scientists had hoped the season would give corals walloped by frequent bleaching time to recover, but they said the latest event was a “grim” sign for the future of the reef. Instead, some warned that the next strong El Niño summer — when waters are hotter than usual — would be “awful” for the reef. Compared to earlier mass bleaching events, 2022 was more severe than 1998 - then the hottest year on record, and 2002. 2016 (an El Niño summer) remains the most deadly event, killing 30% of corals. 51% died in the north.The next strong El Niño will be awful. https://t.co/4OgAL1fdEx pic.twitter.com/XlMX3tAZ6u Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

13,Dog Rescued From Cage Thrown Into River Finds New Home: 'He Still Loves People',environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A young Michigan dog with a resilient spirit has found a new home after being rescued from a perilous situation. VanBuren, a puppy estimated to be 5 to 6 months old, was picked up by animal control after someone found him “locked in a black wire crate in a river,” Jackson County Animal Shelter spokesperson Lydia Sattler told HuffPost in an email. VanBuren was taken to the shelter, which wrote about his plight last week in a Facebook post that went viral. The shelter noted that “thankfully” someone spotted the cage in the river “before the rains came,” when the water wasn’t too high. The post included a photo showing VanBuren’s leg healing from a “nasty break” that he had when he was found. He also had “several abrasions,” Sattler added. But the trauma he’d been through apparently didn’t dampen the puppy’s loving spirit. “He is absolutely a wiggle bottom and full of kisses for everyone,” Sattler said. The shelter’s post also noted that VanBuren “still loves people” and aspires to be the “best doggo ever.” His sweet attitude is likely a big reason it didn’t take long for him to find a home. On Monday, Sattler said VanBuren had been adopted and shared a happy photo of the pup with his new family. Congrats, VanBuren! Assignment editor, HuffPost"
14,"In Drought-Ravaged California, Water Use Is Up Dramatically",environment," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Californian’s drought is worsening and yet residents used more water in March than any month since 2015, defying pleas for conservation from Gov. Gavin Newsom and other authorities, state officials announced Tuesday. Water usage jumped nearly 19% in March, which was one of the driest months on record. Newsom last summer asked residents to voluntarily cut water use by 15%. He encouraged people to water their yards less often, run dishwashers less and install more efficient appliances. The state’s conservation rate gradually increased, aided by some intense fall and early winter storms that reduced water demand. But the first three months of 2022 have been some of the driest ever recorded. Water use increased slightly in January and February before exploding in March when compared to 2020 figures. Since July, the state has cut its overall water use by just 3.7%. Newsom responded to the news by pledging to spend an extra $26 million on water conservation programs, in addition to the $190 million he proposed in January. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced residents and businesses would have to reduce outdoor landscape watering from three days per week to two. Irrigation makes up 35% of the city’s water use. A series of April storms have improved things slightly since March. Still, most of the state’s reservoirs are well below their historic averages. Those reservoirs rely on melting snow to fill up for the dry summer months but the statewide snowpack was at just 27% of its historic average as of April 1."

0,Everybody Clap! Endangered Seal Species Hits Comeback Milestone,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost One of the world’s most endangered seal species has some flippin’ good news. The population of Hawaiian monk seals, an animal found in the wild only in Hawaii, has surpassed 1,500 seals, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced this week. That’s higher than their numbers have been in more than 20 years, which is good news not only for them, but for the environment as a whole. “If we have healthy monk seals, we know that the ecosystem that is supporting those animals is healthy and thriving,” Michelle Barbieri, lead scientist with the NOAA’s monk seal research program, told The Associated Press. The expressive-faced creatures are up against a slew of threats. A big one is habitat loss caused by climate change, as rising sea levels swallow up the low-lying landmasses where the seals live. Other dangers include getting tangled up in fishing nets and other marine debris, eating harmful trash like fishing hooks, diseases, disturbances from human activity on beaches, and even some people intentionally killing them. “We are out there ourselves and working with partners to conduct life-saving interventions for seals, prioritizing females, which are going to go on to create the future generation of seals,” Barbieri told the AP. “We’re starting to really see that continued payoff of intervening to save animals’ lives.” In the Hawaiian language, monk seals are called ilio-holo-i-ka-uaua, which translates to “dog running in the rough water.” The marine mammals can grow between 6 and 7 feet long and weigh 400-600 pounds, feeding on a wide array of fish, octopus, squid, crustaceans and eels. On occasion, those eels cause their own kind of trouble, sometimes getting stuck in seals’ noses. Thankfully, all the seals the NOAA has encountered with this highly specific problem have been OK in the end. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
1,Elephant's 'Excellent Mothering Skills' Help Rare Twins Defy The Odds To Survive,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A pair of elephant twins experts weren’t sure would survive are alive and well thanks to the dedication and skill of their mother. The twins, one male and one female, were born in January to a mother named Bora at Samburu National Reserve in Kenya. At the time, the nonprofit Save the Elephants ― which has researchers working in the park and also collaborates with local guides to monitor the animals ― expressed cautious hope about the twins’ future. Twins are rare among elephants and their survival can be dicey. Famed biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough previously called the task of raising elephant twins “almost impossible” because calves “need so much milk and care.” But more than four months later, Bora’s babies are “tiny but still doing well,” Save the Elephants spokesperson Jane Wynyard told HuffPost in an email. “Miraculously Bora has managed to keep her babies alive against all odds and through a fierce drought,” she said. “It’s still early days for the twins and they will rely on their mother’s milk until they’re over 2 years old. However, their survival so far is testament to Bora’s excellent mothering skills and the resilience of elephants.” The twins were spotted late last month and can be seen with Bora and the herd in a video on the nonprofit’s Facebook page.

2,A New Trump-Tied PAC Has Entered The Right-Wing War Against Biden’s Conservation Goals,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A new political action committee run by two former Trump administration officials is marking its territory in a disinformation-rich campaign against the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.” Sagebrush Rebellion PAC, named after the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement that started in the 1970s and sought to remove lands from federal control, quietly surfaced late last year. It has deep connections to Trumpworld and has joined a growing coalition of right-wing organizations and elected officials sowing fear in rural communities with false, conspiratorial claims about how Biden’s government is planning to confiscate private property or use deceptive tactics to gain control of private land to meet the 30x30 target. On its cowboy-heavy website, Sagebrush Rebellion boasts of being “made up of grassroots fighters who are not beholden to Washington’s inner circles” and says it is “committed to gutting incompetent and corrupt leaders from the political process.” Its priorities include dismantling federal land management agencies and transferring control of federal lands to the states, as well as a laundry list of fossil fuel-centric energy policies that looks like something pulled directly from an oil and gas trade group’s website. The PAC’s donations page urges people to “help us start a rebellion.” It sells T-shirts, mugs and other merchandise that feature a cow skull and the phrase “Let’s Go Brandin’,” a cowboy twist on a popular conservative phrase meaning “Fuck Joe Biden.” Internet archives show that in 2015 the website URL that Sagebrush Rebellion PAC is now using featured a post titled “Simple Wisdom of Cliven Bundy,” the notorious Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff with federal agents in 2014 over unpaid grazing fees. As HuffPost reported this story, the PAC and a film company it is working with on a documentary purged their social media accounts of specific posts in the exact order that HuffPost inquired about them. As of March 31, the fledgling PAC had received only $200 in contributions, according to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. But it recently started forging relationships with some of the biggest players in the anti-30x30 push. The PAC sponsored last month’s “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska. On Twitter, the group has parroted the anti-30x30 movement’s sweeping, evidence-free claim that the 30x30 target is a federal “land grab” in disguise. The greatest conservationists in the country are farmers & ranchers. The Biden Administration has declared war on their private property rights with its dismal 30x30 land grab. Let the power over land remain in the hands of the people who work it, not bureaucrats. #Stop30x30 The group is based in Casper, Wyoming, and led by Rockefeller heiress and Donald Trump loyalist Catharine P. O’Neill, the daughter of major Republican donor George O’Neill Jr. She worked at both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration and is a regular contributor to far-right news outlet Newsmax. Trump 2024 pic.twitter.com/e2LfJ4cBWc Christian Whiton, a former adviser to the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, is the PAC’s ​​director of communications. O’Neill and Whiton have both peddled baseless claims about fraud in the 2020 election and questioned the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency. On a leaked call with USAID staff two days after Biden was announced the winner, O’Neill declared that “the election is still happening” and “the Electoral College has not voted yet.” And on Jan. 6, 2021, after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of the 2020 election, O’Neill went on Twitter to proclaim her alliance to Trump and condemn those not standing behind him. I have been with President @realDonaldTrump since the beginning and will stand with him until the end.To my colleagues in the Administration who are not doing the same: your masks are off, we see you, we will remember you. #2022 Along with sponsoring last month’s “Stop 30x30 Summit,” Sagebrush Rebellion PAC has teamed up with an Arizona-based production company, J Infinite Digital Media, to produce some sort of documentary starring the leading figures of the anti-30x30 movement. In a now-deleted post on Instagram, J Infinite shared pictures of the production company and Sagebrush Rebellion PAC filming at last month’s event. “An amazing production day with @sagebrushrebellion on their latest doc project,” read the post, which included pictures of film production and an interview with Margaret Byfield, executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, a fringe right-wing property rights group in Texas that organized the summit and is leading the fight against 30x30. Jackson Carter of Sagebrush Rebellion was tagged in the post. The post also featured Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), one of the summit’s keynote speakers, and Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman (R), who was convicted in 2015 of leading anti-federal land protesters on an illegal ATV ride on public lands that were off limits to off-road vehicles. Trump later pardoned Lyman’s federal misdemeanor conviction. J Infinite removed the Instagram post within a couple hours of HuffPost contacting Sagebrush Rebellion PAC about it. Accountable.US, a watchdog group, first alerted HuffPost to Sagebrush Rebellion PAC and its forthcoming documentary project. “When it comes to American Stewards of Liberty, you can almost hear the black helicopters circling,” Jordan Schreiber, energy and environment director at Accountable.US, told HuffPost in an email. She noted that the group’s leaders have compared 30x30 to Nazi Germany and the Holodomor, a human-caused famine that occurred in Ukraine during Soviet dictator Josef Stalin’s rule that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3.9 million people. “This is what we are up against in the fight to preserve American land and water for future generations to enjoy,” Schreiber said. The documentary project appears to be far and away the biggest job this little-known film outfit has landed. A review of J Infinite’s website indicates its specialty is filming and photographing people shooting and posing with guns. Two of its main clients are tactical training facilities in Arizona, one of which J Infinite’s owner Jacob Fuchs also works for. Fuchs seems to have some sort of affiliation with or affinity for the Boogaloo Bois, an often violent far-right, anti-government movement that has warned of and even plotted a future civil war. Members often sport Hawaiian shirts and military-style gear. Last June, J Infinite released a nearly three-minute, slow-motion video titled “Da Bois,” featuring Fuchs and two other men in tactical gear shooting assault-style rifles and handguns and fist-bumping to The Chords’ song “Sh-Boom.” Vests worn by Fuchs and another man feature patches that read “BOOG CREW.” Another similar video posted on the company’s YouTube channel is titled “Boogaloo Crew Pilot.” Two days after the anti-30x30 summit in Nebraska, Sagebrush Rebellion posted a picture on Twitter of what appears to be Fuchs in a Hawaiian shirt with the caption, “Behind the scenes…stay tuned!” Neither J Infinite nor Sagebrush Rebellion PAC responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment about the documentary they are working on or the production company’s Boogaloo-themed videos. A series of emails to Joshua Abernathy, whose address is listed on the PAC’s filings with the FEC, garnered only a brief reply: “I am no longer working on that project.” After HuffPost reached out to J Infinite, the company deleted its Boogaloo-themed content from YouTube, took down its website and made its Instagram page private. And immediately after HuffPost asked if the man pictured in the Hawaiian shirt was Fuchs, Sagebrush Rebellion took down the post and blocked this reporter on Twitter. It is unclear how Fuchs and his company went from filming Boogaloo-themed target practices to a documentary for a PAC run by former Trump administration officials, or to what extent American Stewards of Liberty is involved in the project. Byfield did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. American Stewards is largely responsible for the false narrative about 30x30 being a government land grab. The organization was formed in 2009, but it has its roots in the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement. One of its precursors, Stewards of the Range, was established in 1992 to defend Byfield’s father, Nevada rancher and sagebrush rebel Wayne Hage, who battled with the Forest Service for years over unpermitted grazing on public lands — a prequel of sorts to the Bundy standoff that gave rise to an extremist militia movement. Byfield has worked to distance her organization from the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Bundy family. In a June 2021 email to a Nebraska reporter, which HuffPost obtained as part of a public records request, Byfield wrote that her group “was founded in the 1990s so we couldn’t have had an association with the sagebrush rebellion” and that her father “was not part of the sagebrush rebellion.” She also said American Stewards has never been associated with Bundy. Yet Byfield allowed a PAC named after the Sagebrush Rebellion that shares the movement’s anti-federal land ideology to sponsor and film an anti-30x30 summit that she called “the most important conference” her group has ever organized. And Trent Loos, a Nebraska rancher and radio show host who served on Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and now helps American Stewards with its anti-30x30 campaign, conducted a sympathetic interview with Bundy’s son, Ammon Bundy, during the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. In closing remarks at last month’s summit in Nebraska, which HuffPost obtained a recording of, Byfield took a moment to thank and recognize the event’s sponsors. “Catharine O’Neill, the Sagebrush Rebellion,” Byfield said to the audience. “Have you guys been doing any interviews with Catharine? She’s set up in the media room.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Ukraine's Scientists Keep Working In Defiance Of Russian Invasion,environment," Anton Vlaschenko often hears shelling outside his office in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, not far from the front lines of the war. He sometimes even sees smoke rising from Russian tanks hit by missiles. But the 40-year-old zoologist continues his work, dissecting and labeling bat tissue, as he probes the disease ecology of the flying mammals. When news of the war overwhelms him, he says, it helps to have something familiar to do with his hands. He also sees it as an act of defiance. “Our staying in Ukraine, our continuing to work — it’s some kind of resistance of Russian invasion,” Vlaschenko said via Zoom, a barrage of shelling audible in the background. “The people together in Ukraine are ready to fight, not only with guns. We don’t want to lose our country.” His resolve isn’t unique. Like other Ukrainians whose labors aren’t essential to the war effort, the scientists and academics want to continue their important work where they can. A common refrain is that they want to stay connected to their scholarly community, which provides a shard of normalcy amid the chaos and violence, and “keep the light of Ukrainian science and humanities alive,” said Yevheniia Polishchuk, who teaches at Kyiv National Economic University. As vice chair of the Young Scientists Council at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science, Polishchuk organized an online survey of academics to assess their situation and needs after the Feb. 24 invasion. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 scholars had left Ukraine by early April — mostly women with families — but about 100,000 stayed. Most who went abroad wound up in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, getting temporary positions at European institutions. Some scientists have received grants from the Polish Academy of Sciences, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and other organizations. Polishchuk, now in Krakow with her children and husband, is a visiting professor at a university for May and June but says she hopes to return to Kyiv when fighting stops. “We don’t want the war to result in a brain drain from Ukraine,” she said. While Ukrainian scholars are appealing to international scientific bodies for assistance — including remote work opportunities and access to journals, datasets, archives and other materials — there is also a will to prevent the war from permanently sapping talent and momentum from the country’s academic and professional ranks, which will be needed to rebuild after fighting stops. “Most of our scholars do not want to move abroad permanently; they want to stay in Ukraine,” Polishchuk said. Shortly after the war began, Ivan Slyusarev, a 34-year-old astronomer, helped the director of Kharkiv National University’s observatory move computers, monitors and other materials into the basement, which had sheltered equipment and historical artifacts when Nazi forces occupied the city during World War II. The observatory’s main telescope is located in a field in Russia-occupied territory, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Kharkiv on the road to Donetsk. Slyusarev said he doesn’t know its condition, but thinks Ukrainian forces blew up a nearby bridge to stop the Russian advance. He is relying on scientists outside Ukraine to continue his work. Astronomers in the Czech Republic have sent him observational data from their telescope so he can keep analyzing the properties of metallic asteroids. He also can see data from a small robotic telescope in Spain’s Canary Islands. He operates mostly from a home office on the outskirts of Kharkiv. Slyusarev, who says he became an astronomer because of “romantic” ideas about the stars, finds refuge in scientific discovery. Astronomy “produces only positive news” and is a welcome respite from daily life, he said. “It’s very important in wartime,” he added. After the war started, theoretical physicist and astronomer Oleksiy Golubov left Kharkiv to join his parents in Batkiv, a village in western Ukraine. Although the buildings of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology were “bombed and shelled and virtually destroyed,” Golubov said, the school continues to offer some remote classes. He has been keeping in touch with students online — in Kharkiv, in western Ukraine and in Poland and Germany. The 36-year-old scientist is also a coordinator and trainer for the Ukrainian students preparing to compete in the International Physicists Tournament, a competition for tackling unsolved physics problems that is being held in Colombia this month. The students, who had been training online, met this week in Lviv for the first time — following train journeys delayed by the war. “We still want to take part and prove that even inconveniences like war can’t stop us from doing good science and having a good education,” he said. Golubov, who was turned down from joining the military because of a paralyzed hand, submitted a paper in March to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics and wrote in the acknowledgements, “We are grateful to Ukrainians who are fighting to stop the war so that we can safely finish the revision of this article.” Some scholars, like Ivan Patrilyak, dean of the history department at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, have enlisted. Eighteen months ago, he was hosting a speaker series on the legacy of World War II and lecturing about the Holocaust. Now, he’s with a territorial defense unit in Kyiv. Igor Lyman, a historian at the State Pedagogical University in Berdyansk, had to flee when Russian forces occupied the port city early in the war. Before leaving, he had seen the troops break into dormitories to interrogate students and order administrators to teach in Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and use a Moscow-approved curriculum. He said the directors “refused and resigned.” He later settled in a camp for internally displaced persons at Chernivtsi National University, living in a dormitory with academics from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and other cities. “Each of these families has its own terrible story of war,” he wrote in an email. “And everyone, like me, dreams of our victory and coming back home.” He said the Russian forces “are doing everything they can to impose their propaganda.” Vlaschenko, the Kharkiv zoologist, wanted to protect 20 bats in his care from the shelling, so he carried them to his home, a walk of about an hour. It also helped to preserve his valuable research, which couldn’t be easily replaced, even if buildings and labs can be rebuilt after the war. “All the people who decided to stay in Kharkiv agreed to play this dangerous and potentially deadly lottery,” he said, “because you never know in what areas a new rocket or new shell would hit.” As he scrambles to record data and safeguard his rare samples, he sees it as part of his mission — “not only for us, but also for science in general.” The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what? Others pointed out that innocent people rarely request pardons. Wow. Congressmen helping Trump on & before 1/6 & then demanding pardons. Makes me think of 18 USC 201: A public official who corruptly seeks anything of value in return for an official act or colluding in fraud shall be imprisoned for up to 15 years & disqualified from office Hi Matt. Why did you ask for a pardon?

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Dog Found Tied To Hydrant With Bag Of 'Favorite Things' Is Now 'Doing Great',environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Things are looking up for a sweet dog in Wisconsin who was recently found tied to a fire hydrant in a Green Bay neighborhood alongside a backpack full of dog supplies and a pleading note from her previous owner. “The note indicated that her name was ‘Baby Girl’ and her owner was having serious medical issues and could no longer care for her,” Angela Speed, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Humane Society, told HuffPost in an email. “The note asked that someone please help Baby Girl.” The large backpack placed beside Baby Girl was filled with food, toys and treats, according to WFRV, a regional CBS affiliate. A woman passing by, Kylie Rose Engelhart, spotted Baby Girl on Sunday and snapped a photo of the dog waiting by the hydrant. Engelhart waited with Baby Girl in case someone came back for her, but ultimately brought her to the WHS’ Green Bay shelter. Baby Girl’s story has been getting attention not only for the heartbreaking photo, which went viral, but because of a moving Facebook post from the animal rescue organization. The post begins by updating the public on Baby Girl, saying she is “doing great” in the shelter’s care. “As her story gains attention locally and beyond, we wanted to take a moment to address Baby Girl’s previous owner directly,” the post reads. “First and foremost, we are so sorry you had to part with your best friend,” it continues. “It’s evident just how much you loved her and we can see you did your best while struggling with your own medical complications and challenges of life.” The shelter lists the reasons why it seems clear that Baby Girl’s former owner was trying to do what they felt was best for their beloved dog. “We see your love in the bag you carefully packed with all of her favorite things,” the shelter’s post reads. “We see your love in the way you secured her leash so she wouldn’t get hit by a car. We see your love in the way you placed her in the middle of a neighborhood where she’d be quickly found. We see your love in how happy and healthy Baby Girl looks. And we see your love in the note you left, pleading for someone to help her when you no longer could.” That said, the WHS urged people who can no longer care for pets to bring them to a shelter rather than leave them outside. “You will be met at the door with the same compassion and respect that we bring to animals in our care,” Speed said. “We never want anyone to hesitate to seek our services.” Engelhart told HuffPost she has “no ill will” toward Baby Girl’s former owner, and that she wants “everyone to focus on the love for Baby Girl and finding her a new loving home she can thrive in!” That likely won’t be difficult for Baby Girl, who’s about 6 years old and “affectionate and delightful,” according to Speed. “She’s a happy girl who loves to go for walks, play with toys, and gets super excited to perform a perfect ‘sit’ for treats,” Speed said. Baby Girl will likely be up for adoption in “the coming days” after she clears some additional veterinary checks. In the meantime, the shelter hopes her former owner sees the Facebook post and knows their dog is in good hands. “We wish you all the best and hope that if you see this, you can rest a little easier knowing your Baby Girl has a bright future ahead,” the Facebook post reads.

11,A Whole Lot Of Dams In The United States Are At Risk Of Failing,environment," Constructed four generations ago, the massive rock and clay dam at El Capitan Reservoir is capable of storing over 36 billion gallons of water, enough to supply every resident in San Diego for most of a year. Today, it’s three-quarters empty, intentionally kept low because of concerns it could fail under the strain of too much water. During “a big earthquake, you never know what’s going to happen, if this is going to hold,” said Samuel Santos, a longtime resident who frequently fishes near the dam. Seismic instability and a spillway in need of “significant repair” led El Capitan to be added to a growing list of dams rated in poor condition or worse that would likely cause deaths downstream if they failed. An Associated Press analysis tallied more than 2,200 high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition across the U.S. — up substantially from a similar AP review conducted three years ago. The actual number is likely even higher, although it’s unclear because some states don’t track such data and many federal agencies refuse to release details about their dams’ conditions. The nation’s dams are on average over a half-century old and often present more of a hazard than envisioned when designed because homes, businesses or highways have cropped up below them. Meanwhile, a warming atmosphere can bring stronger storms  with heavier rainfall that could overwhelm aging dams. “All of a sudden, you’ve got older dams with a lower design criteria that now can potentially cause loss of life if they fail,” said Del Shannon, an engineer who is president of the U.S. Society on Dams. “The number of deficient, high-hazard dams is increasing,” he said, adding that without investment in upgrades, that number will continue to rise. Decades of deferred maintenance has worsened the problem. But a changing climate and extreme floods — such as the one that caused the failure of two Michigan dams  and the evacuation of 10,000 people in 2020 — have brought a renewed focus to an often overlooked aspect of America’s critical infrastructure. The $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed last year by President Joe Biden will pump about $3 billion into dam-related projects, including hundreds of millions for state dam safety programs and repairs. It marks “a tremendous leap and jump of funding,” said Kayed Lakhia, director of the National Dam Safety Program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Yet it’s still just a fraction of the nearly $76 billion needed to fix the almost 89,000 dams owned by individuals, companies, community associations, state and local governments, and other entities besides the federal government,  according to a report by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. ___ The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lists about 92,000 dams in its nationwide database, most of which are privately owned and regulated by states. Dams are classified according to the risk posed by failure, ranging from low to significant to high. A high hazard means lives could be lost if the dam fails. Dams also are assessed by their condition. Those in the worst shape — categorized as poor or unsatisfactory — can have a variety of problems including cracks and erosion that could undermine a dam, or spillway outlets unable to release all the water after extraordinary rainfall. The number of high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition has risen partly because of stricter regulation. Some state programs, infused with millions of additional dollars, have stepped up inspections, reassessed whether old dams endanger new downstream developments and worked to identify dams long ago abandoned by their owners. Some also are updating the precipitation tools used to evaluate the risks. New York has about twice the number of high-hazard dams in poor condition as it did in 2018, when the AP collected data for its earlier analysis. The increase came as officials pushed to assess all high-hazard dams that were previously unrated. The number of high-hazard dams in deficient condition in South Carolina rose by a third from 2018 to 2021, after lawmakers more than doubled annual funding for the state’s dam safety program. More than 70 dams failed in the state amid heavy rains in 2015  and 2016. Since then, South Carolina has ramped up staffing, undertaken more regular inspections and begun mapping potential flood zones for low-hazard dams to determine if they should be reclassified as high hazard. “When you had a storm of that magnitude and you have it happen again the next year, and dams continue to fail, we’ve got to be able to provide a response,” said Jill Stewart, the state’s director of dam safety and stormwater permitting. Rhode Island examined the capacity of all its dam spillways after five dams failed during a storm in 2010. A 2019 study found that a quarter of its high-hazard dams couldn’t hold up to a 100-year storm — an event with a 1% chance of happening any year — and 17% couldn’t pass a 500-year storm, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in a year. The state was sharing the findings with dam owners and could require some to upgrade their spillways to meet state regulations. Many old dams “are undersized for the kind of storms that we’re getting today and will be getting in the future,” said David Chopy, administrator of the Office of Compliance and Inspection at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Since 2019, California regulators have downgraded four of San Diego’s water supply dams from fair to poor condition because of deterioration and concerns they could fail because of an earthquake or extraordinary rainfall. As a result, the high-hazard dams at El Capitan, Hodges and Morena reservoirs all are restricted to holding less than half their capacities. The dam at Lower Otay Reservoir, also high hazard and in poor condition, is not restricted. The lower water means Santos, who has been coming to El Capitan Reservoir since childhood, can’t find relief from shade trees when he fishes from the receding banks. His children don’t want to join him because it’s so hot. “It’s sad to see it, because it’s just like a duck pond compared to what it used to be,” said another longtime resident, Bob Neal, who said his father-in-law helped build the dam in the 1930s. The dam’s poor condition also means less water is stored to prepare for drought, which has become particularly severe in the West. San Diego gets an average of just 10 inches of rain annually. “These reservoirs are very important,” said Republican state Sen. Brian Jones, whose district includes the El Capitan and Lake Hodges dams. “We need to start spending the money on them to retrofit them, to get them up again back to full capacity.” Jones is among several lawmakers pushing the state to carry out a 2014 ballot proposition that authorized billions of dollars for reservoir projects. San Diego’s mayor also has urged the state to allot at least $3 billion for dam repairs statewide. ___ For many dams, problems develop gradually and risks can be reduced by temporary measures, such as lowering water levels, until repairs can be made, said Ryan Stack, chief engineer at Missouri’s dam safety program. “Unsatisfactory doesn’t necessarily mean helicopters and bells-and-whistles and everything going off for an immediate crisis,” Stack said. But the risk from old, inadequate dams has become painfully evident in recent years. In 2019, a rural Nebraska dam failed under extreme pressure from a raging flood of ice chunks, killing a man whose home was beneath the dam. An independent investigation determined that state regulators should have classified the dam as “high hazard,” which could have led to a plan to increase its flood capacity and better warn residents downstream. The public utility that owned the dam agreed this year to a $2.5 million settlement for the man’s family while a lawsuit continues against the state. In 2020, central Michigan’s Edenville Dam failed following heavy rainfall. The rupture unleashed a torrent on the Tittabawassee River, leading to the failure of Sanford Dam downstream and the evacuation of about 10,000 people. The high-hazard Edenville Dam, built in 1924, had been rated in unsatisfactory condition in 2018 and lost its federal hydropower license due to a variety of issues, including a spillway incapable of standing up to a severe flood. An investigatory report released Wednesday found that Edenville dam had deficiencies with its earthen embankment that could have been been caught and corrected if engineers had gone beyond visual inspections and conducted a more comprehensive review of the dam’s design and construction. Regulators across the country should learn from the Michigan failures, said John France, an engineer who led the investigation. “No one has X-ray eyes,” France said Thursday. “You would have to look at the records, you would have to look at the test borings that were done and assimilate that all together.” After the dam failures, Michigan beefed up its 2022 budget with $19 million for dam safety, plus money to hire more regulatory staff. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently signed legislation providing an additional $250 million for dams, including about $200 million to repair those damaged by the 2020 floods. The plan prioritizes high-risk dams “that can be ticking time bombs if they are not addressed,” said state Rep. Roger Hauck, a Republican whose district experienced flooding from the dam failures. “Dragging our feet or failing to get it done will only open the door to other catastrophes down the line.” Other states also are pumping more money into dam safety. After Kansas exempted thousands of dams from state regulation in 2013, its allotment of annual federal dam safety funds plunged, leading to a decline in staffing and delays in handling permits and inspections. A budget passed by the Legislature this year will double state funding and staff for the dam safety office. Facing a projected 20-year backlog of work, Missouri lawmakers last year added $75,000 to hire an additional dam safety engineer. But it’s taken 10 months to find someone qualified to fill the position. Addressing the problems posed by old, unsafe dams can be challenging. Repairs can be costly and take years to complete. Attempts to remove dams — and empty the lakes they hold back — can spawn legal battles and a public outcry from those who rely on them for recreation or to sustain nearby property values. A pair of high-hazard dams built in the mid-1800s near Cleveland are among those in need of major repair. Upper Shaker Lake, commonly known as Horseshoe Lake, was drained as a precaution after it developed sinkholes and cracks. The cities of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights, which jointly manage the dams, last year approved a $28.3 million plan to remove Horseshoe Lake Dam, return the area to a free-flowing stream and rebuild Lower Shaker Lake Dam. But the plan faces backlash from community members who formed a nonprofit to try to save Horseshoe Lake. They hired a law firm and engineering company, launched a fundraising drive and gathered about 2,000 online petition signatures. “The lake is a beautiful, calming feature that is the central park of the Heights neighborhood,” said musician Bert Stratton, a resident helping to lead the efforts. “It’s where people come to congregate, and they have for over 100 years.” The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, which manages stormwater projects, said Horseshoe Lake provides little flood-control benefit and that the district won’t pay to rebuild it. “People need to understand there is a major risk at this facility,” including the “probable loss of life if the dam blew out,” said Frank Greenland, the district’s director of watershed programs. Decades of procrastination on repairs has led to the deterioration of other dams across the country. Some owners find it difficult to justify the costs of improving structures without facing an emergency. There’s an attitude among some dam owners of “oh, we’ll take care of it next year; oh, we’ll take care of it in three years; oh, let’s put together a plan,” said Bob Travis, managing partner of Risk Management Matters LLC, a consultant for community associations. “Meanwhile, that dam is getting older and older and older.” ___ Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri; Casey from Boston; and Minkoff from Washington, D.C.

12,Firefighters Slow Huge New Mexico Wildfire As Biden Declares Disaster,environment," LAS VEGAS, N.M. (AP) — Firefighters slowed the advance of the largest wildfire in the U.S. as heavy winds relented Wednesday, while President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration that brings new financial resources to remote stretches of New Mexico devastated by fire since early April. U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez announced the presidential disaster declaration during an evening briefing by the U.S. Forest Service about efforts to contain the sprawling wildfire in northeastern New Mexico. It has fanned out across 258 square miles (669 square kilometers) of high alpine forest and grasslands at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. “It will help us do that rebuilding and it will help us with the expenses and the hardship that people are facing right now,” the congresswoman said. “We’re glad it happened this quickly.” Fire bosses are seizing upon an interlude of relatively calm and cool weather to prevent the fire from pushing any closer to the small New Mexico city of Las Vegas and other villages scattered along the fire’s shifting fronts. Airplanes and helicopters dropped slurries of red fire retardant from the sky, as ground crews cleared timber and brush to starve the fire along crucial fronts. Bulldozers for days scraped fire lines on the outskirts of Las Vegas, population 13,000, while crews have conducted controlled burning to clear adjacent vegetation to prevent it from igniting. Aircraft dropped more fire retardant as a second line of defense along a ridge just west of Las Vegas in preparation for intense winds expected over the weekend. Strong winds with gusts up to 45 mph (72 kph) are expected to return Saturday afternoon along with above-normal temperatures and “abysmally low” humidity that make for extreme fire danger, said Todd Shoemake, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albuquerque. “Sunday and Monday are probably looking to be even worse.” Nearly 1,300 firefighters and other personnel were assigned to the fire. Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for an estimated 15,500 homes in outlying areas and in the valleys of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains that border Las Vegas. The tally of homes destroyed by the fire stands around 170 but could grow higher because officials have not been able to conduct assessment in all of the burn zones. Biden’s disaster declaration releases emergency funds to recovery efforts in three counties in northeastern New Mexico where fires are still raging and for southern New Mexico areas where wind-driven blazes killed two people and destroyed over 200 homes in mid-April. The aid includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other relief programs for people and businesses, a White House statement said. Local law enforcement officials acknowledged the physical and emotion toll of the prolonged evacuations. Las Vegas Police Chief Antonio Salazar said his officers would provide “burglary patrols” for evacuated areas and help to maintain order at a local Walmart as people line up to purchase supplies. “Repopulation, that’s one thing we’re very interested in,” San Miguel County Sheriff Chris Lopez said. “Everybody wants to get back home.” Dan Pearson, a fire behavior specialist with the federal government, said weather forecasters predict two days of relatively light winds before the return of strong spring gales. “Our prayers are working because we’ve had advantageous winds throughout the fire area today,” he said. “We’ll take advantage of this fact over the next few days. ... What we can do is build resilient pockets.” The fire was contained across just 20% of its perimeter. Its flames were about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away from Las Vegas, where schools were closed as residents braced for possible evacuation. Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory were warily tracking another wildfire that crept within about 5 miles (8 kilometers) of facilities at the U.S. nuclear research complex. Fire crews worked to widen a road that stands between the fire and Los Alamos while clearing out underbrush and treating the area with fire retardant. Wildfires have become a year-round threat in the drought-stricken West — moving faster and burning hotter than ever due to climate change, scientists and fire experts have said. Fire officials also point to overgrown areas where vegetation can worsen wildfire conditions. ___ Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

13,California Condors Take Wing Over Coastal Redwoods For The First Time In A Century,environment," REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) — The endangered California condor returned to soar the skies over the state’s far northern coast redwood forests on Tuesday for the first time in more than a century. Two captive-bred birds were released from a pen in Redwood National Park, about an hour’s drive south of the Oregon border, under a project aimed at restoring the giant vultures to their historic habitat in the Pacific Northwest. The two male condors were moved into staging area at late morning and a remotely controlled gate was opened. After a few minutes of warily eyeing the opening, the birds stepped one by one through the opening, spread their giant wings and took off. “They just jumped up and took flight off into the distance,” Tiana Williams-Claussen, wildlife director for the region’s Yurok tribe, said in a webcast. Condors were last spotted in the park area around 1892, authorities said. The California condor is the largest native North American bird, with a wingspan of nearly 10 feet (3 meters). The scavenger was once widespread but had virtually disappeared by the 1970s because of poaching, lead poisoning from eating animals shot by hunters and destruction of its habitat. The birds can live for 60 years and fly vast distances in search of carrion, so their range could extend into several states. Federal and local fish and wildlife agencies are involved in the restoration project headed by the Yurok tribe, which traditionally has considered the California condor a sacred animal and has been working for years to return the species to the tribe’s ancestral territory. “For countless generations, the Yurok people have upheld a sacred responsibility to maintain balance in the natural world. Condor reintroduction is a real-life manifestation of our cultural commitment to restore and protect the planet for future generations,” tribal Chairman Joseph L. James said in a statement. Two more condors were set to be released later — after biologists determine that the two birds who took to the skies Tuesday have displayed appropriate behavior, authorities said. The condors, including one female and three males, are between 2 and 4 years old. Two were hatched at the Oregon Zoo and two at the Peregrine Fund’s World Center for Birds of Prey in Idaho. In the early 1980s, all 22 condors remaining in the wild were trapped and brought into a captive-breeding program that began releasing the giant vultures into Southern California’s Los Padres National Forest in 1992. That flock has been expanding its range while other condors now occupy parts of California’s Central Coast, Arizona, Utah and Baja California, Mexico. The total population now numbers more than 500 birds in captivity and in the wild. Two years ago, California condors were spotted in Sequoia National Park, in California’s Sierra Nevada, for the first time in nearly 50 years. However, that same year, a dozen adults and two chicks died when a wildfire set by an arsonist ravaged their territory on the Big Sur coast."
14,"With Emissions Soaring, Democratic Governors Sour On Plans To Shut Down Nuclear Power",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Virtually every place that shuts down nuclear plants — from San Diego to New York City, Germany to South Korea — replaces them with fossil fuels, swapping an abundant source of zero-emissions electricity for the very energy sources roasting the planet. But with gas prices and emissions on the rise, two governors are rethinking plans to shut down major nuclear power stations. With just weeks to go before the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station becomes the next U.S. plant to shutter, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) formally asked the Biden administration on April 20 for federal funding to keep the reactors running. On Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told the Los Angeles Times he also wanted federal money to keep Diablo Canyon, his state’s last remaining nuclear plant, open past its 2025 closure date. The announcements mark a shift in the politics of atomic power. At a time when planet-heating gas pollution is surging and efforts in Congress to cobble together a historic clean-energy spending plan have faced repeated setbacks, nuclear energy is becoming more appealing, even among Democrats whose party has historically championed closing down reactors. Nuclear energy is by far the most efficient and reliable electricity source humans have ever harnessed. Nuclear reactors produce power 24/7 on vastly less acreage than wind and solar, regardless of weather conditions. Atomic energy is also safer than fossil fuels, which not only cause global warming but lace the air with deadly, disease-causing particles. But connections to nuclear weapons and rare but catastrophic disasters like the meltdowns in Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 have long stoked opposition to reactors. Natural gas, made cheap by the U.S. drilling boom, gobbled up nuclear companies’ share of the electricity market, while state regulators have made increasingly challenging demands of plant operators, making it even harder to compete. There are some efforts to stave off shutdowns. Last September, Illinois approved nearly $700 million in new subsidies to keep the state’s nuclear fleet afloat in the decade ahead. In November, President Joe Biden signed into law the bipartisan infrastructure deal that established a $6 billion fund to bail out financially troubled reactors. But nuclear power in the U.S. is in trouble. Twelve nuclear reactors in the U.S. have closed permanently since 2012, and another seven are scheduled to shut down by 2025, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Together, they make up more than 7% of the country’s nuclear capacity. Money from the new fund to bail out reactors could make a practical difference in Michigan, where owner Entergy Nuclear has long operated the Palisades plant at a loss. The relatively modest-sized, single-reactor station on the east coast of Lake Michigan had struggled to find buyers for its electricity as more gas plants and wind turbines came online. In January, it won federal regulators’ approval to sell Palisades to Holtec International, a company that decommissions reactors. But an application from California for federal money to save its last remaining nuclear plant would mark more of a symbolic change in the Golden State. The state banned the construction of new nuclear reactors in 1976. But since the two reactors at Diablo Canyon, which were already under construction, came online in 1987, the plant profitably produced nearly one-tenth of California’s electricity from its isolated location near San Luis Obispo. Environmentalists campaigned to close the plant for decades before climate change became the defining issue in drought- and wildfire-prone California. Some feared Diablo Canyon, located near a volatile fault line, could set off a disaster in an earthquake. On the other side of the Pacific, an earthquake played a key role in triggering the accident that irradiated the area around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant 11 years ago. Other critics complained that the plant hurt aquatic animals because its system for cooling reactors with seawater spewed out warmed water that made the coastal area immediately near the plant less habitable for certain species. In 2016, when Newsom was the state’s lieutenant governor, he helped broker a deal between environmentalists, the reactor’s owner, Pacific Gas & Electric and the union representing its workers to shut the plant down. Under the agreement, its first reactor is set to come offline in 2024, with the second following the next year. But in the years that have followed that deal, the effects of climate change have become more visible and have taken a toll on the state’s electricity grid. Wildfires, some sparked by electrical equipment, caused rolling blackouts across the state. Hydroelectric dams that provided close to 13% of California’s power started facing shortages as drought dried reservoirs to new crisis levels. And the limited progress the power sector had made toward slashing emissions under the Obama administration’s climate regulations slowed after President Donald Trump took office and pushed to increase fossil fuel use. In 2020, California regulators delayed the enforcement of new rules banning gas-fired plants from spewing warmed coolant water into waterways — the same problem for which the state went after Diablo Canyon — in a bid to avoid blackouts. Last week, Newsom said California “would be remiss not to” file an application, due May 19, for federal funding to keep the plant open. In an email, Newsom spokesperson Erin Mellon cautioned that the “governor does not have authority over Diablo Canyon’s license,” but added that the “Governor is in support of keeping all options on the table to ensure we have a reliable grid.” Preventing a closure would require PG&E to apply to relicense the plant, then win approval from state and federal regulators. The process would likely take years. PG&E spokesperson Suzanne Hosn said in an email that the company was “always open to considering all options to ensure continued safe, reliable, and clean energy delivery to our customers.” “We always knew this was a political decision, not a financial decision. So I think it’s huge in that this opens the door.” A 2021 study by researchers at MIT and Stanford University found that retrofitting Diablo Canyon to keep it operating until 2035 would reduce power sector emissions in California more than 10% below 2017 levels and save the state $2.6 billion in power system costs. If operated until 2045, those savings increase to $21 billion. “We always knew this was a political decision, not a financial decision. So I think it’s huge in that this opens the door,” said Isabelle Boemeke, a pro-nuclear advocate in California who founded the group Save Clean Energy. “It’s just the beginning in terms of everything that needs to happen. ” But opponents of nuclear power say salvaging the power station would divert resources away from efforts to slash energy use and increase renewable electricity generation. “My worry is that if you create this false prospect that somehow Diablo Canyon stays around, you reduce pressure on everyone involved to accelerate the acquisition of new zero-carbon sources,” said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a key supporter of closing the plant. “Diablo Canyon is a false hope and a false prospect.” The state has many options to import clean power from neighboring states if its own development of new sources lags, Cavanagh said. He added that the labor union representing the workers at the plant supported its closure. But on Friday, the union, now under new leadership, issued a public statement of support for keeping Diablo Canyon open. “Californians are facing big challenges, from COVID to the impacts of extreme drought,” IBEW 1245 business manager Bob Dean wrote in a press release. “A shortage of electric power supply and rolling blackouts must not be added to this list.” The White House’s $6 billion bailout fund limits eligibility to plants that are losing money in the face of competition from gas and other energy sources. That means Diablo Canyon, which is not losing money, would likely not qualify. Paris Ortiz-Wines, a California-based organizer with the pro-nuclear group Stand Up for Nuclear, said Newsom was likely using the federal program as a way to signal his willingness to support the Biden administration’s efforts to keep reactors running. “There’s some game being played,” she said. “Diablo Canyon does not need the federal funding, but I do think it’s in the political conversation right now, so it’s a safe way to make his announcement.” Mark Nelson, a nuclear engineer and consultant who advocates for atomic power, said the move by Whitmer put pressure on Newsom. While Whitmer had not played the active role Newsom did in setting the stage for the next U.S. nuclear closures, the Michigan governor had remained silent throughout the process, according to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a think tank that pushed to keep Palisades open. Both governors are widely discussed as potential Democratic presidential candidates. “What he sees is another ambitious Democratic governor that’s pretty young going along with Biden’s desire, Sen. Joe Manchin’s desire and [Energy Secretary Jennifer] Granholm’s desire to save a nuclear plant,” Nelson said. “He wants to show, ‘I, too, can go along with the program if the program is nuclear.’” A spokesperson for Whitmer did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. But Chris Gadomski, the lead nuclear analyst at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, warned that the eligibility requirements of the federal fund would make it difficult for many utilities to apply. Natural gas prices have more than doubled since the legislation creating the fund was debated, meaning reactors that financially struggled in years past might have more balanced books now that higher costs are making nuclear power more competitive. “The way the rules are written, you have to be losing money to be eligible for support,” he said. “So now you have a problem: How can you close down nuclear plants when gas prices are so high? But when that’s the case, you have to change the rules.” Nelson said he would be “utterly unsurprised if not a penny were disbursed” from the federal fund. But he still sees it as progress toward saving the country’s existing reactors and, eventually, building more. “Nuclear plants are closing because they don’t know that they have long-term revenue, yet this is being addressed by an extremely short-termist program,” Nelson said. “I don’t look at the $6 billion as anything other than a very powerful, attractive sign of nuclear being in favor among Democrats.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,Hawaii Volcano Lava Flow Steady After Starts And Stops,environment," HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano is now erupting a steady stream of lava after a period of intermittent pulsing. The latest eruption began in September but until recently had been stopping and starting every few days, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday. Now the pulsing nature of the eruption has ended and a steady flow of lava is once again filling the volcano’s crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The flow has been nonstop for more than two weeks. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey said that while the volcano is ultimately unpredictable, the current activity shows no signs of slowing and some historic eruptions have lasted decades. “It could go on for quite some time,” said Ken Hon, scientist in charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. “For now it is reestablishing its conduits in the summit area.” A lava lake more than 300 feet deep (91.44 meters) has formed in Halemaumau Crater since the start of the latest eruption. There was another brief eruption in the crater that began in 2020 and lasted for several months. It was the first since a major 2018 eruption caused parts of the summit to collapse and massive amounts of lava to flow into Big Island neighborhoods. Halemaumau Crater has long been home to massive eruptions. The 2018 eruption drained all the lava from the summit lake that had been active there for years. “It’s an exciting time for volcano watchers,” said Ken Rubin, University of Hawaii professor of earth sciences. “It’s interesting to watch the pulse of the volcano,” Rubin said, “because although most of it is predictable or understandable by us after the fact, it doesn’t mean we’re able to fully explain every aspect that’s happening there in real time.” The eruption is within view from some areas of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but officials say weather and time of day can change the visibility. “There are more visitors, and the active volcano is one of the reasons,” said Jody Anastasio, acting public information officer for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. To avoid crowds, Anastasio suggests visiting during late night or early morning hours when the glow of the lava lake can be seen from afar and fewer people are in the park."

0,Decades-Old Human Remains Found In Barrel As Lake Mead Recedes,environment," National Reporter, HuffPost Boaters at Lake Mead on Sunday stumbled across a barrel containing human remains that, based on the decayed nature of the metal drum, appear to have been there for several decades. “My husband heard a woman scream and then he went to look and found the body in a very deteriorated 50-gallon drum,” Shawna Hollister, a Las Vegas resident, told News 3. “He found a man that was mostly bones, except for some of his shirt and belt showing.” The discovery prompted a search of the area by National Park Service rangers, who assisted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in recovering the remains. Photos of the site show a rusted-out barrel that’s partially submerged in mud roughly a foot from the edge of the current lake level. The Clark County coroner’s office told The Associated Press it will oversee efforts to determine the person’s identity. Las Vegas Metro Police Homicide Lt. Ray Spencer told 8 News Now the victim was likely killed in the 1980s, based on items found in the barrel. What’s more, Spencer said, he fully expects to find more bodies as the lake level drops. “I think anybody can understand there are probably more bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead,” he said. “It’s just a matter of, are we able to recover those?” Lake levels at the nation’s largest reservoir have fallen amid a worsening megadrought in the region ― the driest in at least 1,200 years. Last week, receding waters revealed the lake’s original intake valve from 1971: It's official - the top of Intake No. 1 is now visible and the low lake level pumping station is now operational. The new low lake pumping station was completed in 2020 to ensure the delivery of high-quality water in Southern Nevada.

1,Gas Giants Have Been Ghostwriting Letters Of Support From Elected Officials,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost For the past several months, local officials in Virginia and North Carolina, primarily elected Republicans, have been peppering federal regulators with glowing letters in support of gas projects in their states. Internal emails reviewed by HuffPost show that these letters all had something in common: They were ghostwritten by lobbyists and consultants of the two major pipeline firms behind those projects. The communications show how Williams Companies Inc. and TC Energy Corporation worked to boost political support for a number of natural gas infrastructure projects currently under federal review to fill a void left behind by Dominion Energy and Duke Energy’s canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Industry watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute obtained the documents through a series of public records requests that it and others filed. It shared them exclusively with HuffPost. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s premier climate research body, has released its latest sobering reports on global warming. The most recent analysis, published in early April, warns that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than 2025, then be slashed nearly in half by 2030 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change. On Jan. 10, Robert Crockett, the president of Advantus Strategies and a lobbyist for the Oklahoma-based Williams Companies, emailed Wayne Carter, the administrator of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, a draft letter of support for Williams’ Southside Reliability Enhancement Project. The proposed expansion of the company’s existing Transco natural gas pipeline would allow for more natural gas to be transported into North Carolina. The project includes the construction of a new, electric compressor station in Mecklenburg County. “Attached is a draft letter expressing support to the Williams project that we have reviewed with you and your board previously,” Crockett wrote. “Please feel free to modify.” Carter put his signature on the letter and sent it back to Crockett a couple of hours later with only minor tweaks. “Thank you Wayne!” Jay McChesney, a community and project outreach specialist at Williams, responded. “If you wouldn’t mind putting this in the mail and sending to FERC [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] that would be much appreciated…Thank you again for your support of our project.” The letter, which Carter submitted to the regulatory agency later that day on behalf of the county board of supervisors, notes that the project “will be done in a manner that is protective of the environment while providing much-needed benefits to our rural county” and applauds Williams for being “transparent and forthright as an existing corporate citizen in the state.” “We strongly encourage the FERC to approve this proposed project,” the letter reads. At least three Republican state legislators — state Sen. Frank Ruff and state Delegates Tommy Wright Jr. and Les Adams — submitted letters to FERC that contain language identical to or closely mirroring the language in Carter’s letter, indicating the extent to which the company worked behind the scenes. Ruff and Wright also submitted nearly identical letters to FERC in March in support of Williams’ separate Commonwealth Energy Connector Project, another Transco expansion aimed at increasing natural gas supply to southeastern Virginia. The Transco pipeline runs more than 10,000 miles from Texas to New York, transporting approximately 15% of the nation’s natural gas, according to the company’s website. Neither Carter nor 10 elected Republican officials who wrote to FERC to throw their support behind the gas projects responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. Ruff did address HuffPost’s specific questions but said via email that “Williams has been a good corporate citizen that has been involved in the region for over fifty years.” “They serve businesses that hire my constituents,” Ruff said. “If I did not agree with their value to the region, I would not have endorsed their efforts. I believe others would agree with that.” Williams Companies did not respond. Around the same time Williams was pulling political strings in Virginia, Wayne King, a lobbyist and former vice chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, was working to boost support for the project in the Tar Heel State. In January, King’s emails to the offices of two Republicans, North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore and Mooresville Mayor Miles Atkins, emphasized the need for stakeholders to weigh in. “For your convenience, I’ve attached a number of talking points,” King wrote in one exchange. Several of those talking points are included verbatim in the letters Moore and Atkins submitted to FERC, including how Williams is “a responsible corporate citizen, environmental steward, and reliable service provider” and how the project will “stimulate economic development in eastern North Carolina by providing increased access to clean, reliable, and affordable natural gas.” North Carolina Republican state Sen. Bob Steinburg’s letter to federal regulators also features some of the company’s talking points, including a statement about Williams demonstrating its “commitment to environmental stewardship.” Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy, took similar action to garner support for two related projects it is pursuing in Virginia: the Virginia Reliability Project and Virginia Electrification Project. The projects would replace approximately 50 miles of existing pipeline near Petersburg and upgrade compressor stations in the system to boost natural gas capacity in Virginia’s Hampton Roads region. Emails show TC Energy distributed model letters that the Republican mayors of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake submitted in support of the company’s Virginia Reliability Project. “Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with Aaron Thompson and me regarding TC Energy’s Virginia Reliability Project,” Esmel Meeks, a consultant for TC Energy, wrote to Virginia Beach Mayor Robert Dyer in late February. (Thompson is a government and community relations adviser at TC Energy). “We appreciate your willingness to draft a letter of support to FERC and I am writing to follow up. We are in the process of submitting letters and I have attached a draft letter for your review.” The letter that Dyer submitted to FERC three days later is a carbon copy of the draft that Meeks provided and that was released as part of a public records request. Earlier that same month, Meeks provided a similar draft letter to the office of Chesapeake Mayor Rick West. Sandy Madison, one of the city’s deputy clerks, promptly informed Meeks that she’d printed the letter for the mayor to sign. “Please tidy this letter up and print on Mayor letterhead,” Madison later wrote to a colleague. West’s letter applauding the project and the company was submitted to FERC on Feb. 8. “Please know that the people and communities who would be most impacted by VRP are enthusiastic about its benefits,” it reads. “As mayor, I am proud to support it.” Lynn Godfrey, community outreach coordinator for the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, said the communications “tell you the whole story” about industry political influence in the Commonwealth. A native of Hampton Roads, she took particular issue with West’s assertion that the “most impacted” communities are in favor. Many communities are only just learning about the projects, she said. “These pipelines are coming through communities that are already cumulatively impacted by all types of pollutants,” she said. “People don’t want this poison in their neighborhood.” TC Energy did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about its role in the letter-writing. Instead, it said the project will help meet the growing economic needs of the Hampton Roads area. “Local officials, community leaders, businesses, and citizens in the area recognize this project meets their needs and is important for the future of the region, and that is why a broad bipartisan spectrum enthusiastically support the Virginia Reliability Project,” the company said in an emailed statement. In its application for Virginia Reliability Project, TC Energy said the project would help Virginia Natural Gas, a distribution company, meet growing gas demand not only from residents and businesses but more than a dozen military installations and the shipbuilding industry. Virginia Natural Gas is a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas, one of the original partners in the defunct Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The planned pipeline would have stretched 600 miles through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina and was met with fierce opposition from Indigenous and other local communities. In addition to the internal communications, a HuffPost review of the FERC docket found that four Republican state legislators in Virginia — Delegates Emily Brewer and John McGuire III and Sens. Bryce Reeves and Mark Peake — had submitted nearly identical letters in support of TC Energy’s Virginia Electrification Project. The project “will produce environmental benefits as it lowers emissions through the electrification of equipment, all while enhancing capacity,” they wrote. HuffPost is unable to confirm what role, if any, TC Energy played in crafting those letters; however, they are part of a clear trend. Godfrey said that if there is a need for more energy in the Hampton Roads area, it should be satisfied by renewables rather than gas projects that won’t come online for another 2-3 years. “The opposition is mounting,” she said. “All of these things are converging for another big fight.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Watch Belligerent Wild Turkey Come For A D.C. Biker,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A fearless wild turkey has been attacking walkers, joggers and bikers on a trail in Washington, D.C., causing a flap. Several people have reported being chased, slammed into, clawed and pecked in encounters with the big bird on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail in the northeast section of the district. The turkey came for musician DeDe Folarin last month as he rode his bike through the area. “He jumped in the air and he almost clawed my face,” Folarin told local WJLA TV. “He kind of knocked me off the bike and literally chased me around for like five minutes.” When the turkey took off after another biker, Folarin recorded the confrontation on his cell phone — and then chased the bird off with a stick when the woman under attack called to him for help. Ok this is insane …After our story aired last night about a wild turkey attacking people on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail in DC, @DeDefolarin of the incredible @REWickedestBand sent me this video of a turkey attack he shot earlier this month. Never seen anything like this!! pic.twitter.com/L6HcyolK5u Prince George County Parks and Recreation Department has put up a sign to discourage people from approaching the turkey. “Some people don’t listen,” Victor Davila of the parks agency told WJLA. “They try to go up to it and take pictures and stuff like that.” “There is an element of humor to it,” Dan Rauch, a D.C. Department of Energy and Environment wildlife biologist trying to catch the bird, told The Wall Street Journal. “There is a terror turkey stalking a river trail. If I hadn’t seen the videos myself, I would have thought it was an urban myth.” Wild turkeys are making a comeback across the nation. But encounters with humans can be problematic. Males fiercely guard their territories and may also be protecting nests in the spring. They can scratch and bruise people, and puncture skin with their beaks and claws. One victim of the D.C. bird reported in February on a local blog: “A wild turkey that attacked me on the Anacostia trail last night. I ended up at urgent care with puncture wounds on my legs and I had to get a tetanus shot and antibiotics. It was terrifying.” The tom is apparently becoming increasingly aggressive. Park guide Joe Cashman first encountered the bird with another guide last fall while they biked through the area. “We got a kick out of it,” Cashman told the Journal. “Then we started getting complaints. It started getting aggressive. It’s gotten more and more aggressive.” The plan now is to capture the turkey and relocate it. But the bird sometimes high-tails it across the Maryland state line, and takes flight when he sees nets, Cashman pointed out. In the meantime, Folarin said he’s been “prepping myself for the next turkey attack.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Arizona Wildfire Forces Fast Decision: Fight Or Flee Flames?,environment," FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — In a small enclave in northern Arizona where homes are nestled in a Ponderosa pine forest and tourists delight in camping, hiking and cruising on ATVs, high winds are nothing new. But when those winds recently ramped up and sent what was a small wildfire racing toward their homes, residents in the close-knit Girls Ranch neighborhood near Flagstaff faced a dilemma: quickly grab what they could and flee, or stay behind and try to ward off the towering, erratic flames. Most of the property owners left. One couple stood their ground. Another raced to save animals on neighbors’ properties. The blaze that started Easter Sunday swept across vacant lots, scorched tree stumps and cast an orange glow on the parched landscape. Flames licked the corner of one woman’s porch and destroyed two other homes, leaving a mosaic of charred land as the 30-square-mile (77 square-kilometer) fire finally neared full containment this weekend. Elsewhere, firefighters in northern New Mexico on Sunday continued to battle the largest active wildfire in the U.S. as strong winds pushed it closer to the small city of Las Vegas. Officials said the blaze had damaged or destroyed 172 homes and at least 116 structures since it started April 6 and merged with another wildfire a week ago. Officials said the fire had grown to 162 square miles (419 square kilometers), but was still 30% contained. The blazes are among many this spring that forced panicked residents to make life-or-death, fight-or-flee snap decisions as wildfire season heats up in the U.S. West. Years of hotter and drier weather have the exacerbated blazes, leading them to frequently burn larger areas and for longer periods compared with previous decades. Some who live in Girls Ranch had just minutes to react. Polly Velie rushed out of a physical therapy appointment when she learned her home was in the evacuation zone. She sped through embers and thick smoke to find her husband hosing down the driveway. Her voice shrieked as she yelled above the smoke alarms going off throughout the house. “Bill, we gotta go!” she hollered. But Bill Velie — who cut fire lines with a dozer in multiple states for years — was intent on staying. It’s the same decision the couple made in 2010 when another wildfire in the area forced evacuations. Polly Velie said she’s never been more scared, but the choice wasn’t difficult: “This is our house, and he’s my husband.” The couple watched neighbors load up horses and donkeys and haul them off. They saw torched tumbleweeds fly across a major highway, flames tear through an old stone house and a propane tank burst. “Boy, that made her jump,” Bill Velie said. “Just like a bomb went off.” Firefighters encouraged them at least a handful of times to leave, and they agreed to if the winds shifted. More than anything, Bill Velie reassured them he had things under control. He had thinned parts of the national forest on the other side of his property line, and he regularly mows the grass. They kept sprinklers running outside, and Bill Velie bladed the edge of the forest a few times where it looked like the fire was crawling toward neighbors’ homes. At night, the flames twinkled on the hill behind them like red stars in the sky. “I’ve seen some exciting stuff, but not like this for a while,” he said. “Do I miss it? No.” Ali Taranto and her husband, Tim, own a house in the neighborhood. They saw news about the fire on a neighborhood Facebook page and drove from Winslow, where she works as a nurse about an hour away, to check on the 5-acre (2-hectare) property. Ali Taranto drove past the neighborhood’s namesake Girls Ranch property, once a home for troubled girls, and saw parts of the white fence melted to the ground. She checked on her neighbor, Marianne Leftwich, who said she was fine. But Taranto didn’t hear from her for about an hour. Then, Leftwich’s daughter called to say her mother was stuck in her house. Taranto alerted emergency responders, she said, but dispatch told her she’d probably get to Leftwich before they could. Taranto found the woman semi-conscious and gasping for air, in need of  help to evacuate, Taranto said. “As a community in an emergency like this, all the systems were totally overwhelmed,” Taranto said. “Thank God I got there and got her out in time.” Taranto took Leftwich’s dogs to a kennel, then returned to rescue a goat and a cow she saw roaming around nearby. Other than some burned grass and brush, Taranto’s property was unscathed. Harriet Young’s house overlooks the neighborhood. She hired an arborist last year to remove dead trees and cut low-lying branches as a fire-prevention measure. She had pinkish gravel laid on the long driveway and around the front of her house. Young believes it saved the home she and her late husband built in the 1990s. The wildfire burned all around it, sparing the house and the invasive olive trees that her daughter wished hadn’t survived. “This was a miracle, that’s all I got to say,” said Young’s daughter, Stacey Aldstadt, who stayed with her mom for a few days after the fire swept through. When they were allowed back home a week ago on Sunday, they had no heat or hot water. Young spent four days battling with propane companies to get it turned back on. Finally, she persuaded a former fire chief to come by and fix it. Everyone here knows Young, the staunch Democrat who regularly hosts Christmas parties. She made call after call as the fire progressed and planned to stay home, based on what she’d heard. But neighbor Jeanne Welnick saw the plume of smoke that seemed so distant grow and move toward their neighborhood, and urged Young to leave. “I owe Jeanne a huge ‘thank-you,’” Young said. The Welnicks initially bought the house behind Young’s as a vacation property. The previous owners built it with wildfire in mind. The 14-inch-thick (36-centimeter) exterior walls are concrete sandwiched by Styrofoam cells topped by a metal roof. Those walls are still standing. The rest of the Victorian ranch-style home painted orange with green trim isn’t. Flames tore through, twisting strips of metal that creaked as the wind blew through. Shards of glass and nails shot out onto the driveway where the Welnicks wrote their names and the year they bought the house, 2004. A cherub statue the Welnicks placed outside as a memorial to a child they lost to miscarriage looked down at the rubble. Two packages that were delivered to the walkway after the home burned held material for trellis arches the Welnicks planned to assemble over their vegetable garden. Unburned pavers and bags of sand sat off to the side of the garage, ready to be laid down. At midday, a bell that was near the front door to welcome them home rang out, hidden among piles of debris. Jeanne Welnick scanned the property, wondering which trees would survive. She grieved the loss of her paintings and a squash blossom necklace that was passed down through her husband’s family. She kept it in a glass case. “I’d like to look for that, but it’s probably not even there,” said Welnick, an artist. Their dogs, guitars and some sculptures made it out with them, through what Welnick described as a roaring train, dark, scary, like Armageddon. In the aftermath, some neighbors struggled with the right words to say to those who lost their homes. Some offered food, clothes, a place to stay and set up fundraising accounts. “They kept saying, ‘We love you so much; we love you so much,’” Welnick said. “And they do.”"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Millions Of Bees Die On Airport Tarmac After Delta Reroutes Flight,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Millions of honeybees are dead after a flight carrying the pollinator insects from California to Alaska got diverted to Georgia, leading to the bees sitting in crates on the hot airport tarmac. “The worst part about it for me is how they suffered, and there was not a single thing I could do about it,” Sarah McElrea, who had ordered the bee shipment, told The New York Times. McElrea runs a honey company, and also sells bees to backyard beekeepers and commercial pollination services in Alaska. Last week, she was in Anchorage awaiting a shipment of 800 pounds of bees ― about 5 million individual bees ― when Delta Air Lines told her that the bees wouldn’t fit on the plane and were going to be rerouted through Atlanta, according to The Associated Press. The bees were supposed to wait in Atlanta until they could catch a new flight. Initially, Delta was keeping the bees in a cooler indoors, but when they started escaping the next day, the company moved them outside onto the hot tarmac, where the crates baked in the sun. Worried about the fate of the bees, McElrea contacted local Georgia beekeeper Edward Morgan for help. Morgan went to the scene and found that many of the bees had already died, Alaska Public Media reported. In addition to the heat stress in the 83-degree weather, the bees’ containers had also been positioned in such a way that they couldn’t get to the food that was supposed to sustain them for the journey, he told the Times. Delta spokesperson Catherine Morrow called what happened an “unfortunate situation” and told the AP that the company had apologized to McElrea. She added that Delta has “taken immediate action to implement new measures to ensure events of this nature do not occur in the future.” When it became apparent how dire the situation was, beekeepers in the area coordinated to rescue as many of the survivors as possible. More than 20 beekeepers showed up, breaking open crates, providing emergency sugar water to feed the bees, and transporting them to new homes. The exact number of dead bees is unknown, Morgan estimated “at least half” died, he told local news station WABE. McElrea told Alaska Public Media she’s thankful for the beekeepers’ rescue efforts. “I will forever be grateful for anything that they were able to salvage,” she said, adding that they “really are the heroes in this scenario.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
11,"Dogs' Breeds Don't Dictate Their Personalities, Study Finds",environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — Research confirms what dog lovers know — every pup is truly an individual. Many of the popular stereotypes about the behavior of golden retrievers, poodles or schnauzers, for example, aren’t supported by science, according to a new study. “There is a huge amount of behavioral variation in every breed, and at the end of the day, every dog really is an individual,” said study co-author and University of Massachusetts geneticist Elinor Karlsson. She said pet owners love to talk about their dog’s personality, as illustrated by some owners at a New York dog park. Elizabeth Kelly said her English springer spaniel was “friendly, but she’s also kind of the queen bee.” Suly Ortiz described her yellow Lab as “really calm, lazy and shy.” And Rachel Kim’s mixed-breed dog is “a lot of different dogs, personality wise — super independent, really affectionate with me and my husband, but pretty, pretty suspicious of other people, other dogs.” That kind of enthusiasm from pet owners inspired Karlsson’s latest scientific inquiry. She wanted to know to what extent are behavioral patterns inherited — and how much are dog breeds associated with distinctive and predictable behaviors? The answer: While physical traits such as a greyhound’s long legs or a Dalmatian’s spots are clearly inherited, breed is not a strong predictor of any individual dog’s personality. The researchers’ work, published Thursday in the journal Science, marshals a massive dataset to reach these conclusions — the most ever compiled, said Adam Boyko, a geneticist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study. Dogs became humanity’s best friend more than 14,000 years ago, as the only animal domesticated before the advent of agriculture. But the concept of dog breeds is much more recent. Around 160 years ago, people began to selectively breed dogs to have certain consistent physical traits, like coat texture and color and ear shape. The researchers surveyed more than 18,000 dog owners and analyzed the genomes of about 2,150 of their dogs to look for patterns. They found that some behaviors — such as howling, pointing and showing friendliness to human strangers —do have at least some genetic basis. But that inheritance isn’t strictly passed down along breed lines. For example, they found golden retrievers that don’t retrieve, said co-author Kathryn Lord, who studies animal behavior with Karlsson. Some breeds, such as huskies and beagles, may show a greater tendency to howl. But many of these dogs don’t, as both the owner survey and genetic data showed. The researchers could find no genetic basis for aggressive behaviors nor a link to specific breeds. “The correlation between dog behavior and dog breed is much lower than most expected,” said Jeff Kidd, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, who had no role in the research. ___ AP reporter Emma H.

12,Homes 'Completely Blown Away' By Suspected Tornado In Kansas,environment," WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A suspected tornado that barreled through parts of Kansas damaged multiple buildings, injured several people and left more than 6,500 people without power, officials said Saturday. Officials said the suspected twister moved though parts of southeast Wichita and Andover on Friday evening. Andover Fire Chief Chad Russell said during a news conference early Saturday morning that 50 to 100 buildings were damaged in Sedgwick County, though it was not immediately known how many buildings were damaged in Andover. Russell said in some neighborhoods homes “were completely blown away.” Officials said only a few injuries had been reported. In Sedgwick County, three people were injured, including one woman who suffered serious injuries. Russell said no injuries had been reported in Butler County, but a secondary assessment would be conducted Saturday morning. Russell said that while it was not immediately known how many buildings had been damaged, more than 900 structures were in the suspected tornado’s path. He said some neighborhoods were “damaged enough that houses were completely blown down” and cited areas that suffered “very bad damage.” City Hall also sustained damage, which hampered “some of our efforts,” Russell said. Other buildings reportedly damaged included the Dr. Jim Farha Andover YMCA and Prairie Creek Elementary School."
13,Our Country Depends On This Massive Swamp That Has Mostly Been Forgotten,environment," On Assignment for HuffPost In the swampy heart of coastal Louisiana, more than a century of abuse and neglect threaten a national treasure: the Atchafalaya Basin, the nation’s largest cypress swamp. The more than 800,000 acres of forests, lakes and bayous contain hard-to-access wilderness and trees that are over 1,000 years old. Some of the world’s great migratory bird populations stop here on their journey across continents, and its lush swamplands nurture an unparalleled diversity of animal and aquatic life, from threatened species like sturgeon and paddlefish to Louisiana’s world-famous crawfish. The area also has another abundant resource: oil and gas. Drilling rigs and hundreds of miles of pipelines mark the region, pumping out black gold that has long enriched Atchafalaya landowners. The oil industry has constructed a vast network of canals and “spoil banks,” or excavated piles of earth that rise 10 feet or more and act as earthen dams blocking the natural flow of water that drains south into the Gulf, a problem the oil and gas industry, landowners and state agencies have been reluctant to address. Scientists say these spoil banks are turning vast areas of the basin into stagnant pools of swamp water that are strangling the cypress forests and damaging the fisheries. Without this natural flow, huge tracts of the Atchafalaya Basin could be left unrecognizable. Experts say backfilling the canals, or providing more gaps in the spoil banks to let more water flow through, is necessary to make the basin more sustainable. A heated debate is underway between environmentalists and the landowners and oil companies who are resisting efforts to alter the banks — and imperiling the others who rely on the ecosystem. “What’s going on in the basin is criminal,” says Dean Wilson, head of the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper, a member organization that aims to protect the swamp. “The landowners don’t want to get rid of the spoil banks that are causing the problem. They want to get rid of the fishermen.” And there’s another problem that extends beyond the basin: Increasing volumes of sediment and silt from farms and urban runoff are pouring into the Mississippi River upstream and are creating dangerous flooding potential for New Orleans and other communities. That risk worries veteran marine scientist Ivor van Heerden, who has spent much of his career studying flooding and coastal protection issues in Louisiana and has worked with local environmental groups like the Basinkeeper to study restoration projects along the sediment-choked swamps of the Atchafalaya. “It’s a ticking time bomb that no one is addressing,” he said. Sediment has built up the Atchafalaya ever since engineers altered and increased the flow of the Mississippi River and the Red River into the region starting in the mid-1800s. The Army Corps of Engineers has been fighting floods ever since historic Mississippi River flooding across 27,000 square miles of the nation’s midsection and South in 1927, the most destructive flood in U.S. history. Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1928, which authorized the Corps to construct the largest system of levees and flood control measures in the world. In the 1960s, the Army Corps built the Old River Control Structure, a huge series of flood control gates that regulates Mississippi River flows into the Atchafalaya River. Located less than 80 miles north of Baton Rouge, the ORCS is the source of the Atchafalaya, which streams south on its 137-mile journey to the Gulf, roughly 130 miles west of the Mississippi River Delta. Today, depending on flood conditions, a little more than a quarter of the Mississippi River now pours into the Atchafalaya River, making it a critical floodway for southern Louisiana. The Atchafalaya River carries a sediment load of about 88 million tons each year, most all of it from the Mississippi River. The Atchafalaya is the country’s fifth largest river in terms of discharge, and it carries so much sand and sediment that it’s still building land along the Louisiana coast. Atchafalaya environmental, business and political leaders have complained about growing environmental and flooding threats for decades, but only recently have their complaints attracted statewide attention. In December 2020, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards created a task force to address the long-ignored risks, which have been exacerbated by climate change. “The basin’s stressors are not only harming water quality and the environment but also threatening the capacity of the basin to carry floodwaters from the Mississippi and the Red Rivers safely and effectively,” Edwards noted when he announced the formation of the task force. “The basin is the nation’s largest river-basin swamp with a rich ecology, and it is past time that it receives more focused attention here in Louisiana and nationally.” Major floods in 1973 and 2011 nearly overwhelmed the ORCS, which the Army Corps expanded and beefed up with more flood control measures. Hydrologists say the continuing buildup of sediment in the basin threatens its ability to absorb rising Mississippi River floodwaters. That, experts say, could threaten flooding along the Mississippi from the hugely important chemical industry corridor near Baton Rouge all the way to the critically important shipping port of New Orleans. While Army Corps officials say they are studying the growing problem, members of the state’s Atchafalaya task force say they don’t have time for more studies. Last year the group of nearly two dozen local politicians, scientists, landowners, fishermen and environmentalists met a half-dozen times and came up with a list of general recommendations, despite unexpected obstacles in the form of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and another damaging season of storms. Those included Hurricane Ida, which hit Louisiana in late August and nearly made a beeline for the Atchafalaya Basin. The Category 4 storm mercifully veered east at the last moment, but it killed more than 25 people across rural areas of the state and destroyed over a hundred square miles of Barataria marshland before it roared northeast, causing dozens more deaths and billions of dollars of damage across the country. Ida put an exclamation point on the task force’s mission, as scientists say climate change is going to make storms and flooding much worse in coming years. At the end of 2020, the group urged the state to take a more holistic approach to solving the growing environmental problems in the basin, focusing on environmental impacts that usually play second fiddle to navigation and flood control issues. It was the first time a state-sponsored entity called for restoring the north-south flow of swamp water and conserving deep-water habitats essential to the ecological health of the region. This new approach did not sit well with large landowners worried that increased water flow could give commercial fishermen more access to what they considered their private lands. Meanwhile, environmental groups continued to complain that state and federal agencies were still doing little about monitoring the worsening quality of swamp water bottled up by oil and gas canals and spoil banks. “The Atchafalaya is a complicated place,” says Brian Lezina, chief of planning for the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which sponsored the task force meetings. “Big problems require big solutions. We need more federal money to get things done here.” Commercial fisherman Jody Meche says the risk isn’t just flooding — increased sedimentation and poor water quality could devastate his industry. As president of the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association West, Meche says he’s watched a steady decline in the fishery since he started crawfishing as a kid with his dad and grandfather. Though the vast majority of Louisiana crawfish are now farm-raised, Meche has witnessed a steady decline in the health of the wild fishery that has sustained his family for generations. Crawfishing in the basin with his 25-year-old son Bryce last summer, their traps pulled in barely enough to cover gas for the day. Meche is a member of the governor’s task force and says water quality has deteriorated since oil and gas pipeline canals were built, blocking the natural flow of water that nourishes the crawfish in the swampy waters. “People come here from all over the world to eat our crawfish,” Meche said as he pulled up a trap with a dozen of the giant-clawed crustaceans crawling in the bottom. Years ago, he said, he would pull in 600 pounds of crawfish a day. Now he’s lucky to get half that. Scientists say reduced water flow caused by spoil banks and the buildup of sediment can reduce the level of oxygen crawfish depend on to reproduce and thrive. And as the water quality gets worse, Meche is worried he will have to stop fishing altogether. “When crawfish are not doing good, everything else is not going good,” said Meche. “They are like canaries in a mine shaft.” The basin landowners who have profited from its oil and gas operations reject the claim that the industry has wrecked the Atchafalaya. Rudy Sparks, vice president of land for Williams Inc., which holds 85,000 acres of land in the area, blames Army Corps flood control projects and government regulations for upending the natural state of the area. The company has been active in the area since founder Frank Williams moved to Louisiana in the 1870s and bought up swampland that ultimately became some of the largest logging operations in the nation. Eventually, Sparks says, the oil and gas industry supplanted logging revenue for his company until recent decades, when oil exploration largely moved offshore and local oil drilling operations dropped dramatically. Sparks says profits from the oil and timber days are largely done. He agrees there have been negative changes in water quality. But unlike some fishermen and environmental groups that blame the oil industry, Sparks says Army Corps projects — primarily designed to address navigation and flooding concerns — are mostly responsible for destroying water flow in the basin. “It’s a complicated mess. The whole forest and marsh is in severe decline,” Sparks said. “The Army Corps has done more to accelerate the decline of the basin than anyone else.” Army Corps officials admit there are sedimentation problems in the basin, but say they are studying ways to improve the situation. Jim Lewis, director of the Army Corps’ Mississippi River Science and Technology Office, has extensive experience studying the impacts of sediment in the Atchafalaya Basin. Lewis published a 2018 report that showed over the next 50 years, sedimentation in the Atchafalaya River could boost water levels by 3 feet over levels recorded in the 2011 flood event. That flood forced the Army Corps to open part of the emergency Morganza Spillway for just the second time, releasing a deluge of water from the Mississippi River that threatened Atchafalaya communities downstream. Lewis says the Atchafalaya is facing twin dangers from climate change: rising waters in the Gulf of Mexico and higher Mississippi River flows coming from the north. The Corps has not evaluated how miles of oil canals and spoil banks in the basin have impacted water quality, but Lewis says they “want to learn more.” Some scientists say there is good reason to believe that a nightmare could come true. Louisiana State University professor and hydrology expert Yi-Jun Xu has studied sediment flows in the region over the past two decades, and warns that growing levels of sediment are raising river water to dangerous levels and dramatically reducing the basin’s ability to absorb floodwater. Xu says his main concern is a potential disaster at the ORCS, which he believes is the weakest point in the Corps’ elaborate thousand-mile flood control system. If it were ever overtopped and significantly damaged, Xu thinks the Mississippi River could take a shorter course straight down the Atchafalaya River to the Gulf, cutting off the flow of Mississippi River water to petrochemical plants and communities all the way to New Orleans that depend on it for their survival. A 1980 paper from LSU engineering professor Raphael Kazmann and economics professor David Johnson examined the consequences of the failure of that structure and estimated it would cause up to $4 billion in damages in 1977 dollars, likely a huge underestimate since the study did not take into account the costs of rebuilding drinking water infrastructure, as well as the relocation of residents impacted by the potential disaster. The authors said it’s not a question of if, but when. “Just when this will occur cannot be predicted: It could happen next year, during the next decade, sometime in the next 30 or 40 years,” they wrote in 1980. “But the final outcome is simply a matter of time and it is only prudent to prepare for it.” In January, Congress at last stepped up to the plate, authorizing $2.7 billion for Louisiana’s coastal restoration and flood protection projects as part of federal hurricane relief and infrastructure bills. State officials say they plan to direct at least $78 million to basin flooding and water quality projects. But many locals say the state needs to kick in more of its own money too. Currently, Louisiana does not include the Atchafalaya Basin in its $50 billion coastal restoration plan, and it spends only about $6 million a year on projects in the region. Environmentalists and landowners alike say that’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed to protect the natural resources of the area. But the Basinkeeper group argues more money won’t solve the problem if changes aren’t made in how it’s spent. Wilson’s small organization has played an outsize role in alerting the world to destructive environmental activities in Louisiana’s secretive swamplands. He’s taken on powers big and small, including Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s over their purchase of commercial mulch logged from thousands of acres of majestic cypress forests, a practice that Wilson played a role in stopping a decade ago. He says state funding for basin flood control projects has been detrimental to the environment and has benefited special interest groups like landowners and the oil industry. In recent years, Wilson has taken on the region’s largest landowners and fossil fuel companies, as well as state agencies and the Army Corps, which he also blames for much of the environmental decline in the region. The Basinkeeper has worked closely with environmental lawyers to fight construction of massive natural gas pipelines and pry information out of agency files that can shine a light on the degradation of the basin. In 2018, the Basinkeeper filed suit in an unsuccessful effort to stop the controversial Bayou Bridge oil pipeline that now cuts through the Atchafalaya swamp, pumping up to hundreds of thousands of barrels of Texas crude daily to Louisiana refineries. Currently, with the help of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, the Basinkeeper is suing the Army Corps under the Freedom of Information Act to unearth data related to water quality issues. Wilson is especially upset his organization was not included on the Atchafalaya task force, though he supports its recommendations to focus on environmental issues. But in the end, he worries little will be done to improve water quality. His group has complained about flood control projects sponsored by the Army Corps, including a levee in the basin’s Coon Trap area that failed last year and he says allowed a significant amount of silt-laden river water to pour into the swamps. The Basinkeeper is also critical of another major environmental organization active in the region, The Nature Conservancy, the world’s largest conservation NGO with $1.2 billion in total revenue and support in 2020. The nonprofit operates a 5,300-acre preserve in the Atchafalaya and is studying ways to improve water quality and the environment in the region. Earlier this month, the group made public that it had purchased an additional 3,700 acres from Dow Chemical Co. to boost its conservation program in the area. The Conservancy has received support for its basin work from a variety of nonprofit, state and corporate funders, including a $1.6 million grant from Shell Pipeline Co. and financial support from Enterprise Products, a gas pipeline operator in the basin. Conservancy officials say a major focus is improving water flow in the East Grand Lake area, which has suffered from increased sedimentation and water quality problems over the years. The project has been opposed by environmentalists, local residents and fishermen who worry it will result in the introduction of more silt- and sediment-laden water into the swamps that can add more land, which is generally supported by landowners and oil and gas industry interests. The Conservancy’s scientists push back on this criticism, saying they are actively monitoring the area to improve the environment. Bryan Piazza, the Conservancy’s director of freshwater and marine science in Louisiana, says the group is working as an “honest broker” with all Atchafalaya interests to improve water quality in the region despite opposition from fishermen and the Basinkeeper. “If we can get the water flowing again it will benefit everyone,” Piazza said. The controversial East Grand Lake project was paused by the state over the past year, but officials say they are now working with the Army Corps to get a permit approved. The Conservancy’s state director, Karen Gautreaux, who sits on the governor’s task force and formerly worked for the state, agrees water quality is a growing problem in the basin. She argues that working with other interests, including the oil and gas industry, is key to finding solutions to complex environmental issues. “Being a conservationist and a landowner are not mutually exclusive,” she said. But Wilson and fishermen like Meche who have lived and worked in the Atchafalaya for decades, argue that projects like East Grand Lake are working against the best interests of the swamp. Van Heerden, the scientist who has worked with the Basinkeeper, says his analysis shows the proposed project on Conservancy land will end up “making things worse.” And in Wilson’s view, the oil industry and landowners are getting what they want. “They are just filling in the swamp,” said Wilson. While virtually everyone agrees that water quality is a problem in the Atchafalaya, major landowners like Williams Inc.’s Sparks are “uncomfortable” with state task force recommendations they say would create deeper water flow in some areas and promote public fishing access to their private lands, something fishing groups deny. But Sparks says if nothing is done to fight increasing sedimentation in the basin, river bottoms and water levels will keep rising, including in the grandest river of all, the Mississippi. Many experts agree the Mississippi River is overdue to change course, as it has naturally done over eons of time. Scientists say no matter what we do to try to contain the Mississippi, it will always fight to change its path as sediment builds up. The great nonfiction writer John McPhee, who wrote extensively about the region, described the Mississippi River’s changing history as “a pianist playing with one hand — frequently and radically changing course, surging over the left or the right bank to go off in new directions.” What concerns Xu and others even more is that climate change and growing sedimentation of the riverbeds is creating a perfect storm that will be hard to stop. Xu worries that a major hurricane the size of Hurricane Katrina or Harvey will hit the Mississippi area northwest of New Orleans. That, he says, could dislodge a 500 million-ton slug of built-up river sediment, creating floodwaters that could overwhelm the ORCS. That would allow the river to seek a path down the Atchafalaya, destroying towns, levees and swamplands in its raging rampage to the Gulf. “We are underestimating the seriousness of the situation,” Xu says. “Many people in the Corps are engineers who think an engineering approach can keep this from happening … but we can’t fight that massive amount of sediment moving in such a short period of time.” Army Corps experts disagree with these dire predictions. While they acknowledge that climate change is driving increased rainfall and more powerful storms in the area, they say there have been major improvements made in the ORCS and the levee system since it was significantly damaged in a major 1973 flood. The Corps continues to closely monitor and model flooding emergencies in the region, and officials are confident they can handle whatever threats Mother Nature throws at them. John Day, an LSU emeritus professor of marine sciences, says it’s likely the Mississippi will change course, though he’s not sure where. Both Day and other scientists say it’s time to transition our thinking from restoring nature to adapting to it, which will require protecting certain communities over others. “We need to protect the infrastructure of our fisheries,” said Day. That’s something many people in the Atchafalaya Basin would support. Henderson Mayor Sherbin Collette grew up in a family of fishermen. He’s been mayor of Henderson for 17 years and has helped make the small town prosperous as the “Gateway to the Atchafalaya,” which features a dinosaur park and casino that attracts visitors off busy I-10. More theme parks are being planned, and the town’s bank account is $3 million in the green, the mayor says. But he worries that may not last for long as the threat of flooding increases. “I remember when the Atchafalaya Basin was a gem,” he said. “Now it’s full of stagnant water and stinks to high heaven. … They ruined the basin because of oil.” But it’s the increasing storms and hurricanes that worry him the most. Collette says Henderson has been lucky over the past few years, but that luck won’t always hold. “Two-thirds of the U.S. drains down here,” he said. “If you think it’s bad now, just wait.” One of the ironies of the Atchafalaya Basin is that some people who live near the delta on the Gulf may be more secure from flooding than others who live farther away from the coast. That’s because the sediment-laden Atchafalaya River is building land in the delta, which is growing about a square mile per year on average. LSU’s Robert Twilley, a veteran coastal researcher and the longtime director of the Louisiana Sea Grant program until last year, has spent much of his career researching the coastal zone of the Atchafalaya Basin. He says the delta is of special interest to researchers around the world because it’s building land in the face of rising seas, which Twilley expects to continue for decades barring a catastrophic flooding event. Eventually, though, rising seas will overcome the sedimentation effects of the river. At that point, he said, “all bets are off.” But if the Mississippi River ever does change course down the Atchafalaya, even sea level rise would be no match for Old Man River, Twilley said. “It would make one hell of a delta.” Funding for this story was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists Rapid Response Grants, which included support from the Hewlett Foundation, the Bullitt Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation.

14,'Wolf Sighting' Turns Out To Be Roving Pack Of Saint Bernards: Officials,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A woman in Colorado reported seeing wolves, but authorities say there was a decidedly more slobbery explanation. Colorado Parks and Wildlife received a “report and accompanying video of a possible wolf sighting” on Monday, according to a news release from the Park County Sheriff’s Office, which assisted in investigating the case of the mysterious canines. The video in question shows large canines traversing a snow-covered landscape from some distance away. “Based on information the Sheriff has received, it is believed that the sighting was actually a group of large-breed St. Bernard dogs that live in the area and have a documented history of escaping their enclosure in the area,” the release said. The dogs’ owner also “confirmed the five dogs were running loose” at the same time the sighting occurred. Gloria Adams, the woman who shot the video, maintains she wasn’t just crying wolf. “They were chasing the elk when I first spotted them, there were seven WOLVES,” she told HuffPost in an email, adding that the animals she saw had “pointed ears” and were about four miles from where she knows the notorious Saint Bernards live. But officials don’t believe the animals caught on camera were indeed wolves. “There are no known wolves in this area,” parks and wildlife spokesperson Travis Duncan told HuffPost in an email. “This area is approximately 100 miles south of the area where we know of an existing pack.” The sheriff’s office said the distance, along with the “lighting and shadows,” could have made it erroneously appear that the animals were wolves. It would hardly have been the only time that domestic pets have been mistaken for wildlife. Fluffy dogs have previously inspired reports of lions on the loose in Virginia and Spain. And a woman in California with a Maine coon cat named Spock told HuffPost in 2016 that multiple people had knocked on her door because they were concerned that she was harboring a bobcat.

15,Joey To The World! Bronx Zoo Announces Birth Of Rare Tree Kangaroo,environment," NEW YORK (AP) — A baby tree kangaroo that’s just poking its nose out of its mother’s pouch is the first of its species born at the Bronx Zoo since 2008, zoo officials announced Friday. The birth of the Matschie’s tree kangaroo joey “is an exciting birth for the Bronx Zoo and a unique opportunity for people to observe one of nature’s most intriguing evolutionary adaptations,” zoo director Jim Breheny said in a news release. The Matschie’s tree kangaroo is native to Papua New Guinea and is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is arboreal and lives in mountain rainforests. The species is much smaller than Australia’s well-known red kangaroo. An adult male Matschie’s tree kangaroo weighs between 20 and 25 lb (9–11 kg). The joey is about the size of a human thumbnail at birth, zoo officials said. The tiny joey crawls through the mother’s fur to enter her pouch and emerges after about seven months. “At this stage of development, the joey will spend a lot of time in his mom’s pouch with just its head sticking out,” Breheny said. “As it matures it will begin to explore its environment and start spending short periods of time outside the pouch.” Conservationists believe that fewer than 2,500 Matschie’s tree kangaroos remain in the wild. They are threatened by habitat destruction, hunting and other human activities."

0,Record-Shattering India Heat Wave Scorches Wheat Crop As Reserves Are Strained,environment," NEW DELHI (AP) — An unusually early, record-shattering heat wave in India has reduced wheat yields, raising questions about how the country will balance its domestic needs with ambitions to increase exports and make up for shortfalls due to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Gigantic landfills in India’s capital New Delhi have caught fire in recent weeks. Schools in eastern Indian state Odisha have been shut for a week and in neighboring West Bengal, schools are stocking up on oral rehydration salts for kids. On Tuesday, Rajgarh, a city of over 1.5 million people in central India, was the country’s hottest, with daytime temperatures peaking at 46.5 degrees Celsius (114.08 Fahrenheit). Temperatures breached the 45 C (113 F) mark in nine other cities. But it was the heat in March — the hottest in India since records first started being kept in 1901 — that stunted crops. Wheat is very sensitive to heat, especially during the final stage when its kernels mature and ripen. Indian farmers time their planting so that this stage coincides with India’s usually cooler spring. Climate change has made India’s heat wave hotter, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. She said that before human activities increased global temperatures, heat waves like this year’s would have struck India once in about half a century. “But now it is a much more common event — we can expect such high temperatures about once in every four years,” she said. India’s vulnerability to extreme heat increased 15% from 1990 to 2019, according to a 2021 report by the medical journal The Lancet. It is among the top five countries where vulnerable people, like the old and the poor, have the highest exposure to heat. It and Brazil have the the highest heat-related mortality in the world, the report said. Farm workers like Baldev Singh are among the most vulnerable. Singh, a farmer in Sangrur in northern India’s Punjab state, watched his crop shrivel before his eyes as an usually cool spring quickly shifted to unrelenting heat. He lost about a fifth of his yield. Others lost more. “I am afraid the worst is yet to come,” Singh said. Punjab is India’s “grain bowl” and the government has encouraged cultivation of wheat and rice here since the 1960s. It is typically the biggest contributor to India’s national reserves and the government had hoped to buy about a third of this year’s stock from the region. But government assessments predict lower yields this year, and Devinder Sharma, an agriculture policy expert in northern Chandigarh city said he expected to get 25% less. The story is the same in other major wheat-producing states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Overall, India purchased over 43 million metric tons (47.3 million U.S. tons) of wheat in 2021. Sharma estimates it will instead get 20% to nearly 50% less. Even though it is the world’s second-largest producer of wheat, India exports only a small fraction of its harvest. It had been looking to capitalize on the global disruption to wheat supplies from Russia’s war in Ukraine and find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa, and Asia. That looks uncertain given the tricky balance the government must maintain between demand and supply. It needs about 25 million tons (27.5 million U.S. tons) of wheat for the vast food welfare program that usually feeds more than 80 million people. Before the pandemic, India had vast stocks that far exceeded its domestic needs — a buffer against the risk of famine. Those reserves have been strained, Sharma said, by distribution of free grain during the pandemic to about 800 million people — vulnerable groups like migrant workers. The program was extended until September but it’s unclear if it will continue beyond then. “We are no longer with that kind of a surplus . . . with exports now picking up, there would be a lot of pressure on the domestic availability of wheat,” Sharma said. India’s federal agriculture and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions sent to them via email. Beyond India, other countries are also grappling with poor harvests that hinder their ability to help offset the potential shortfall of supplies from Russia and Ukraine, normally the world’s largest and fifth-largest exporters of wheat. China’s agriculture minister, Tang Renjian, said last month that the winter wheat harvest was likely to be poor, hindered by flooding and by delays in planting. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

1,California To Investigate Fossil Fuel Companies Over Deceptive Plastic Recycling Myths,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost California’s attorney general opened a sweeping investigation into the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry on Thursday over its alleged role in the spread of rampant plastic pollution, issuing a subpoena to ExxonMobil and vowing to hold polluters responsible for any crimes. Attorney General Rob Bonta said that the investigation will focus on what he called a “half-century campaign of deception” and that it will target companies “that have caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis.” Plastic pollution has long been a tentpole environmental issue, with conservationists decrying the spread of plastics to the remotest corners of the Arctic, into the planet’s geology and in the bodies of everything from the stomachs of sea birds to human lungs. “Enough is enough,” Bonta said in a statement Thursday. “For more than half a century, the plastics industry has engaged in an aggressive campaign to deceive the public, perpetuating a myth that recycling can solve the plastics crisis. The truth is: The vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled.” #BREAKING: We’re launching an investigation into the plastics industry for its role in causing the global #plasticpollution crisis and deceiving the public. Plastic pollution is seeping into our water, poisoning our environment and blighting our landscapes. Enough is enough. For more than 50 yrs, the plastics industry has engaged in an aggressive campaign to deceive the public that recycling can solve the plastics crisis.  The truth is: the vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled.We're going to find out more about this campaign of deception. pic.twitter.com/n2bD6uOFQb The Los Angeles Times noted that Bonta’s investigation comes as lawmakers across California work to reduce plastic waste and ban some types of single-use plastic. A proposed measure on the California ballot in November could give voters the chance to mandate all single-use plastic packaging be recyclable, refillable or compostable by 2030. Exxon is the first company to receive a subpoena, but Reuters reported that other companies are likely to get a call from Bonta’s office. The attorney general said in a news conference he believed Exxon was a “major source of global plastics pollution” and that it had used deceptive practices for decades, The Hill reported. Despite a widespread belief that many plastics are recyclable, less than 9% of plastics were recycled in the U.S. in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The remaining 91% ends up in landfills, is incinerated or winds up in the environment. A 2020 report by NPR and PBS’ “Frontline” found the plastics industry knew recycling the products would be prohibitively “costly” and “infeasible” as early as the 1970s. But the industry spent millions of dollars a year touting the benefits of plastic and encouraging consumers to recycle anyway. Bonta said his office would target the industry’s effort to minimize public understanding about the “harmful consequences of these products,” homing in on the “historic and ongoing efforts to deceive the public.” “The plastics industry, comprised of major fossil fuel and petrochemical companies, began an aggressive ― and deceptive ― marketing and advertising campaign to convince the public that they could recycle their way out of the plastic waste problem,” he said Thursday. “Executives at major fossil fuel companies, however, knew the truth.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

However, the vessels are potentially vulnerable to underwater sabotage or attack, and dolphins could serve as a means to counter any Ukrainian divers. Militaries have been training dolphins and other animals for decades. The Soviet navy began training dolphins during the Cold War. The U.S. Navy has trained marine mammals for recovery operations and tasks like finding underwater mines since the 1960s. (It’s a common misconception that dolphins have been trained to kill). The U.S. program, which is based out of San Diego, has been declassified since the 1990s. In 2019, fishermen in Norway spotted a beluga whale wearing what appeared to be a harness that could hold GoPro-type cameras. Scientists later said they believed the whale, dubbed Hvaldimir, was trained by the Russian military. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Yellowstone Tourist Sneaks Up On Bison. Bison Does What A Bison Does.,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A clueless tourist got away with his hide but not his dignity when he snuck up on a bison at Yellowstone National Park. Footage of the encounter was posted Friday to the “Welcome To YNP: Invasion of the Idiots!” Facebook page and shows the man creeping up to the massive animal from behind. The bison turned and chased the camera-toting man away. The outcome could have been so much worse. Watch the clip here. “It is illegal, as well as dangerous, to approach wildlife,” Yellowstone spokesperson Linda Veress told For the Win. “Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans. The animals in Yellowstone are wild and unpredictable, no matter how calm they appear to be.” Sean Swetter, who posted the video, wrote that the man’s wife “asked for my bear spray to get the bison away from the trail so they could get back to their car.” In 2020 a 72-year-old woman was gored when she tried to take pictures of a bison from just 10 feet away. In 2019 a 9-year-old girl was thrown in the air by a charging bison. These animals are so strong they can toss each other, too. Next time, man with the camera, keep a safe distance.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Climate Change May Increase Risk Of New Infectious Diseases,environment," Climate change will result in thousands of new viruses spread among animal species by 2070 — and that’s likely to increase the risk of emerging infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans, according to a new study. This is especially true for Africa and Asia, continents that have been hotspots for deadly disease spread from humans to animals or vice versa over the last several decades, including the flu, HIV, Ebola and coronavirus. Researchers, who published their findings Thursday in the journal Nature, used a model to examine how over 3,000 mammal species might migrate and share viruses over the next 50 years if the world warms by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which recent research shows is possible. They found that cross-species virus spread will happen over 4,000 times among mammals alone. Birds and marine animals weren’t included in the study. Researchers said not all viruses will spread to humans or become pandemics the scale of the coronavirus but the number of cross-species viruses increases the risk of spread to humans. The study highlights two global crises — climate change and infectious disease spread — as the world grapples with what to do about both. Previous research has looked at how deforestation and extinction and wildlife trade lead to animal-human disease spread, but there’s less research about how climate change could influence this type of disease transmission, the researchers said at a media briefing Wednesday. “We don’t talk about climate a lot in the context of zoonoses” — diseases that can spread from animals to people, said study co-author Colin Carlson, an assistant professor of biology at Georgetown University. “Our study ... brings together the two most pressing global crises we have.” Experts on climate change and infectious disease agreed that a warming planet will likely lead to increased risk for the emergence of new viruses. Daniel R. Brooks, a biologist at University of Nebraska State Museum and co-author of the book “The Stockholm Paradigm: Climate Change and Emerging Disease,” said the study acknowledges the threat posed by climate change in terms of increasing risk of infectious diseases. “This particular contribution is an extremely conservative estimate for potential” emerging infectious disease spread caused by climate change, said Brooks. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and interim director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the study confirms long-held suspicions about the impact of warming on infectious disease emergence. “Of particular note is that the study indicates that these encounters may already be happening with greater frequency and in places near where many people live,” Bernstein said. Study co-author Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University, said that because climate-driven infectious disease emergence is likely already happening, the world should be doing more to learn about and prepare for it. “It is not preventable, even in the best case climate change scenarios,” Albery said. Carlson, who was also an author on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said we must cut greenhouse gas and phase out fossil fuels to reduce the risk of infectious disease spread. Jaron Browne, organizing director of the climate justice group Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, said the study highlights climate injustices experienced by people living in African and Asian nations. “African and Asian nations face the greatest threat of increased virus exposure, once again illustrating how those on the frontlines of the crisis have very often done the least to create climate change,” Browne said."
11,1 In 5 Reptile Species In The World Threatened With Extinction,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — Even the king cobra is “vulnerable.” More than 1 in 5 species of reptiles worldwide are threatened with extinction, according to a comprehensive new assessment of thousands of species published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Of 10,196 reptile species analyzed, 21% percent were classified as endangered, critically endangered or vulnerable to extinction — including the iconic hooded snakes of South and Southeast Asia. “This work is a very significant achievement — it adds to our knowledge of where threatened species are, and where we must work to protect them,” said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study. Similar prior assessments had been conducted for mammals, birds and amphibians, informing government decisions about how to draw boundaries of national parks and allocate environmental funds. Work on the reptile study – which involved nearly 1,000 scientists and 52 co-authors – started in 2005. The project was slowed by challenges in fundraising, said co-author Bruce Young, a zoologist at the nonprofit science organization NatureServe. “There’s a lot more focus on furrier, feathery species of vertebrates for conservation,” Young said, lamenting the perceived charisma gap. But reptiles are also fascinating and essential to ecosystems, he said. The Galapagos marine iguana, the world’s only lizard adapted to marine life, is classified as “vulnerable” to extinction, said co-author Blair Hedges, a biologist at Temple University. It took 5 million years for the lizard to adapt to foraging in the sea, he said, lamenting “how much evolutionary history can be lost if this single species” goes extinct. Six of the world’s species of sea turtles are threatened. The seventh is likely also in trouble, but scientists lack data to make a classification. Worldwide, the greatest threat to reptile life is habitat destruction. Hunting, invasive species and climate change also pose threats, said co-author Neil Cox, a manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s biodiversity assessment unit. Reptiles that live in forest areas, such as the king cobra, are more likely to be threatened with extinction than desert-dwellers, in part because forests face greater human disruptions, the study found."
12,'Unprecedented' Move Sees Millions Ordered To Cut Water Use In Drought-Stricken California,environment," LOS ANGELES (AP) — Southern California’s gigantic water supplier took the unprecedented step Tuesday of requiring about 6 million people to cut their outdoor watering to one day a week as drought continues to plague the state. The board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California declared a water shortage emergency and required the cities and water agencies it supplies to implement the cutback on June 1 and enforce it or face hefty fines. “We don’t have enough water supplies right now to meet normal demand. The water is not there,” Metropolitan Water District spokesperson Rebecca Kimitch said. “This is unprecedented territory. We’ve never done anything like this before.” The Metropolitan Water District uses water from the Colorado River and the State Water Project to supply 26 public water agencies that provide water to 19 million people, or 40% of the state’s population. But record dry conditions have strained the system, lowering reservoir levels, and the State Water Project — which gets its water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta — has estimated it will only be able to deliver about 5% of its usual allocation this year. January, February and March of this year were the driest three months in recorded state history in terms of rainfall and snowfall, Kimitch said. The Metropolitan Water District said that the 2020 and 2021 water years had the least rainfall on record for two consecutive years. In addition, Lake Oroville, the State Water Project’s main reservoir, reached its lowest point last year since being filled in the 1970s. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked people to voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 15%, but so far residents have been slow to meet that goal. Several water districts have instituted water conservation measures. On Tuesday, the board of the East Bay Municipal Utility District voted to reduce water usage by 10% and cap daily usage for some 1.4 million customers in Contra Costa and Alameda counties, including Oakland and Berkeley. Households will be allowed to use 1,646 gallons (6,231 liters) per day — far above the average household usage of about 200 gallons (757 liters) daily — and the agency expected that only 1% to 2% of customers will exceed the limit, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The Metropolitan Water District restrictions apply to areas of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties that rely mostly on state water supplied through the district, including some parts of Los Angeles city. Mainly urban areas are impacted. The MWD’s client water agencies must implement either the one-day-a-week outdoor use restriction or find other ways of making equivalent reductions in water demand, Kimitch said. Although the water agencies support the water conservation move, it remains to be seen whether the public will do it, Kimitch said. The Metropolitan Water District will monitor water use and if the restrictions don’t work, it could order an all-out ban on outdoor watering as soon as September, she said. Meanwhile, state lawmakers have taken the first step toward lowering the standard for how much water people use in their homes. California’s current standard for residential indoor water use is 55 gallons (208 liters) per person per day. The rule doesn’t apply to customers, meaning regulators don’t write tickets to people for using more water than they are allowed. Instead, the state requires water agencies to meet that standard across all of its customers. But the state Senate overwhelmingly voted last week to lower the standard to 47 gallons (178 liters) per person per day starting in 2025 and 42 gallons (159 liters) per person per day beginning in 2030. The bill has not yet passed the Assembly, meaning it is still likely months away from becoming law. The U.S. West is in the middle of a severe drought just a few years after record rain and snowfall filled reservoirs to capacity. Scientists say this boom-and-bust cycle is driven by climate change that will be marked by longer, more severe droughts. A study from earlier this year found the U.S. West was in the middle of a megadrought that is now the driest in at least 1,200 years."
13,Climate Activist's Self-Immolation Prompts Conversations On Protest And Faith,environment," Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old climate activist and Buddhist,  set himself on fire in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, prompting a national conversation about his motivation and whether he may have been inspired by Buddhist monks who self-immolated in the past to protest government atrocities. Bruce, a photographer from Boulder, Colorado, walked up to the plaza of the Supreme Court around 6:30 p.m. Friday – on Earth Day — then sat down and set himself ablaze, a law enforcement official said. Supreme Court police officers responded immediately but were unable to extinguish the blaze in time to save him. Investigators, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said they did not immediately locate a manifesto or note at the scene and that officials were still working to determine a motive. On Saturday, Kritee Kanko, a Zen Buddhist priest who described herself as Bruce’s friend, shared an emotional post on her public Twitter account saying his self-immolation was “not suicide” but “a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis.” She added that Bruce had been planning the act for at least a year. She wrote: “#wynnbruce I am so moved.” She got sympathetic responses as well as backlash. Kanko and other members of the Rocky Mountain Ecodharma Retreat Center in Boulder, released a statement Monday  saying “none of the Buddhist teachers in the Boulder area knew about (Bruce’s) plans to self-immolate on this Earth Day,” and that had they known about his plan, they would have stopped him. Bruce was a frequent visitor to the Buddhist retreat center in the mountains near Boulder where he meditated with the community, Kanko said. “We have never talked about self-immolation, and we do not think self-immolation is a climate action,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, given the dire state of the planet and worsening climate crisis, we understand why someone might do that.” On Facebook, Bruce wrote about following the spiritual tradition of Shambhala, which combines Tibetan Buddhism with the principles of living “an uplifted life, fully engaged with the world,” according to the Boulder Shambhala Center. Bruce also posted praise for Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a leader of engaged Buddhism, around the time of his death in January. Bruce’s act of sitting down and setting himself on fire was reminiscent of the events of June 11, 1963, when Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk, seated cross-legged, burned himself to death at a busy Saigon intersection. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dinh Diem, a staunch Catholic. In a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr,. whom Hanh counted as a friend, Hanh wrote that he drew inspiration from the Vietnamese monk’s self-sacrifice, saying: “To burn oneself by fire is to prove what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.” In Tibet, anti-Chinese activists have employed self-immolation as a form of protest. The International Campaign for Tibet says 131 men and 28 women – monks, nuns and laypeople among them – have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Beijing’s strict controls over the region and their religion. Buddhism as a religion does not unilaterally condone the act of self-immolation or taking one’s life, said Robert Barnett, a London-based researcher of modern Tibetan history and politics. “Killing yourself is considered damaging in Buddhism because life is precious,” he said. “But if a person self-immolates because of a higher motivation and it’s not out of a negative emotion such as depression or sadness, then the Buddhist position becomes far more complex.” If self-immolation is done to help the world, it might be accepted as a positive action, Barnett said. He cited a story from the “Jataka Tales,” a body of South Asian literature concerning the prior incarnations of the Buddha in human and animal form. In that particular tale, an incarnation of the Buddha, in an act of selfless compassion, offers himself to an emaciated tigress who was so hungry that she was ready to devour her own cubs. “But that kind of self-sacrifice is not encouraged, developed or talked about for normal people (other than the Buddha),” he said, adding that this is because of “the immense difficulty of cultivating positive motivation in any situation, let alone maintaining it under stress or in conditions of extreme pain.” Buddhism emphasizes emotional balance, inclusiveness, kindness, compassion and wisdom, said Roshi Joan Halifax, an environmental activist and abbot of the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “What we’re seeing today among many people is hopelessness,” she said. “What we are called to do is not to be disabled by that sense of futility, but to transform our moral suffering into wise hope and courageous action.” Despite the pessimism that some climate activists may feel, there is reason to remain hopeful, Halifax said. “You see that people are waking up to the magnitude of the climate catastrophe,” she said, noting that countries and corporations are moving away from damaging practices and toward clean energy. “I feel inspired and hopeful by our ability to change and adapt in this ever-changing world,” she said. “My heart is heavy that (Bruce) did not have that kind of optimism.” Those who knew Bruce saw a man who was kind, playful and idealistic – an avid dancer who participated in weekly events. He was also known for biking and embracing public transportation. Bruce, who enjoyed the outdoors, brought an intensity to whatever he did, said his friend Jeffry Buechler. On Buechler’s wedding day in 2014, Bruce, on a whim, decided to go for a dip in a cold mountain lake early in the morning, he said. Bruce also suffered lasting effects from a brain injury he sustained in a car wreck that killed his best friend about 30 years ago, Buechler said. Marco DeGaetano, who met Bruce in the 1990s when they both attended a Universalist church in Denver, said “Wynn seemed to have an affinity for people who needed help.” He recalled Bruce being kind to a church member with a mental illness when others distanced themselves. DeGaetano said he last saw Bruce about a month ago, and he seemed outgoing and friendly as always — every time he saw Bruce, “he had a smile on his face.” ___ Bharath reported from Los Angeles and Slevin from Denver.

14,U.N. Warns: Get Ready For A Lot More Catastrophes In Next 10 Years,environment," A disaster-weary globe will be hit harder in the coming years by even more catastrophes colliding in an interconnected world, a United Nations report issued Monday says. If current trends continue the world will go from around 400 disasters per year in 2015 to an onslaught of about 560 catastrophes a year by 2030, the scientific report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said. By comparison from 1970 to 2000, the world suffered just 90 to 100 medium to large scale disasters a year, the report said. The number of extreme heat waves in 2030 will be three times what it was in 2001 and there will be 30% more droughts, the report predicted. It’s not just natural disasters amplified by climate change, it’s COVID-19, economic meltdowns and food shortages. Climate change has a huge footprint in the number of disasters, report authors said. People have not grasped how much disasters already cost today, said Mami Mizutori, chief of the UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, “If we don’t get ahead of the curve it will reach a point where we cannot manage the consequences of disaster,” she said. “We’re just in this vicious cycle.” That means society needs to rethink how it finances, handles and talks about the risk of disasters and what it values the most, the report said. About 90% of the spending on disasters currently is emergency relief with only 6% on reconstruction and 4% on prevention, Mizutori said in an interview Monday. Not every hurricane or earthquake has to turn into a disaster, Mizutori said. A lot of damage is avoided with planning and prevention. In 1990, disasters cost the world about $70 billion a year. Now they cost more than $170 billion a year, and that’s after adjusting for inflation, according to report authors. Nor does that include indirect costs we seldom think about that add up, Mizutori said. For years disaster deaths were steadily decreasing because of better warnings and prevention, Mizutori said. But in the last five years, disaster deaths are “way more” than the previous five years, said report co-author Roger Pulwarty, a U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and social scientist. That’s because both COVID-19 and climate change disasters have come to places that didn’t used to get them, like tropical cyclones hitting Mozambique, Mizutori said. It’s also the way disasters interact with each other, compounding damage, like wildfires plus heatwaves or a war in Ukraine plus food and fuel shortages, Pulwarty said. Pulwarty said if society changes the way it thinks about risk and prepares for disasters, then the recent increase in yearly disaster deaths could be temporary, otherwise it’s probably “the new abnormal.” Disasters are hitting poorer countries harder than richer ones, with recovery costs taking a bigger chunk out of the economy in nations that can’t afford it, co-author Markus Enenkel of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative said. “These are the events that can wipe out hard-earned development gains, leading already vulnerable communities or entire regions into a downward spiral,” he said. The sheer onslaught of disasters just add up, like little illnesses attacking and weakening the body’s immune system, Pulwarty said. The report calls for an overhaul in how we speak about risk. For example, instead of asking about the chances of a disaster happening this year, say 5%, officials should think about the chances over a 25-year period, which makes it quite likely. Talking about 100-year floods or chances of something happening a couple times in 100 years makes it seem distant, Mizutori said. “In a world of distrust and misinformation, this is a key to moving forward,” said University of South Carolina Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute Co-Director Susan Cutter, who wasn’t part of the report. “We can move forward to reduce the underlying drivers of risk: Inequality, poverty and most significantly climate change.” ___ Follow AP’s climate coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

15,"Wildfires Tear Across Several States, Driven By High Winds",environment," OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Firefighters across the country are battling multiple wildfires as tinder-dry conditions and high winds whip up flames from Arizona to Florida — including a prairie fire in rural southwestern Nebraska that has killed one person, injured at least 15 firefighters and destroyed at least six homes. A break in the weather in parts of the Midwest and West allowed crews to make progress Monday on some of the nearly dozen new large fires that were reported in recent days across the nation — four in New Mexico, three in Colorado and one each in Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas. With more than 1,350 square miles (3,496 square kilometers) burned so far this year, officials at the National Interagency Fire Center said the amount of land singed to date is outpacing the 10-year average by about 30%. Hotter, drier weather has combined with a persistent drought to worsen fire danger across many parts of the West, where decades of fire suppression have resulted in overgrown and unhealthy forests and increasing development have put more communities at risk. In northern New Mexico, evacuations remained in place for several communities Monday and conditions were still too volatile for authorities to assess the damage caused Friday and Saturday. The blaze has has grown into the largest wildfire burning in the U.S., charring more than 88 square miles (228 square kilometers). Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation joined Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on a call Monday with officials from the White House and federal agencies to appeal for more federal ground resources ahead of another blast of strong fire-fueling winds expected later in the week. Thanks to lighter winds in the Midwest on Monday, firefighters made significant progress on the fire that’s burned about 70 square miles (181 square km) of mostly grasslands and farmland near the Nebraska-Kansas state line. It’s now estimated to be about 47% contained. They made the most of the opportunity Monday to dump water in dry creeks and draws filled with cottonwoods where dense fuels and brush has built up ahead of the return of more dangerous conditions expected on Tuesday, said Jonathan Ashford, spokesman for the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team. “It’s supposed to be about 20 degrees warmer tomorrow, lower humidity and increased wind,” he said Monday night. In Arizona, firefighters also took advantage of lighter winds to boost containment of a more than 33-square-mile (85 square-kilometer) blaze that has been burning outside of Flagstaff for more than a week. Strong winds that had fueled the fire are expected to return later this week. Meanwhile, hundreds of evacuated residents were given the go-ahead on Sunday to return home. About 160 firefighters, emergency management personnel and others — twice as many as the day before — were helping fight the fire in Nebraska by Monday evening. Known as the Road 702 Fire, it has destroyed at least six homes and threatened 660 others, along with 50 commercial or farm buildings, Ashford said. A retired Cambridge, Nebraska, fire chief who was helping as a fire spotter in Red Willow County died Friday night after his truck went off the road in a blinding haze of smoke and dust. The body of John Trumble, 66, of Arapahoe, was recovered around early Saturday. Trumble was the second person in a month to die while fighting a wildfire in southwest Nebraska. Elwood Volunteer Fire Chief Darren Krull, 54, was killed in a collision with a water tanker on April 7 in Furnas County as smoke cut visibility to zero. Nebraska remains critically dry, said Ashford, who urged residents to use caution when doing anything that could spark a fire. “The last thing we need is to have another fire started that we have to then fight,” he said. ____ Susan Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

0,Emergency Declaration For Multiple Wildfires In New Mexico,environment," SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed emergency declarations as 20 wildfires continued to burn Sunday in nearly half of the state’s drought-stricken 33 counties. One wildfire in northern New Mexico that started April 6 merged with a newer fire Saturday to form the largest blaze in the state, leading to widespread evacuations in Mora and San Miguel counties. That fire was at 84 square miles (217 square kilometers) Sunday and 12% contained. An uncontained wind-driven wildfire in northern New Mexico that began April 17 had charred 81 square miles (209 square kilometers) of ponderosa pine, oak brush and grass by Sunday morning north of Ocate, an unincorporated community in Mora County. Meanwhile in Arizona, some residents forced to evacuate due to a wildfire near Flagstaff were allowed to return home Sunday morning. In Nebraska, authorities said wind-driven wildfires sweeping through parts of the state killed a retired Cambridge fire chief and injured at least 11 firefighters. Winds and temperatures in New Mexico diminished Saturday but remained strong enough to still fan fires. Dozens of evacuation orders remained in place. Fire officials were expecting the northern wildfires to slow Sunday as cloud and smoke cover moves in, allowing the forests to retain more moisture. But they added that the interior portions of the fires could show moderate to extreme behavior, which could threaten structures in those areas. More than 200 structures have been charred by the wildfires thus far and an additional 900 remain threatened, Lujan Grisham said. Fire management officials said an exact damage count was unclear because it’s still too dangerous for crews to go in and look at all the homes that have been lost. “We do not know the magnitude of the structure loss. We don’t even know the areas where most homes made it through the fire, where homes haven’t been damaged or anything like that,” said operation sections chief Jayson Coil. Some 1,000 firefighters were battling the wildfires across New Mexico, which already has secured about $3 million in grants to help with the fires. Lujan Grisham said she has asked the White House for more federal resources and she’s calling for a ban of fireworks statewide. “We need more federal bodies for firefighting, fire mitigation, public safety support on the ground in New Mexico,” she said. “It’s going to be a tough summer. So that’s why we are banning fires. And that is why on Monday I will be asking every local government to be thinking about ways to ban the sales of fireworks.” Wildfire has become a year-round threat in the West given changing conditions that include earlier snowmelt and rain coming later in the fall, scientist have said. The problems have been exacerbated by decades of fire suppression and poor management along with a more than 20-year megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. In Arizona, two large wildfires continued to burn Sunday 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott and 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff. Coconino County authorities lifted the evacuation order Sunday morning for residents living in neighborhoods along Highway 89 after fire management officials determined the Flagstaff-area wildfire no longer posed a threat. The fire near Flagstaff was at 33 square miles (85 square kilometers) as of Sunday with 3% containment. It forced the evacuation of 766 homes and burned down 30 homes and two dozen other structures since it began a week ago, according to county authorities. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey declared the fire a state of emergency Thursday for Coconino County to free up recovery aid to affected communities. The wildfire near Prescott began last Monday and was at 4.8 square miles (12.4 square kilometers) and 15% contained as of Sunday morning as helicopters and air tankers dropped water and retardant to slow the fire’s growth. The cause of the wildfires in New Mexico and Arizona remain under investigation. Nebraska Emergency Management Agency officials said John P. Trumble, of Arapahoe, was overcome by smoke and fire after his vehicle left the road Friday night because of poor visibility from smoke and dust. Trumble, 66, was working with firefighters as a spotter in Red Willow County in the southwestern corner of the state and his body was found early Saturday, authorities said. Wildfires were still burning Saturday night in five Nebraska counties. The Nebraska National Guard deployed three helicopters and several support trucks to help battle the blazes."
1,Family Finds Out 'Odd' Snoring Noises Are 5 Bears Hibernating Under House,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost In a bit of a reverse Goldilocks scenario, a California family discovered that five bears had found their home just right. The South Lake Tahoe residents had been hearing “some odd rumbling, snoring-like noises” throughout the winter, but had been ignoring the mysterious sounds because they “simply didn’t make sense,” the BEAR League, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people coexist with bears, wrote on Facebook earlier this week. The neighbors even suggested they might be imagining things. But the sounds were very real, and there was a logical explanation: bears hibernating in the crawl space underneath the house. When the bears ― a mother and four young bears around a year old ― woke up, the human residents of the home “could no longer deny there was probably a bear under the house,” the group wrote. But even then, they didn’t suspect there were so many. “The residents didn’t realize there were five bears under their house until we got there and told the bears to come out... and then we counted five,” BEAR League Executive Director Ann Bryant told HuffPost in an email. “They had just thought it was one very noisy bear.” The BEAR League then “un-invited Mama Bear,” a process Bryant said involved “being territorial and scary, thereby making the bear believe it’s not going to be safe there anymore.” She emphasized that volunteers never physically hurt bears, though “sometimes we do hurt their feelings.” Once the mother was roused out of the crawl space, she called back to the cubs and they followed her out. The BEAR League noted on Facebook that three of the cubs were the mother’s biological offspring, but one was an orphaned cub she had “adopted” last year. Bears adopting cubs is “considered to be quite rare,” Bryant said, but it does happen. In this case, the cub’s biological mother had been hit by a car. After the ursine family vacated the crawl space, an “electrical barrier” was installed in the crawl space opening so any bears trying to get in will get a small shock. But Bryant added that prevention is the best defense against unwanted bear lodgers. “Each winter, about 100 to 150 of our bears attempt to hibernate under homes here at Tahoe,” she said. “The BEAR League is kept very busy moving bears out of these crawl spaces, often several bears each day.” Crawl spaces have “cave-like” openings that seem like a “vacancy sign” to bears looking to hibernate. But people can easily solve this problem by closing up those openings. “People really need to make sure their crawl space openings are closed and secured before bears go inside... especially in the fall, when they are looking for hibernation dens,” she said.

2,10 Missing After Underground Tremor At Coal Mine In Poland,environment," WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A powerful underground tremor and methane gas discharge hit a second coal mine Saturday in southern Poland, forcing dozens of workers to flee the mine and leaving authorities unable to contact 10 other miners still missing, officials said. The accident at 3:40 a.m. Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine occurred 900 meters (2,950 feet) underground. It was the second colliery accident in just four days in the coal mining region around the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, near the Czech border. Repeated methane blasts since Wednesday at the nearby Pniowek mine have killed five miners, left seven miners and rescue workers missing and injured dozens of others. The search for those missing at Pniowek was suspended Friday after new blasts late Thursday injured seven rescue workers, some seriously. Both mines are operated by the Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa, or JSW, company. The company said 52 workers were in the area of the tremor Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine and 42 of them were able to leave the shaft on their own without injuries. A rescue operation was launched for the 10 missing miners. By late Saturday afternoon, rescue workers were 600 meters (yards) from the site of the tremor and advancing slowly toward where the missing were expected to be, the JSW company said. But it added that high levels of methane in the area could pose a danger and required caution from the rescue team. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Twitter that this was “devastating news again” from the mining region and said his prayers are with the missing and their relatives. Poland relies on its own coal and coal imports for almost 70% of its energy needs, drawing criticism from the European Union and environmental groups who are concerned about CO2 emissions and meeting climate change goals. Most Polish coal mines are in the southern Silesia region. The Polish government has been scaling down the use of coal and recently announced it would end coal imports from Russia by May, part of Poland’s drive to reduce its dependence on Russian energy in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine."
3,Maryland Becomes 2nd U.S. State To Ban Declawing Cats,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed a bill into law this week making Maryland the second U.S. state to ban the declawing of cats. “Our beloved kitties, who cannot advocate for themselves, need us to protect them,” Democratic state Sen. Cheryl Kagan said in a statement from The Paw Project, a nonprofit dedicated to ending the declawing of cats. The new law, which goes into effect in October, prohibits veterinarians from performing the surgical procedure, unless it’s “necessary for a therapeutic purpose.” Those who violate it could face fines of up to $1,000. Declawing a cat is a major surgery that involves amputating the last bone of each toe, similar to amputating each first knuckle on a person’s hand. On top of the initial recovery pain and risk of infection, it can lead to lifelong pain as it alters the way that the cat walks. Some opponents of declawing bans have raised concerns they could lead to more cats being given up by people who don’t want the cats to scratch furniture, or who have concerns about the cats scratching people. However, research suggests that that declawing can lead to  worse behavioral issues. For instance, cats without claws can be more likely to bite if they feel threatened. Declawing can also lead to litter box problems, like urinating around the house, because cat litter can irritate declawed paws. The first U.S. state to ban declawing was New York, which did so in 2019. It’s also illegal in numerous other countries ― including much of Europe ― some Canadian provinces, and at the municipal level in some U.S. cities, including Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco, among others.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Finland Is On The Brink Of A Nuclear Power ‘Game Changer’,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost OLKILUOTO ISLAND, Finland ― From the outside, it looks like any other modern Nordic building rising several stories from a cleared swath of pine forest on this quiet, rural island off this country’s verdant southwest coast. But inside, hard-hatted workers are busy completing a feat of engineering that has never existed. It involves a robotic system and a basement network of switchbacking tunnels carved more than 1,300 feet into the Earth’s crust. Once finished, the project, called Onkalo, will turn the page to a new chapter of nuclear energy’s turbulent 80-year story and make history for the power plant just a two-minute drive down the road. In a matter of months, the machines inside this boxy gray building will begin a weekly routine that will continue for a century: placing highly radioactive gray cuboid rods into copper cylinders the length of a Lincoln Town Car. From there, the canisters will travel roughly two hours underground to crypts meant to keep the spent-fuel rods undisturbed for millennia in bedrock that geologists say hasn’t shifted in almost 2 billion years. Sealed twice over in bentonite clay ― which expands when wet, preventing water from seeping in and corroding the capsules, and offers stability in case of an earthquake ― this site is meant to entomb nuclear waste for as close to eternity as any human endeavor can guarantee. The project will store waste from the decades-old nuclear power complex next door. Last month, Finland switched on Olkiluoto-3, the third and biggest generator at the power station here. The reactor, one of the largest ever built and the first to open in Western Europe in at least 15 years, will produce about 14% of Finland’s electricity. Combined with the plant’s other two reactors, this speck of an island will provide 36% of the country’s power. On its own, the new reactor would be notable as a rare bullish bet on atomic power at a time when, despite the world’s attempts to slash climate-changing emissions and wean Europe off the fossil fuels financing Russia’s war machine, more countries have closed nuclear plants than have opened new ones. But Onkalo makes this the world’s first nuclear power plant that solves the problem of the toxic waste that has for years rendered humanity’s most reliable and efficient energy source politically radioactive across much of the globe. “This is a message from Finland that we have a solution to make nuclear power sustainable,” said Janne Mokka, the chief executive of Posiva Oy, the company building the storage site. “This gives certainty on what is the question of final disposal. It has never been done.” Yet it has been tried. The United States proposed building a permanent storage site in the Nevada desert at Yucca Mountain but canceled the project a decade later under pressure from Nevada politicians and Native Americans. France is digging its own facility, where it will store waste in clay. Sweden is working on an underground repository that mirrors Finland’s approach. Canada is also considering possible sites for its own. Nuclear energy has remained controversial across the rich world, even though it’s one of the safest forms of electricity generation, especially compared with fossil fuels that not only cause climate change but also lace the air with deadly disease-causing particles. Reactors are by far the most reliable source of electricity in existence, producing tremendous volumes of power 24/7 from relatively tiny nuggets of mined uranium, unlike solar panels and wind turbines that require vast operations and huge amounts of metal, and can prove less reliable in cloudy, windless weather. But nuclear power has very high upfront costs and the building process is slow. It’s also politically unpopular, in no small part because of the threat posed by radioactive waste. The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency hailed Onkalo as a “game changer” for the nuclear industry when its officials toured the construction site in November 2020. Replicating the storage facility could prove tricky, particularly in the U.S., and some in the industry wonder if permanent burial is in fact the best answer to waste that still contains vast quantities of usable energy. But Finland is hoping to show the world how to preserve our climate and modern industrial society for future generations without saddling them with waste that remains dangerous for as many years as have passed since mammoths and early humans roamed the Ice Age tundra. More than a quarter-million tons of nuclear waste sits stored at power plants across the world. The U.S. alone has produced more than 85,000 metric tons of spent fuel since the 1950s. That may sound like a lot, but nuclear waste is heavy, and even that total is compact enough to fit on a single football field. Hardly the green glowing goo seen in cartoons, spent fuel comes out in hollow bundles of zirconium-alloy rods filled with gummy bear-sized pellets of enriched uranium. The country’s 93 remaining reactors, which generate just less than one-fifth of U.S. electricity, produce waste at a rate of about 2,000 tons per year. Spent fuel is stored across the country at about 80 sites, mostly at the same facilities as the reactors that produced the waste, either in container pools where rods are kept cool or in dry casks. A typical large reactor produces about 25 metric tons of high-level radioactive spent fuel per year. Finland has five large reactors. Nuclear reactors produce energy by splitting atoms of uranium in a process known as fission, where a neutron collides with an atom, splits it and releases huge volumes of energy in the form of heat and radiation. In a power plant, that heat is harnessed to turn water into steam, which spins turbines that generate electricity. Radiation is all around us all the time. It’s just energy moving through space, and it takes many forms, including ultraviolet light and radio transmission signals. Its effect on human health is measured by a metric called sieverts. One millisievert ― one-thousandth of a sievert ― is harmless. A banana contains 0.01 millisieverts. Uranium miners and nuclear plant workers receive an average annual dose of about 2 millisieverts, according to the World Nuclear Association data. A flight crew routinely taking the polar route from New York City to Tokyo takes in about 9 millisieverts per year. A single pelvic CT scan generally equates to a 10 millisievert dose. After exposure to 100 millisieverts, your chances of getting cancer may go up slightly. A single dose of 1,000 millisieverts is enough to induce nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. At least half the people in a group exposed to 5,000 millisieverts at once will die within a month. A short-term dose of 10,000 millisieverts is a death sentence within weeks. The average person receives 2.4 millisieverts per year from ambient radiation just from walking around, receiving low doses of radon and thoron in homes and buildings and from cosmic radiation. The average U.S. home exposes you to 228 times more radiation than living near a nuclear power plant, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. A decade after it’s removed from a reactor, nuclear waste can produce a dose of radiation of about 100,000 millisieverts per hour. But radiation decreases in half-lives over time. After about 1,000 years, waste decays back to the radioactive levels of its original mined ore, but keeping it isolated from the environment around it remains important to avoid irradiating plants and animals in the food chain. Onkalo is being built to last 100,000 years. Such timescales give any reasonable person pause. But nuclear power occupies a uniquely fear-inducing place in popular culture, goaded by images that range from the recklessly buffoonish nuclear plant operator Homer Simpson on “The Simpsons” — as well as his misanthropic boss, Mr. Burns — and scenes of skin-blistering agony in HBO’s “Chernobyl.” Ash from a coal-burning power plant, which contains radioactive materials and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury that, unlike uranium, remain steadily toxic forever, spews 100 times more radiation into the surrounding area than a nuclear plant producing the same amount of energy. Radioactive minerals dredged up during gas drilling now contaminate communities across the U.S. The fine particles that burning fossil fuels spew into the air, meanwhile, caused 1 in 5 premature deaths worldwide in 2018 alone, according to a landmark Harvard University study, and increased the rates of diseases ranging from erectile dysfunction to dementia. Just 49% of U.S. adults said they favor nuclear power in a 2019 Gallup poll, down from a high of 62% in 2010. Overwhelming majorities of self-identified Democrats, women and those without college degrees opposed nuclear power. More Republicans than Democrats supported expanding nuclear power in a Pew Research Center survey from January. A plurality of U.S. adults, 35%, favored encouraging production of nuclear power, while 26% wanted the energy source discouraged and 37% said it should be neither encouraged nor discouraged. That made nuclear power slightly more popular than oil and gas drilling but far less supported than renewable energy production. That could also be a symptom of what the polling firm Bisconti Research, which frequently looks at public attitudes on atomic energy and has routinely found more favorable opinions than other surveys, calls a “perception gap” in which a majority of Americans judge public opinion of nuclear power to be less favorable than their own. In Finland, by contrast, about half the population of nearly 5.6 million supports expanding nuclear power while a quarter say the current level is appropriate, according to a 2021 poll from Finnish Energy ― a survey that, while conducted by an industry trade group, is widely trusted because it’s been ongoing for decades with the same questions. Just 18% of respondents supported reducing the current levels of nuclear power, down from more than 40% in previous decades. “Traditionally, Finns have been pretty pro-nuclear, and it’s a pro-technology, pro-engineering country,” said Tea Törmänen, a biologist and the executive director of the Finnish climate group RePlanet. “My guess is because the environmental conditions in Finland have always been so harsh, so we’ve had to rely on inventions, innovations and technology to survive.” She’s a member of the Green Party, which historically, in most Western countries, serves as a bastion of anti-nuclear advocacy. But even the Finnish chapter of Greenpeace, another vehemently anti-nuclear group in most nations, largely supports nuclear power. Building a permanent waste site has long enjoyed strong support among nuclear skeptics, Törmänen said. “When the final repository was decided on, the Greens, even though at the time they were opposing nuclear in general, they weren’t opposing the solution to the waste,” Törmänen said. “They thought, ‘We have these nuclear plants; we must deal with the waste responsibly.’ So there’s this allowance to be practical.” When Onkalo was first proposed, each municipality under consideration in Finland was consulted and given veto power. The small farming and fishing community that traditionally existed on Olkiluoto Island ultimately accepted the project, which it saw as a boon for tax revenue and jobs. Part of the benefit is that the island already hosted a nuclear power plant with dozens of employees, so most people in the area knew someone who worked there. In Rauma, the charming medieval town just a 20-minute drive south from Olkiluoto Island, residents walking the cobblestone streets late one afternoon seemed largely unconcerned about the new nuclear reactor and storage site less than 10 miles away. “It’s quite a safe place, and the regulations are there for a reason,” said Mikko Ammer, 39, a security worker at the nuclear plant. “If it’s done properly, it’s safe. And Onkalo is a huge part of that.” Nuclear power is “difficult” because of the waste it creates, said Aino Yrjölä, 17. “But maybe this solves the problem for the next generation,” she said of Onkalo. Leena Kiviranta, who said she was in her 30s, had more immediate concerns as she picked up a flattened cardboard milk carton from the ground. “I’m not worried about it at all,” she said of the nuclear projects. “I’d rather keep my energy on the sun and the spring, and I hope people would just be more natural and stop putting garbage on the street.” Those attitudes stand in stark contrast to the U.S. attempt to build a permanent storage site at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain. Federal officials selected the site in the desert roughly 150 miles northwest of Las Vegas against the protests of the Western Shoshone Nation, who complained that the facility, located on land used for decades as a nuclear testing site, was on their treaty territory. Farmers in the Amargosa Valley also raised concerns that the waste could leach into the water table and contaminate crops. The project was stalled for decades, but in 2002 the George W. Bush administration granted final approvals and underground testing began. Then in 2008, when the waste site finally applied for licensing from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the facility came up against the Obama administration, which had been skeptical. The final blow came in 2010, when Sen. Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was then the Senate majority leader, convinced the White House to abandon the project. Dealing with nuclear waste “takes political will, and that’s not something we have in abundance in our country right now,” said Gerald Frankel, a material scientist at Ohio State University who has long worked on the issue of waste disposal. In Nordic countries, including Finland and Sweden, he said, “what they have done is to embed people in the community and address concerns. The approach is to have consent-based siting and have community brought into the process. That’s not the way we have approached it in this country.” The sheer size of the U.S. raises the additional problem that waste would need to be transported across vast distances, raising the risk of an accident or terrorist attack along the way. But putting aside the lack of political will for even a single site, Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the sole location the U.S. could consider for first permanent storage in 1988, creating a legal logjam that prevents federal authorities from pursuing other options without changing the law. After the Obama administration halted Yucca Mountain, a federal commission convened to assess the country’s nuclear future recommended that the Department of Energy pursue a “consent-based” effort to find a new location for a repository. But so far it hasn’t done much. And in 2017, the Government Accountability Office issued a report finding that resuming the Yucca Mountain project would be difficult. “We’re basically in limbo,” Frankel said. Even as climate change and geopolitics broaden the appeal of nuclear plants, the energy source still struggles with high costs and long delays. This is in part the result of the industry’s hollowing-out over the past few decades, meaning the workforce and skilled knowledge on how to build highly technical and tightly regulated structures have shrunk, especially compared with Russia and China, where large plants continue to be built regularly. The lone nuclear reactor under construction in the U.S., Southern Co.’s Plant Vogtle in Georgia, hit even more delays in February, sending total costs surging past $30 billion and postponing electricity production until at least 2023. In the United Kingdom, the company building the only major reactor under construction, Hinkley Point C, also announced delays and cost increases. If new nuclear plants have a future in the U.S. and the Western world, it’s most likely as small, modular reactors. The technology already exists ― small reactors power military boats and submarines ― but a handful of startups in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are working on licensing commercial versions of the machines to serve as power plants. The projects are at various stages of completion and licensing. But as they come closer to commercial viability, a point analysts predict they will reach around 2030, they face a problem: Where to get fuel. Since the 1990s, Russia has been the primary source of enriched uranium for reactor fuel in the U.S., the result of a deal the Clinton administration made to boost the former U.S. rival’s economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unlike France, which produces the vast majority of its electricity from nuclear power and recycles a sizable portion of its waste, the U.S. does not reuse its spent fuel. (Finland and Sweden opted out of recycling in the 1970s because it was seen as too expensive and they had no use for the plutonium, a byproduct that can come from reenrichment, which is usually produced for nuclear weapons.) “Dealing with nuclear waste takes political will, and that’s not something we have in abundance in our country right now.” But small-reactor startups that want to sell their machines to, for example, the U.S. military to use on remote bases need to use what is called “unobligated uranium” ― essentially fuel that comes from domestic sources. Plans to build a new enrichment facility in Idaho fell through as cheap Russian uranium made the project too costly. Yet now, companies such as California-based Oklo Inc. are eyeing new ways to recycle spent fuel, which still retains up to 95% of its energy content even after it’s used. If that bet pays off, it makes investments in permanent storage sites underground less appealing, said Chris Gadomski, the lead nuclear analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF. “There’s a lot of discussion about recycling that fuel and burning it in advanced reactors … so my thinking on it is burying the fuel with all this energy content doesn’t make any sense at all, you might as well try to find a reactor that can burn it,” he said. “Why deposit an asset that has this much energy still available?” But reprocessing uranium produces plutonium, the even more deadly compound used in nuclear weapons. Increasing recycling, therefore, raises risks not only of contamination but also of more proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “We have a slogan here: from rock to rock,” said Pasi Tuohimaa, Posiva’s head of communications. “Geologists would say we have bedrock that’s so old, that hasn’t moved in all of human history. What could be a safer place on Earth?” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Twitter Bans Ads That Contradict Science On Climate Change,environment," BERLIN (AP) — Twitter says it will no longer allow advertisers on its site who deny the scientific consensus on climate change, echoing a policy already in place at Google. “Ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis,” the company said in a statement outlining its new policy Friday. There was no indication that the change would affect what users post on the social media site, which along with Facebook has been targeted by groups seeking to promote misleading claims about climate change. The announcement coinciding with Earth Day came hours before the European Union agreed a deal requiring big tech companies to vet their sites more closely for hate speech, disinformation and other harmful content. Twitter said it would provide more information in the coming months on how it plans to provide “reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations” its users engage in, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The U.N.-backed science panel’s reports on the causes and effects of climate change provide the basis for international negotiations to curb climate change. The company already has a dedicated climate topic on its site and offered what it described as “pre-bunks” during last year’s U.N. climate conference to counter misinformation surrounding the issue."
12,How Nebraska’s Governor Became A General In A Right-Wing Disinformation War,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Margaret Byfield wasn’t going to wait for actual information. She’d quickly concluded that the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30,” was a “massive federal land grab” in the making. What she needed now were soldiers for her opposition campaign. The more powerful, the better. Byfield, the executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, a fringe, right-wing organization that has ties to the fossil fuel industry and has become a magnet for anti-federal land zealots, would find her star in Nebraska Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. Before long, American Stewards built a cozy relationship with Ricketts’ office — one that catapulted the Republican governor to the very top of a growing and successful anti-30x30 disinformation campaign. Internal communications HuffPost obtained via a public record request to Ricketts’ office show Byfield acting as a shadow adviser of the governor, not only on 30x30 but other environmental policy issues. She even played a direct role in crafting an executive order the governor signed in late June aimed at preventing President Joe Biden from implementing his 30x30 plan in Nebraska. One of the governor’s top aides, Taylor Gage, was in regular contact with Byfield between February and November of last year. The two kept one another abreast of their anti-30x30 efforts and shared materials ahead of a series of town halls the governor held around the state to “raise awareness about the threat 30x30 poses to our way of life here in Nebraska.” They also strategized about dealing with reporters and which media outlets could best help them get their message out. Byfield’s emails include language resembling what a top-ranking staffer might say: things like “we need to respond” and “I don’t think we need to comment on this.” At one point she acted as a liaison between Ricketts’ office and fellow 30x30 foe Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), requesting and apparently securing a statement from Ricketts in support of Boebert’s legislation aimed at blocking the Biden 30x30 pledge. On Friday, which is Earth Day, American Stewards will sponsor a “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska — what Byfield has described as “the most important conference” her group has ever organized. It will be a who’s who of land transfer proponents, climate change deniers, conservation foes and sympathizers of anti-government extremists. A release about the summit that went out last month boasted that it will “spoil environmentalist’s [sic] Earth Day” and “send the clear message that America’s landowners would not be ‘voluntarily’ surrendering their property rights to the environmental agenda.” Ricketts is hosting the event and will share the stage with Byfield, Boebert, Trump-era Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, anti-federal land Utah state Rep. Ken Ivory (R) and other leading figures of the anti-30x30 movement. The event’s sponsors include three of the nation’s fiercest proponents of climate change denialism — the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, The Heritage Foundation, and The Heartland Institute — and Protect the Harvest, a pro-agriculture, anti-animal rights group founded by oil tycoon Forrest Lucas. Lucas and Protect the Harvest played an outsized role in securing President Donald Trump’s pardons for Dwight Lincoln Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, the father-son Oregon ranchers whose arson conviction sparked the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Byfield, Ricketts’ office and Gage, who is now executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party, did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. And American Stewards was selective about which media can attend the “most important conference” in its history: The organization denied HuffPost credentials to cover it. Biden’s 30x30 target is in line with a proposed United Nations framework for protecting biodiversity amid the deepening extinction and climate crises, and has growing support within the global scientific community. A week after taking office, Biden followed through on a campaign promise and set 30x30 as a national goal. His executive order established a process for engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, from states and Native American tribes to farmers and anglers, to get input about how best to achieve the 30% target. (Approximately 12% of all U.S. lands are now permanently protected, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.) There is absolutely nothing to suggest the plan, which the administration has since branded “America the Beautiful,” will involve confiscating property or deceptive tactics to gain control of private land. In an initial report outlining its vision for protecting and restoring 30% of lands and waters by the end of the decade, the Biden administration committed to “collaboration, support for voluntary and locally led conservation and honoring of Tribal sovereignty and private property rights.” The overall lack of detail in Biden’s initial directive, however, allowed paranoia and conspiratorial thinking to permeate conservative circles. Almost immediately, American Stewards labeled 30x30 a “land grab” and warned its audience that the Biden initiative “hands the powers of the Federal regulatory agencies to a movement that has been working to abolish private property for decades.” Within weeks, Ricketts would be a top soldier in the anti-30x30 movement. According to the documents obtained by HuffPost, American Stewards began to communicate with Ricketts’ staffer within weeks of Biden’s order. On Feb. 17, 2021, Byfield received an email from Tanya Storer, a rancher and commissioner in rural Cherry County, Nebraska, who’d recently asked her to help fight a proposed conservation easement at a private ranch in the area. Storer informed Byfield that she’d recently discussed the 30x30 initiative with her “friend” and “colleague” Gage, then the governor’s director of strategic communications, and wanted to introduce the two of them so they could coordinate a time for Byfield to sit down with Ricketts. “I am anxious for the two of you to visit,” Storer wrote. In a response the following day, Byfield expressed her interest in briefing Ricketts on Biden’s “very concerning” effort. She declared that the president’s team had been “populated by the extreme faction of the environmental movement.” And she shared materials with Gage that her small nonprofit had put together on 30x30, including “fact sheets” and model resolutions that local governments could pass to oppose the program. “We believe States and local governments need to speak out against this,” Byfield wrote to Gage. “Land ownership and management should not be dictated from Washington, D.C., but should be determined at the local level.” Byfield met with Ricketts at the state capitol in Lincoln on March 10, emails show. And soon after, Ricketts was publicly echoing Byfield’s “land grab” rhetoric and other anti-30x30 talking points. “When the agriculture secretary [Tom Vilsack] says it’s not a land grab, then you know it is a land grab,” Ricketts told a crowd at one of his anti-30x30 town hall meetings back in June. Projected on a screen behind him was an image of a remote road beneath storm clouds and the words “30x30 LAND GRAB.” It was taken straight from American Stewards’ website. American Stewards of Liberty was formed in 2009, but it has its roots in the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement that started in the 1970s and sought to remove lands from federal control. One of its precursors is Stewards of the Range, which was established in 1992 to defend Byfield’s father, Nevada rancher and sagebrush rebel Wayne Hage, who battled with the Forest Service for years over unpermitted grazing on public lands — a prequel of sorts to the armed standoff at Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s ranch that gave rise to an extremist militia movement. American Stewards is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The majority of its revenue comes from donations, major gifts, and income from trainings, speaking fees and consulting contracts with local governments. Between 2015 and 2019, Kane County, Utah, paid the organization $483,000 for land-use consulting and legal services, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Over that same five-year period, Donors Capital Fund and Donors Trust, two groups that received millions from the fossil fuel moguls Charles and David Koch and have funneled huge amounts of dark money to climate change denial and other conservative causes, gave American Stewards at least $170,000, according to the Center for Media and Democracy. Byfield and her husband are the organization’s only full-time employees. In 2019, the most recent year for which tax information is available, their combined salaries accounted for $192,381 of a total of $308,647 in spending. On its website, the organization says it is “dedicated to protecting private property rights, defending the use of our land, and restoring local control.” In the past, fulfilling that mission has largely consisted of consulting at the county level on land management issues, working to get imperiled species removed from the federal endangered species list and contesting environmental rules. But when Biden dropped his 30x30 plan in early 2021, the group latched on and didn’t let go. It has fought the conservation target with a blend of misinformation, conspiracy theories and fear-mongering, as the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities exhaustively detailed in a report earlier this week. Some have questioned if the group’s anti-30x30 campaign flouts federal rules for tax-exempt nonprofits. At a recent appearance before the San Juan County Commission in New Mexico, Byfield declared that private land is a “major target” of 30x30 and that “the ultimate goal is to eliminate use of the land.” Other rhetoric has been completely outlandish. At one of her anti-30x30 training sessions in South Dakota, Byfield promptly agreed when an attendee compared 30x30 to the Holodomor, a man-made famine that occurred in Ukraine during Soviet Union dictator Josef Stalin’s rule and resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3.9 million people. At that same event, Trent Loos, a Nebraska rancher and radio show host who served on former President Donald Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and now helps American Stewards with its campaign, compared 30x30 to Nazi Germany. And in its guide on how states, counties and local landowners can fight 30x30, American Stewards claims that “there is no credible scientific reasoning or facts that support the need to preserve any specific amount of land to ‘cure’ climate change.” Ricketts parroted that claim in a June interview with conservative radio host Dana Loesch, saying 30x30 is “not based on any science or data.” The world’s premier climate research body disagrees. In a sweeping report on climate impacts and vulnerability earlier this year, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that “maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas.” In many ways, American Stewards’ opposition push has already been a huge success. The group stoked fear in rural communities across the West and Midwest, elevating its own brand in the process. It convinced dozens of local government bodies to pass its prefabricated resolutions opposing 30x30: To date, more than 130 counties and other localities across 13 states have adopted the model resolutions, according to a tally on American Stewards’ website. And a growing number of Republican lawmakers and allied right-wing organizations are peddling the group’s talking points and working to drum up opposition. But few have proven themself a bigger champion of the cause than Ricketts. Center for Western Priorities dubbed him “the political hub of 30x30 disinformation.” It was a pleasure to join @benshapiro on his show to talk about how Nebraska is defending the Second Amendment and pushing back against President Biden’s anti-agriculture 30x30 plan. 🎙 Subscribe to the Ben Shapiro Show here: https://t.co/e31XIqKTIp pic.twitter.com/nAJdmLWQ9p In early April, about a month after Byfield briefed Ricketts at the state Capitol, she checked in with Gage, her contact in the governor’s office, to see how the letter he was spearheading against 30x30 was coming along. In an email to Gage, Byfield noted that she was going to be holding anti-30x30 events in Oklahoma, Montana and South Dakota in the coming weeks and offered to lend a hand if Gage needed to secure signatures from the governors of those states. While the emails do not indicate that Gage took her up on that offer or that Byfield was involved in crafting the opposition letter, they do show that Byfield had advance knowledge of Ricketts’ actions. “Governors have been responding positively,” Gage wrote. “I expect the final letter by April 16th.” A couple of weeks later, on April 21, Gage sent Byfield the finalized letter that Ricketts and 14 other Republican governors, including those from Oklahoma, Montana and South Dakota, had sent to Biden. In it, the group outlined their concerns and speculated that 30x30 would violate private property rights and damage local economies. Byfield praised the letter and thanked Ricketts for his leadership. She also informed Gage that she’d spoken earlier that day with a Fox News reporter who was pitching a story on 30x30 and offered to send the journalist the governors’ letter and Gage’s contact information. “Go for it!” Gage replied. “We’d be happy to go on Fox News to discuss.” Later that day, Byfield emailed the Fox reporter to connect him with Gage, who she described as “very well versed on 30x30.” When the reporter hadn’t reached out to Ricketts’ staff a week later, Byfield pondered “if it would be worthwhile to have some op-eds ready to go regardless of the direction of the story.” “Thinking we should try to take advantage of the national spotlight,” she told Gage. “I agree - we would be happy to team up on an op-ed,” Gage replied. The two brainstormed which outlets to target, including Fox News and The Wall Street Journal, but HuffPost could find no record of Ricketts publishing an opinion in either publication. He did, however, publish at least five columns about 30x30. The columns are circulated to all Nebraska papers and often get published. It wasn’t the only time that Byfield and Gage brainstormed media strategy. When a reporter from the Omaha World-Herald reached out to Byfield in early June to ask about her organization’s view of the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Bundy family’s government resistance, Byfield pinged Gage to ask if the reporter was “honest” and worth talking to. “I would just provide him written comment at this point,” Gage advised. “If he follows up again, we can visit further.” Byfield took his advice. It was around that same time in June that a reporter at the Daily Beast contacted the governor’s team to inquire about its relationship with American Stewards. Ricketts’ office pretended it had little if any knowledge of the right-wing group. “Reached for comment, Ricketts’ office requested more information on American Stewards,” the Daily Beast reported. By then, Gage had been consulting with American Stewards’ executive director about 30x30 for nearly four months. He’d already invited Byfield to speak on a panel about 30x30 at a 2-day agricultural summit the governor would host the following month — an invitation that Byfield promptly accepted. And Byfield was already pulling strings in the governor’s office to advance her own agenda. This influence is particularly clear in Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30 — the first of its kind in any state. Thank you to everyone who joined our #Stop30x30 Executive Order signing ceremony this afternoon. Working together, we can stop President @JoeBiden's radical land grab. pic.twitter.com/0BhiZF0ka9 In an email on May 27, Byfield flagged language in an order from Interior Secretary Deb Haaland that directed members of a newly created climate task force to collaborate and coordinate with states and local authorities. Byfield stressed that the provision could be a “powerful tool” for Nebraska to fight 30x30 and suggested a coordination provision be included in Ricketts’ upcoming executive order. When Gage circulated a “confidential one pager” in early June, Byfield drew attention to a Nebraska statute that requires all conservation and preservation easements to receive approval from the local county board or other appropriate government body. And she suggested the governor task the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture with making sure the U.S. Department of Agriculture was aware of requirements under state law. “We may even consider providing some recommended language for this,” she wrote. Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30, signed on June 24, has Byfield’s fingerprints all over it. The directive instructs the Nebraska Department of Revenue to “advise counties of their rights in reviewing conservation easements” pursuant to the statute Byfield underscored in her email. It designates Nebraska’s agricultural director as the state coordinator for the federal climate task force that Haaland established in her secretarial order. And it directs the state agriculture director to “coordinate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that the USDA is seeking proper local approvals for conservation easements” related to federal programs. Byfield was present at the signing ceremony. After months of backroom collaboration, the governor’s relationship with American Stewards became increasingly public. In September, Ricketts interviewed Byfield for a full hour on his podcast. Among other things, the two argued that an Interior Department fact sheet on 30x30 had lifted statistics — including that 1 million species are now at risk of extinction and that the U.S. is losing a football field-sized area of nature to development every 30 seconds — from a 2019 Center for American Progress report. (The extinction statistic is from a United Nations report. The loss of nature estimate is from a report that the Center for American Progress commissioned but that was conducted by Conservation Science Partners, a California-based science nonprofit.) “If they were writing a high school paper, they would have gotten a D for plagiarism,” chuckled Ricketts, whose public comments and writings have repeatedly mirrored those of American Stewards. Byfield and Gage remained in close contact through November. Then, suddenly, communication between the governor’s office and American Stewards stopped, according to records provided to HuffPost. When pressed about whether the governor’s office had complied with HuffPost’s requested date range, an adviser to the governor responded, “I presume the break in communication was likely due the resignation of Taylor Gage, Strategic Communications Specialist, on Dec. 3, 2021.” Gage was undoubtedly Byfield’s primary contact in Ricketts’ office. Still, internal emails indicate that Byfield and the governor’s office had started strategizing off-email long before Gage’s departure out of concern that their discussions could be made public via a records request. Byfield warned Gage about a watchdog group, Accountable.US, that had been filing records requests for American Stewards’ communications with counties in numerous states — “Your office may receive a similar request,” she wrote — and scrutinizing the group’s tax status. Accountable.US filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service in May accusing the group of violating its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by lobbying against 30x30 at the federal, state and local levels. In another back-and-forth in September, Gage flagged a USDA announcement about $75 million in investments for climate-smart agriculture and forestry projects on private lands, including one in Nebraska. “We need to respond...,” Byfield wrote. “Have several thoughts of what needs to go into this, but they are strategic and should not be subject to a [Freedom of Information Act] request. We could either visit by phone, or, loop in an attorney for the state so we trigger the attorney client privilege. Thoughts?” “Would you have time for a Zoom next week?” Gage asked.

13,"Crews Brace For Strong Winds, Explosive Fire Growth In West",environment," FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Firefighters fanned out across blackened landscape in Arizona’s high country, digging into the ground to put out smoldering tree stumps and roots as helicopters buzzed overhead with buckets of water to drop on a massive blaze. The work has been tedious and steady — all with the recognition that already strong winds will become stronger Friday and a shift over the weekend could turn the blaze back toward a mountainous tourist town. The 32-square-mile (83-square kilometer) blaze outside Flagstaff is one of a half-dozen major wildfires that have raced across Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters have warned that above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation combined with spring winds have elevated the chances for more catastrophic fires. The elements needed for critical fire weather are “pretty much on steroids in the atmosphere for tomorrow,” said Scott Overpeck with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque. “And by that we mean they are really cranked up. Everything is really overlapping together at the same time.” Red flag warnings were issued Thursday for much of northern Arizona and large portions of New Mexico as state and federal officials scrambled to get more crews on the front lines. With expected wind conditions, “it will prove challenging to put in those containment lines to stop fire growth,” said Jerolyn Byrne, a spokesperson for the team working the Flagstaff-area fire. “We’ll see some growth on the fire.” Neither officials nor residents have been able to fully survey the damage near Flagstaff, as crews on Thursday were busy wrestling a spot fire and trying to keep the flames from running up the mountainside. If that were to happen, it would mean a much bigger fire with long-term consequences such as erosion and flooding. Still, spirits were lifted Thursday as helicopters for the first time were able to start dropping water on the flames. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Flagstaff’s Coconino County. The declaration clears the way for state funding to be used for evacuations, shelter, repairs and other expenses. However, the money can’t be used to reimburse home and business owners for their losses. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of wildfires burning in the Southwest. Popular lakes and national monuments have been closed in Arizona — some because fire has moved directly over them. Local and federal land managers also have been imposing burn bans and fire restrictions on public lands. Wildfire has become a year-round threat in the West given changing conditions that include earlier snowmelt and rain coming later in the fall, scientist have said. The problems are exacerbated by decades of fire suppression and poor forest management along with a more than 20-year megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. Residents around Flagstaff questioned how a small blaze reported northeast of the college town Sunday afternoon ballooned to more than 30 square miles (77 square kilometers) in a matter of days. Matt McGrath, a district ranger on the Coconino National Forest, said firefighters had corralled the wildfire Sunday and didn’t see any smoke or active flames when they checked on it again Monday. By Tuesday, the wind was firmly in control. Flames emerged and jumped the containment line. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Smoldering stumps dotted the area where the fire was believed to have started. Preston Mercer, a fire management specialist with the Coconino National Forest, remembers standing on the same patch of ground in 2010, fighting another large blaze. Like that one, this fire has been taking advantage of dry vegetation and fierce winds. “The environment is not very friendly. It was blowing 70 mph. Rocks were hitting everybody in the face. It was very smoky and we were working directly in the heat,” he said of the conditions this week. “These guys are working incredibly hard. They know the values at risk. This is their community.” In neighboring New Mexico, crews were battling several fires, including two that had forced a small number of evacuations and one that was threatening natural gas and telecommunication lines. The fire danger also remained high in southern Colorado, where a wildfire destroyed an unknown number of homes on Wednesday in Monte Vista, a community of about 4,150 people surrounded by farm fields. Despite strong winds, firefighters stopped the fire from spreading by the evening but hot spots remained. Officials there said they were still assessing the damage Thursday but noted that six families had been displaced by the fire. About 25 structures have been lost in the Flagstaff-area fire. Coconino County officials late Wednesday pointed residents to a system where they could seek help with food, temporary housing and other needs. Some 765 homes were evacuated. Rocky Opliger, the incident commander on a wildfire that has burned about 3 square miles (7 square kilometers) and forced evacuations south of Prescott, Arizona, said the conditions are some of the worst he’s seen in nearly five decades of fighting wildland fires. “This is very early to have this kind of fire behavior,” he said. “Right now we are on the whims of weather.” ____ Associated Press writers Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, and Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report."
14,"This Earth Day, Biden Faces 'Headwinds' On Climate Agenda",environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — One year ago, Joe Biden marked his first Earth Day as president by convening world leaders for a virtual summit on global warming that even Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping attended. Biden used the moment to nearly double the United States’ goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, vaulting the country to the front lines in the fight against climate change. But the months since then have been marred by setbacks. Biden’s most sweeping proposals remain stalled on Capitol Hill despite renewed warnings from scientists that the world is hurtling toward a dangerous future marked by extreme heat, drought and weather. In addition, the war in Ukraine has reshuffled the politics of climate change, leading Biden to release oil from the nation’s strategic reserve and encourage more drilling in hopes of lowering sky-high gas prices that are emptying American wallets. It’s a far cry from the sprint toward clean energy that Biden — and his supporters — envisioned when he took office. Although Biden is raising fuel economy standards for vehicles and included green policies in last year’s bipartisan infrastructure legislation, the lack of greater progress casts a shadow over his second Earth Day as president. Biden will mark the moment in Seattle on Friday, where he’ll be joined by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat with a national reputation for climate action. Biden also is scheduled to visit Portland on Thursday as part of a swing through the Pacific Northwest, a region that has often been on the forefront of environmental efforts. Administration officials defend Biden’s record on global warming while saying that more work is needed. “Two things can be true at the same time,” said Ali Zaidi, the president’s deputy national climate adviser. “We can have accomplished a lot, and have a long way to go.” Zaidi acknowledged that “we have headwinds, we have challenges,” but also said the president has “a mandate to drive action forward on this.” Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, said Biden has not lived up to the promise of last year’s Earth Day summit. “Climate action was a pillar of President Biden’s campaign, and his promises on this existential issue were a major reason the public elected him,″ Tisdel said. ”Achieving results on climate is not a matter of domestic politics, it’s life and death.” Biden had hoped to pass a $1.75 trillion plan for expanding education programs, social services and environmental policies. But Republicans opposed the legislation, known as Build Back Better, and it  failed to get the unanimous support necessary from Democrats  holding a slim majority in the Senate. The final blow came from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who owes his personal fortune to coal and represents a state that defines itself in large part through mining that fossil fuel. Democrats hope to revive the bill in some form, but it’s unclear exactly what Manchin would support, putting any possible deal in jeopardy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that negotiations were ongoing even though Biden wasn’t publicizing them. “Just because he’s not talking about it doesn’t mean those conversations are not happening behind the scenes,” she said. Administration officials are expected to speak Saturday at a rally outside the White House as climate, labor and social justice groups urge Congress to pass climate legislation before Memorial Day. Similar events are planned in dozens of cities as activists stress the need for major investments to boost clean energy and create jobs. The White House wants to win approval for more than $300 billion in tax credits for clean energy that advocates describe as crucial for meeting Biden’s goal of reducing emissions by up to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030. Without the tax credits, “I don’t see a pathway,” said Nat Keohane, a former Obama energy adviser who is now president of the independent Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Reaching the midterm elections in November without them “would amount to a failure on the promise of the first year,″ he said. Asked if Biden’s goal of reducing emissions is still achievable, Psaki said, “We are continuing to pursue it, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to reach it.” Psaki noted that the  $1 trillion infrastructure law includes an array of climate policies, including funding for the construction of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. However, an analysis by the consultancy McKinsey estimates that nearly 30 million chargers are needed by 2030. The Ukraine war has worsened the political challenges at home by sending shockwaves through global energy markets and increasing gas prices. It’s also caused Biden to change his tune on oil drilling. Last week, Biden moved forward with the first onshore sales of oil and gas drilling leases  on public land, a move that environmental groups blasted even though the administration said it was only doing so under a court order. Although the legal battle is ongoing, in the meantime Biden is encouraging new domestic production. “The bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now,” Biden said in March. Pres. Biden: ‘The bottom line is, if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now’ pic.twitter.com/bEAjGKBKRg The leasing plan ""is an ugly betrayal of Joe Biden’s campaign promises and his administration’s rhetoric on environmental justice and climate action,″ said Collin Rees, U.S. political director at Oil Change International. “Biden is choosing to stand with polluters over people at the expense of frontline communities and the future of the planet,"" he added. The war in Ukraine has also frustrated diplomatic efforts to address climate change. John Kerry, Biden's international climate envoy, has focused much of his efforts on prodding China, the world's top consumer of coal, to transition to clean energy more quickly. But that work “is harder now” amid China's defense of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Kerry said Wednesday. “Some of the differences in opinion between our countries have sharpened and hardened, and that makes diplomacy more difficult,” he said during an online discussion on climate finance with the Center for Global Development. Kerry's aides have downplayed talk he might leave the administration now that he's served more than a year, and he remains a loyal defender of Biden's climate efforts. But his tone has become more pessimistic recently, especially as Biden's climate proposals remain stalled in Congress. The administration was also rattled by recent reports that Biden's domestic climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, plans to step down. McCarthy called the reports “simply inaccurate” and said she is “excited about the opportunities ahead.” Another one of Biden's climate-related efforts could divide the environmental community. His administration plans to offer $6 billion in funding to prevent financially distressed nuclear power plants from closing. Although the facilities produce carbon-free electricity, they’re viewed warily by some activists because of concerns about how to dispose of nuclear waste and the potential for devastating accidents. “We’re using every tool available to get this country powered by clean energy by 2035,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement. Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, said that “spirits have dimmed” after the failures of the past year. Although she praised some of the policies that Biden has achieved so far, she said that “it’s not at the scale of climate action we need — full-stop."" Now Republicans are poised to retake control of at least one chamber in Congress in November's midterm elections, meaning there's a limited window for making progress. Dillen and some other activists have suggested that Biden declare a climate emergency and use the Defense Production Act to boost renewable energy. ""It’s time to pull out all the stops,″ she said. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report."
15,'Wall Of Fire' Forces Evacuations Near Arizona Tourist Town,environment," FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Heavy winds kicked up a towering wall of flames outside a northern Arizona tourist town Tuesday, ripping through two-dozen structures and sending residents of more than 700 homes scrambling to flee. Flames as high as 100 feet (30 meters) raced through an area of scattered homes, dry grass and Ponderosa pine trees on the outskirts of Flagstaff as wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) pushed the blaze over a major highway. Coconino County officials said during an evening news conference that 766 homes and 1,000 animals had been evacuated. About 250 structures remained threatened in the area popular with hikers and off-road vehicle users and where astronauts have trained amid volcanic cinder pits. The county declared an emergency after the wildfire ballooned from 100 acres (40 hectares) Tuesday morning to over 9 square miles (23 square kilometers) by evening, and ash rained from the sky. The fire was moving northeast away from the more heavily populated areas of Flagstaff, home to Northern Arizona University, and toward Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith. “It’s good in that it’s not headed toward a very populated area, and it’s headed toward less fuel,” Smith said. “But depending on the intensity of the fire, fire can still move across cinders.” Authorities won’t be able to determine whether anyone was injured in the wildfire until the flames subside. Firefighters and law enforcement officers went door to door telling people to evacuate but had to pull out to avoid getting boxed in, said Coconino County Sheriff Jim Driscoll. He said his office got a call about a man who was trapped inside his house, but firefighters couldn’t get to him. “We don’t know if he made it out or not,” Driscoll said. Various organizations worked to set up shelters for evacuees and animals, including goats and horses. The scene was all too familiar for residents who recalled rushing to pack their bags and flee a dozen years ago when a much larger wildfire burned in the same area. “This time was different, right there in your backyard,” said Kathy Vollmer, a resident. She said she and her husband grabbed their three dogs but left a couple of cats behind as they faced what she described as a “wall of fire.” “We just hope they are going to be OK,” she said. Earlier in the day, the wildfire shut down U.S. 89, the main route between Flagstaff and far northern Arizona, and communities on the Navajo Nation. The high winds grounded aircraft that could drop water and fire retardant on the blaze. Arizona Public Service Co., the state’s largest utility, shut off power to about 625 customers to keep firefighters safe, a spokeswoman said. About 200 firefighters were battling the flames, but more are expected as a top-level national management team takes over later this week. The fire started Sunday afternoon 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff. Investigators don’t know yet what caused it and have yet to corral any part of the blaze. Ali Taranto rushed to Flagstaff from Winslow, where she works at a hospital, on Tuesday to check on a property she owns that was threatened by the wildfire. She also was getting messages to check on a neighbor who she found didn’t have access to oxygen while the power was out and didn’t have the strength to manually open her garage door to evacuate. Taranto said the neighbor was “disoriented and gasping for air” when she reached her. Firefighters in the area helped get the garage door open and the neighbor to the hospital, she said. Taranto was looking for a shelter for the neighbor’s two dogs. By the time Taranto left the area, the highway into Flagstaff was shut down and she had to drive an extra two hours back home. At least two other neighbors didn’t evacuate, she said. “To see flames several yards away from your property line and to hear the propane tanks bursting in the background, it was very surreal,” Taranto said. “Ash falling down. It was crazy.” The wind is expected to be a challenge the rest of the week, along with warmer-than-average weather and low humidity, the National Weather Service said. “I don’t see any significant decreases in wind, I don’t see any big bump ups in humidity and, at this point, we’re not really expecting any precipitation either,” said meteorologist Robert Rickey. Red flag warnings blanketed much of Arizona and New Mexico on Tuesday, indicating conditions are ripe for wildfires. Residents in northern New Mexico’s Mora and San Miguel counties were warned to be ready to evacuate as wildfires burned there amid dry, warm and windy conditions. The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that nearly 2,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel were assigned to more than a dozen large wildfires in the Southwestern, Southern and Rocky Mountain areas. Scientists say climate change has made the U.S. West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Elsewhere in Arizona, firefighters battled a wildfire in a sparsely populated area of the Prescott National Forest, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott. Cory Carlson, the incident commander with the Prescott National Forest, said late Tuesday afternoon the high winds have been the biggest challenge, sending embers into the air that sparked new spot fires near State Route 261, along with the demand for crews at other fires. “We do have a lack of resources,” he said. “There’s a lot of fires in the region.” Some areas were evacuated, and a shelter was set up at Yavapai College. Carlson appealed to residents to abide by evacuation orders. The cause of the 600-acre (2.4 square-kilometer) wildfire was under investigation. In southern Arizona, a principal highway route between Bisbee and Sierra Vista reopened Tuesday after being closed for about eight hours due to a brush fire in the hills overlooking Bisbee. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report."

0,Nearly 30% Of Americans Aren't Worried 'At All' About The Deadly Climate Crisis,environment," Reporter, HuffPost In an international survey of people’s responses to the climate crisis and other pressing issues, the country with the highest percentage of people who say they’re not worried about climate change “at all” turned out to be the United States. A survey released Monday by Ipsos found that about half of adults (48%) across 31 countries worry at least a fair amount about climate change. The survey of more than 23,000 adults worldwide, conducted online from mid-February to early March, asked people to what extent they’d worried about climate change in the past few weeks: a great deal, a fair amount, a little, or not at all? In Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Italy, more than two-thirds of respondents said they’d worried about climate change a great deal or a fair amount recently. In China and Russia, fewer than 30% said so. And in the United States, some 38% said they worried at least a fair amount about the climate crisis. However, 29% of Americans surveyed said they didn’t worry “at all” about climate change — a higher percentage than in any of the 30 other countries. Meanwhile, the climate crisis, which is very much real, is still ravaging the U.S. and other nations, bringing deadly — and worsening — droughts, fires, extreme heat, storms and floods. Last year alone, we saw the hottest July ever recorded on the planet (again), the largest single wildfire in California history (again), and devastating hurricanes and flooding along the Gulf of Mexico and the United States’ Eastern Seaboard (again). In the Ipsos survey, nearly three-quarters of Americans said that government (73%), businesses (73%) and individuals (71%) have a responsibility to reduce fossil fuel emissions to help avert the worst of the climate crisis. Over 60% said we need to act now, or we risk failing future generations (something the United Nations agrees with). Yet only about a quarter of American respondents believed the government has a clear plan to tackle the climate crisis. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,Cannabis Insiders Still High On Pot Business On 4/20 Despite Ongoing Challenges,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Although many cannabis consumers will be smoking the wacky weed on 4/20, industry insiders will mark the honorary holiday by focusing on a different kind of green ― or at least doing what’s needed to stay in business. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational cannabis in the U.S. Since then, 16 other states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational purposes. Currently, medical marijuana is legal in 37 states and Washington, D.C., but five states have only legalized the use of CBD oil: Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Considering cannabis laws vary from state to state and it is still illegal on the federal level, it’s not surprising that political issues top the list of challenges industry insiders face. Elliot Lewis, founder and CEO of Catalyst Cannabis, which operates a number of dispensaries in Southern California, says that politicians in his state aren’t doing enough to help the industry. “The leaders in [Sacramento] are greedy pigs,” Lewis said, adding that they could “care less about an industry” that he says could easily produce another 300,000 jobs. In particular, he noted the high state and local taxes placed on consumers and businesses. Those can add as much as $38 to $100 worth of legal weed, according to KCRW.com. Things are even more challenging on the federal level, where cannabis remains illegal. Matte Namer, the CEO and founder of Cannabeta Realty, a commercial real estate brokerage firm on the East Coast specializing in cannabis, says the current political climate doesn’t seem favorable to decriminalizing pot or legalizing it. “The Senate simply does not appear to have 50 votes let alone the 60 votes required to override a filibuster,” Namer told HuffPost via email. “We are hopeful that [the SAFE Banking Act] (which would give the cannabis industry much greater access to banking) may pass the Senate this year, however, politicians and activists are very divided as to whether any cannabis legislation should be passed that does not significantly advance issues of social justice.” Matt Costa, CEO of Wonderbrett, a Los Angeles-based cannabis company, agrees that the government needs to emphasize helping people and communities negatively affected by the war on drugs. “Although we cannot reverse the decades of injustice waged on Americans, and in particular communities of color, releasing and expungement of all incarcerated is necessary,” Costa told HuffPost in an email. “More importantly, providing thoughtful and obtainable resources to truly help restore the affected is what’s needed, because their sentences don’t really end after getting out of prison.” Costa says the industry should provide licensing opportunities, job training and various other forms of aid to those marginalized for decades, but added that there have to be “significant bills” that truly help these communities. “And that is just the start.” As Namer mentioned, banking is a key issue for the industry. Most banks don’t want to involve themselves in a business considered illegal at the federal level, which makes it hard for pot businesses to get access to capital. “For goodness sake it is 2022. The fact that we still can’t legally bank is unacceptable,” Barry Walker, CEO of Tradecraft Farms in California, griped to HuffPost. “Yes, [the SAFE Banking Act] has passed in the House several times before but we feel like there is momentum this time. Or maybe I just tell myself that so I can sleep at night.” Surprisingly, gas prices aren’t as big of an issue for many “cannabusinesses.” Tim Shaw, chief operating officer of MariMed, a multistate cannabis operator, says he’s surprised that the price of gas is having “a negligible impact” on production. “We thought higher gas prices might impact dispensary traffic because people may be driving less, but we haven’t seen that yet,” he told HuffPost. However, Jesus Burrola, the CEO of POSIBL, a cannabis farm in Salinas, California, says consumer price hikes are coming. “We have already seen distribution and last mile deliveries adjust their rates as a result of gas prices, and have also seen increases in construction materials that are over 30%,” Burrola said. “This will eventually have an effect on consumer prices.” But while the marijuana market is still growing big, insiders say it’s a long way off before dispensaries become as ubiquitous as 7-Elevens and McDonald’s in the U.S. “It will be a long time before there is a dispensary on every corner. Probably decades,” Walker told HuffPost. “In the meantime companies like ours write very good policy and introduce it to city councils and hope that they will adopt or negotiate some sort of legal cannabis policy.” Steven Jung, chief operating officer of the vaporizer company PAX, says the priority should be on consumer access. “What we really need to be focused on right now is ensuring that consumers actually have access to legal cannabis,” he told HuffPost. “That’s not the case everywhere, particularly in large markets like California, where we’re seeing cannabis deserts and the resulting sustainment of the illicit market.” Luke Anderson, co-founder of Cann, a THC-infused beverage, said the long-term prognosis looks good for the industry, but there might be a short-term slump. “Long range, I’m as confident as ever,” Anderson told HuffPost. “Short-term? Everyone should tighten their belts a bit while we explore whether federal legalization is a this-administration thing, a next-administration thing, or a next-next administration thing. I think it’s equally likely to happen in all three scenarios.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Park Employees Have Identified 6 ‘National Treasures’ That Need Saving,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost An organization representing current and former National Park Service employees is calling for President Joe Biden to use his executive power to establish several new national monuments around the country and advance his goal of conserving 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030. TheCoalition to Protect America’s National Parks published a report Tuesday that identifies six “national treasures in need of protection” and urges Biden to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 to make it happen. Those sites include Castner Range, a 7,000-acre former military weapon testing facility east of El Paso that is home to archeological sites and a diversity of wildlife, and Avi Kwa Ame, meaning “Spirit Mountain” in the Mojave language, an area of southern Nevada that is sacred to 12 Native American tribes. Signed into law in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act authorizes the president to “declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.” Sixteen presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used it to create more than 150 monuments. But in recent years, the Antiquities Act and monument designations have become political lightning rods. The Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers in Western states have condemned what they argue are abuses of the act meant to “lock up” federal lands and waters. That anti-monument sentiment culminated with then-President Donald Trump dismantling three sites: Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the East Coast. In October, however, Biden reversed the Trump-era rollbacks, restoring the sites to their original boundaries and reinstating more stringent protections. On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to not only reverse Trump’s monument rollbacks but also to establish new protected sites to combat global climate change and safeguard ecologically important landscapes. He signed an executive order shortly after taking office that set a goal of protecting 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.” And last May, the administration published a report outlining its vision for a 10-year “locally led” effort to conserve and restore lands and waters, slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and address inequalities in who has access to nature and the outdoors. But more than a year into his term, Biden has yet to designate a new monument — even as his administration works to advance its 30x30 conservation target. ​​Mike Murray, chair of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, told HuffPost that the Antiquities Act is an important conservation tool and that his organization is disappointed national monuments have not been a bigger part of the 30x30 discussion. “It’s time for the administration to make use of the Antiquities Act and to protect some of these special sites,” he said. The coalition is pushing for the designation of six monuments to safeguard a range of natural, cultural and historical resources. Along with Castner Range and Avi Kwa Ame, the group’s wish list includes: There is local support for monument designations at all six sites. To come up with the list, the coalition formed a working group of people with various backgrounds and expertise, and sought feedback from its membership. The result, Murray said, is a list of proposals that are achievable and would protect a variety of sites in different parts of the country “Perhaps it’s the first round of recommendations,” Murray said. “We just hope to get the conversation started and encourage the admin, with the time they have left, to move forward.” The coalition’s 13-page report, titled “In Support of the Antiquities Act: The Lasting Impacts of National Monuments,” does not advocate for specific monument acreages or quantify how much closer new designations would get the Biden administration to its 30x30 target. It does, however, highlight how many of America’s iconic national parks were first protected as national monuments, including the Grand Canyon, Alaska’s Glacier Bay and California’s Death Valley. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland traveled last month to Castner Range, where she hiked adjacent lands and met with local officials “to learn about their vision for increasing access to, and conservation of, outdoor spaces,” the Department of the Interior said in a press release at the time. The range remains off-limits to the public due to unexploded ordnance from years of military testing. But the White House has not signaled that it is planning to protect Castner Range or any other site via presidential proclamation. Neither the White House nor the Interior Department would comment on the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks’ proposal. In addition to Tuesday’s report, more than 300 members of the coalition signed on to a letter Tuesday calling for the administration to create new monuments and “continue to build an inclusive and resilient conservation legacy that reflects the diversity of our natural heritage and permanently protects our lands and waters.” “Many of us have served at national parks across the country that were first protected as national monuments,” says the letter, addressed to Biden, Haaland and Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality. “Thanks to the use of the Antiquities Act, irreplaceable natural and cultural resources have been protected for the enjoyment of future generations.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Biden Has Reversed A Trump-Era Rewrite Of One Key Environmental Law,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden’s White House on Tuesday finalized its reversal of the Trump administration’s industry-friendly overhaul of one of America’s bedrock environmental laws. The new rules from the White House Council on Environmental Quality restore key provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, requiring federal agencies to once again evaluate climate impacts when reviewing pipelines, power plants, airports and other infrastructure projects. “Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time,” CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory said in a statement. “Patching these holes in the environmental review process will help projects get built faster, be more resilient, and provide greater benefits to people who live nearby.” NEPA is a 50-year-old law that protects air, water and land by requiring federal regulators to conduct detailed environmental assessments of major infrastructure projects. The Trump-era changes, finalized in 2020, were the first major update to the law in more than four decades, part of a broad administrative effort to fast-track energy projects and other development. Along with allowing agencies to ignore climate impacts, the rewrite largely cut out the public from the environmental review process. Critics condemned the Trump administration’s overhauls as an attack on environmental justice, as NEPA is a primary avenue for communities, often composed of low-income individuals and people of color, to oppose projects that could endanger the environment and public health. Under the Biden administration’s new rule, agencies must account for all environmental impacts, including how greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution could further harm communities already suffering from disproportionate environmental effects. The rule also “restores the full authority of agencies to work with communities to develop and analyze alternative approaches that could minimize environmental and public health costs.” The White House said the rules unveiled Tuesday are the first of two phases of regulations to strengthen the environmental law. Environmental groups were quick to applaud the move. Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment at the Center for American Progress, called it “a critical first step in rolling back changes made under the previous administration that undermined public input and scientific integrity.” “Now, it’s time to urgently move to the next phase in restoring protections for the environmental review process,” she said. “That means making sure the process is clear, effective, and inclusive so that President Biden’s planned buildout of clean energy capacity can continue smoothly.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby with a long history of opposing climate regulations, warned that the changes would only add to an already burdensome infrastructure approval process. “With rapidly rising inflation, major supply chain disruptions and workforce shortages, the last thing our country needs is unnecessarily extensive and duplicative bureaucratic red tape and delayed project approvals,” Marty Durbin, the chamber’s senior vice president of policy, said in a statement. Tuesday’s announcement comes as many climate and environmental advocates are growing increasingly frustrated with Biden’s record on climate. In a call with reporters on Monday, a senior administration official criticized the media and pundits, saying they have sought to declare Biden’s climate agenda dead.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Bloody-Belly Comb Jelly Caught Pooping For The First Time -- And It Sparkles!,environment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Here’s a sight that’s probably never been caught on camera before: the bloody-belly comb jelly in the middle of a jelly dump. The Monterey Bay Aquarium posted the footage on its Twitter feed this week, noting that the jelly’s poops actually sparkle. “Move over, unicorns,” the organization wrote in a followup tweet: This may well be the world’s first-ever video of a bloody-belly comb jelly pooping! pic.twitter.com/QR0cTzGiqD The bloody-belly comb jelly, which is a ctenophore and not a true jelly, is featured in the aquarium’s new exhibition, Into the Deep. “Ironically, at the depths where the bloody-belly lives, it’s nearly invisible to predators,” the aquarium noted on its website. “In the darkness of the deep sea, animals that are red appear black and blend into the dark background.” Since the bloody-belly comb jelly’s prey can be bioluminescent, that blood-red gut hides what it ate, thus hiding the jelly, too. “A predator with a glowing gut could easily become prey,” the website said. George Matsumoto, the marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) who discovered the bloody-belly comb jelly in 2003, told the Mercury News that he didn’t think it could ever be displayed as it would melt when collected. “I never had an intact specimen. I never saw it under a microscope,” he said. “It was so sensitive to temperature change, I thought it couldn’t be displayed.” As a result, he estimated that only two dozen people had observed the bloody-belly comb jelly while it was alive ― until now. And if they’re lucky, they might even see it release sparkly unicorn poops.

11,Taylor Swift Gets A New Species Of Millipede Named After Her,environment," Reporter, HuffPost Taylor Swift has one of the biggest music careers of all time, but she now has something very tiny named after her. The newly discovered Nannaria swiftae ― a brown and orange millipede discovered in a Tennessee forest ― got its name honoring the 11-time Grammy winner thanks to the Swift-loving scientist who identified it. “I’m a big fan of Taylor’s music, and I listened to her music a lot during graduate school,” entomologist Derek Hennen told HuffPost on Monday. “It brought me joy and helped me through some difficult times, so I wanted to show my appreciation. Since this new species is from Tennessee and she lived in Tennessee for a while, I thought it was a nice fit.” This new millipede species is Nannaria swiftae: I named it after @taylorswift13! I'm a big fan of her music, so I wanted to show my appreciation by naming this new species from Tennessee after her. A high honor! pic.twitter.com/fXml3xX5Vs The wriggly arthropod, which will also go by the common name of Swift twisted-claw millipede, is one of 17 new species revealed in a study published last week by Hennen and other researchers at Virginia Tech. The explanation for the name is included in the study, which says the millipede was named in recognition of Swift’s “talent as a songwriter and performer and in appreciation of the enjoyment her music” brought to Hennen. We can’t help but see some similarities between the Nannaria swiftae and the singer’s “Evermore” album cover, where Swift’s plaid coat echoes the color palette of the bug and she rocks a French braid that doesn’t not look like a millipede. She hasn’t spoken up about her eponymous bug yet, but Hennen is hopeful she appreciates what a tribute this is. “I know not everyone likes bugs quite as much as I do, but I hope she thinks it’s a nice gesture,” he said. “For us scientists, we consider it a huge honor to have a species named after you, and I hope she feels the same way.” It’s hard to pick just one favorite Swift song, Hennen said, but currently it’s “either ‘Betty’ from her ‘Folklore’ album or ‘New Romantics’ from ‘1989.’” The singer’s namesake millipede was “collected in mesic forests with hemlock, maple, oak, tuliptree, witch hazel, and pine” ― and if that’s not fodder for lyrics on a “Folklore” or “Evermore” bonus track, we don’t know what is. Hennen and his team have played a huge role in expanding the number of species in the Nannaria wilsoni genus of millipedes, which thrive in Appalachia’s moist valleys. “In the past two years, my colleagues and I have described 54 new species in the genus, which now has 78 species!” he wrote in an email to HuffPost. “These millipedes aren’t as large and flashy as others in the family Xystodesmidae, commonly known as the cherry millipedes, due to their chemical defenses, which smell like cherries or almonds.” The Nannaria swiftae looks similar to other twisted-claw millipedes, Hennen explained, but is differentiated by modified legs on the males. Millipedes may be tiny ― the ones in this genus are only about half an inch to 1½ inches (15 to 38 millimeters) long ― but they play a key role in the forest ecosystem. They’re responsible for breaking down organic matter on the forest floor, such as dead leaves, preventing it from piling up and helping nutrients and carbon cycle through living and non-living parts of the ecosystem. They also play an important role in loosening soil as they burrow small tunnels. Lucky for the Swift-named millipede, it’s residing in a pretty safe habitat. “One of the places we found the millipede is a state park, which is great for conservation purposes because that means the millipede has protected land to live on,” Hennen said. “We worry about the survival of some of these millipede species with small distributions because if their habitat disappears, they don’t have many other places to go.” Reporter, HuffPost"
12,'We’ve Been Trying To Warn You': Fed-Up Scientists Get Arrested Demanding Climate Action,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Scientists in multiple countries protested to demand real government action on climate change, with some engaging in dramatic civil disobedience like chaining themselves to a bank door or gluing their hands to a government building. “I’m willing to take a risk for this gorgeous planet, for my sons,” Peter Kalmus, a biological systems and climate change scientist at NASA, told Insider. “We’ve been trying to warn you guys for so many decades that we’re heading towards a fucking catastrophe, and we’ve been being ignored.” That’s why Kalmus and three others chained themselves to an office building of Chase Bank (JPMorgan Chase has invested more money in fossil fuels than any other bank) last week in Los Angeles. Kalmus, along with a physicist, an engineer and a science teacher, were all arrested by Los Angeles police clad in riot gear, according to LAist. I'm grateful we tried. Man, oh, man, did we try. pic.twitter.com/TlYrwwGB8v “The paradigm is starting to shift for scientists,” soil scientist Rose Abramoff told Earther. Abramoff was also arrested last week after chaining herself to a White House fence alongside other protesters. She said she had previously taken pains to “remain unbiased,” but that “it’s not political to tell the truth. Serving the habitability of life on this planet is not and should not be a political issue.” Scientist Rebellion estimated that around 1,000 activists ― including both scientists and nonscientists who also participated ― from 25 countries took part in the protests. In London, 25 people glued scientific papers ― and some their own hands ― to the windows of the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, The Guardian reported. “The government’s insane, and I don’t know what to do, other than to do this, to try and get the attention that we need to wake the public up,” ecologist Aaron Thierry said, his hand superglued to the window pane. “The government’s insane, and I don’t know what to do, other than to do this, to try and get the attention that we need to wake the public up.”Ecologist Dr Aaron Thierry (@ThierryAaron), who has his hand superglued to the window at @beisgovuk with @ScientistsX pic.twitter.com/Hx8oAvZZgC In Spain, protesters threw fake blood on the Spanish Parliament steps in Madrid. The activist group said 53 people ― about half of the people at the demonstration ― were arrested. Fernando Valladares, a research professor with the Spanish National Research Council, told Euro News that it’s not just “the future” that’s in peril due to the warming planet, it’s “the present” as well. “Crop failures, migrations, and marine flooding. What else do we need to know?” he said. The mass action followed the release of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report. The report warned that “it’s now or never” for the world to take sharp action to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a goal set by the Paris climate accords.

13,Climate Change Activists Climb Atop Oil Tanker In Mass Protests In London,environment," LONDON (AP) — Six people have been arrested after climate change activists climbed onto an oil tanker in central London to protest investments in fossil fuel, British police said Saturday. The Extinction Rebellion climate activism group said two Olympic athletes — gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott and Laura Baldwin — were among those protesting Friday. The oil tanker protest was part of mass climate demonstrations Friday that saw hundreds of activists blocking four key bridges across the British capital, causing delays and disruption across central London. Extinction Rebellion said thousands of people are expected at London’s Hyde Park on Saturday for more protests. More than 600 people have been arrested over the past two weeks after environmental activists climbed atop oil tankers, padlocked themselves to structures and blocked roads at oil depots across the U.K. The group Just Stop Oil, which is affiliated with Extinction Rebellion, is demanding that Britain’s Conservative government stop any new oil and gas projects. The demonstrations are part of a growing climate action movement that has also seen the group Insulate Britain obstruct highways and roads to press its demands that the government fund more energy-efficient homes. The demands have become more urgent as energy prices are skyrocketing in the U.K. and elsewhere. A spokesperson for Shell said the company respects “the right of everyone to express their point of view –- we only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others in mind.” “We agree that society needs to take urgent action on climate change. Shell has a clear target to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, in step with society,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, police in central England said nine people were charged after Just Stop Oil held a demonstration Friday at an oil terminal in Kingsbury, near the city of Birmingham."
14,Bald Eagles Are The Latest Victims Of Deadly Bird Flu Spreading Across U.S.,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A highly contagious and deadly strain of avian flu spreading among farms and wild birds in the United States has been claiming the lives of bald eagles. Three bald eagles found dead in Georgia tested positive for the new influenza strain, H5N1, the state’s department of natural resources announced this week. The statement also noted that a survey of bald eagles near Georgia’s coast found more “failed nests” than expected, some containing dead eaglets. It wasn’t immediately clear if nest failures were due to avian flu. Over the past month, H5N1 has also killed eagles in Maine, Ohio, South Dakota and Vermont, NPR reported. Wildlife rehabilitation center Back to the Wild said earlier in April that a dozen deathly ill eagles had been brought in, typically too sick to fly and unsteady on their feet. “All of them died within hours of admission,” Back to the Wild assistant director Heather Tuttle told local news station WTVG. “One actually died within minutes of admission. When it comes to avian influenza we’ve not had an outbreak like this in our area.” Once deeply endangered in the lower 48 states, bald eagles are widely considered a major conservation success story. Steve Holmer of the American Bird Conservancy noted in 2018, however, that while eagles are no longer classified as endangered, people must “stay vigilant” to continue to protect the birds. H5N1 has been detected in 25 states and has also been found in myriad other wild birds, including owls, geese, ducks and vultures. But its biggest toll has been on domestic chickens and turkeys. More than 20 million birds have been killed on farms where the flu has been detected in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, zoos across North America have been keeping their birds inside, fearing that the virus could be devastating if any of the avian residents caught it. Health officials have said that the risk to human health at this time is low. There’s been only one known case of H5N1 in humans, a person in England who raised birds and was asymptomatic.

15,"New Mexico Wildfire Spurs Evacuation Order For 5,000 People",environment," Douglas Siddens’ mother was among those who made it out with just the clothes on her back when a deadly, wind-fueled wildfire ripped through a mountain community in southern New Mexico. The RV park where she lived was reduced to “metal frame rails and steel wheels,” said Siddens, who managed the site “I had like 10 people displaced. They lost their homes and everything, including my mom,” he said. The fire has destroyed more than 200 homes and killed two people since it broke out Tuesday near the village Ruidoso, a vacation spot that draws thousands of tourists and horse racing fans every summer. Hundreds of homes and summer cabins dot the surrounding mountainsides. The RV park that Siddens managed is near where an elderly couple was found dead this week outside their charred residence. Elsewhere in the U.S., crews have been battling large fires this week in Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado, where a new blaze forced evacuations Friday along the Rocky Mountain’s eastern front near Lyons about 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Boulder. That fire was burning in the Blue Mountains near the Larimer-Boulder county line about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Estes Park, the east entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. In New Mexico, power was restored to all but a few hundred customers, but evacuation orders for close to 5,000 people remained in place. Donations poured in from surrounding communities all too familiar with just how devastating wildfires can be. It was a decade ago that fire ripped through part of the village of Ruidoso, putting the vacation spot on the map with the most destructive wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history when more than 240 homes burned and nearly 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) of forest were blackened by a lightning-sparked blaze. On Friday, Mayor Lynn Crawford was rallying heartbroken residents once again as firefighters tried to keep wind-whipped flames from making another run at the village. She said the response from their neighbors has been amazing. “So we have plenty of food, we have plenty of clothes, those kinds of things but we still appreciate and need your prayers and your thoughts,” the mayor said during a briefing. “Again, our hearts go out to the family of the deceased, to those that have lost their homes.” Authorities have yet to release the names of the couple who died. Their bodies were found after worried family members contacted police, saying the couple had planned to evacuate Tuesday when the fire exploded but were unaccounted for later that day. While many older residents call Ruidoso home year round, the population of about 8,000 people expands to about 25,000 during the summer months as Texans and New Mexicans from hotter climates seek respite. Fans also flock to Ruidoso Downs, home to one of the sport’s richest quarter-horse competitions. The racing season was expected to start May 27, and horses that board there aren’t in any danger as fire officials use the facility as a staging ground. Part-time residents have taken to social media over the last few days, pleading with fire officials for updates on certain neighborhoods, hoping their family cabins weren’t among those damaged or destroyed. The hotlines lit up Friday afternoon as people in the village called in to report more smoke. Fire information officer Mike DeFries said that was because there were flare-ups within the interior of the fire as the flames found pockets of unburned fuel. While the fire didn’t make any runs at the lines crews had established, he said it was still a tough day for firefighters due to single-digit humidity, warmer temperatures and the wind. Authorities reiterated that it was still too early to start letting people in to see the damage. They asked for patience as fire crews put out hot spots and tried to build a stronger perimeter around the blaze. “It’s still an active fire area in there and it’s not a safe place,” DeFries said. “It’s going to require patience. At the same time, every step that we’re taking is designed to suppress this fire and to get people back home as soon as possible.” New Mexico authorities said they suspect the fire, which has torched more than 9.5 square miles (24 square kilometers) of forest and grass, was sparked by a downed power line and the investigation continued Friday. Hotter and drier weather coupled with decades of fire suppression have contributed to an increase in the number of acres burned by wildfires, fire scientists say. The problem is exacerbated by a more than 20-year Western megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. ___ Cedar Attanasio contributed reporting from Santa Fe.

0,People On Texas Beach Tried To 'Ride' Stranded Dolphin That Later Died,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Federal officials in Texas are investigating beachgoers’ harassment of a stranded female dolphin that later died. According to witnesses, some individuals on Quintana Beach on the Gulf of Mexico some 6 miles east of Freeport dragged the bottlenose dolphin back into the water last Sunday, then “attempted to swim with and ride the sick animal,” the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network said in a statement on Facebook. “She ultimately stranded” again and was “further harassed by a crowd of people on the beach where she died before rescuers could arrive on scene,” the statement added. Quintana Beach County Park officials called the death a “tragedy.” “Dolphins strand because they are sick or injured, and will most likely drown if returned to sea or re-strand in worse condition,” Heidi Whitehead, executive director of stranding network, told the Houston Chronicle. Harassing marine mammals, which are federally protected, is illegal, she noted. All pertinent information about the dolphin has been forwarded to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which investigates cases of harassment. Violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act is punishable by up to a year in prison and as much as $11,000 in fines. In other tragic dolphin news, a lactating bottlenose still nursing was found dead last month on Fort Myers Beach in Florida with a wound above her right eye. She was apparently impaled in the head with a spearlike object while still alive, officials told local news station WESH 2. They are continuing to investigate the death. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Biden To Resume Oil And Gas Lease Sales On Federal Land While Upping Royalties,environment," BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Biden administration is sharply raising rates for royalties companies pay on oil and natural gas extracted from federal lands as it moves forward under court order with sales of public fossil fuel reserves in nine states, Interior Department officials said Friday. The announcement comes as Republicans pressure President Joe Biden to expand U.S. crude production and rein in higher gasoline prices contributing to record inflation. Biden also faces calls from within his own party to do more to curb emissions from fossil fuels that are driving climate change. The royalty rate for new leases will increase to 18.75%, from the current 12.5%. That’s a 50% percent jump and marks the first increase to royalties for the government in decades. Leases for 225 square miles (580 square kilometers) of federal lands primarily in the West will be offered for sale in a notice to be posted on Monday, officials said. That’s about 30 % less land than officials had earlier proposed for sale  in November and less than what was originally nominated by the industry. The sales notices will cover leasing decisions in nine states — Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Montana, Alabama, Nevada, North Dakota and Oklahoma. Interior Department officials declined to specify which states would have parcels for sale or to give a breakdown of the amount of land by state, saying that information would be included in Monday’s sales notice. Burning fossil fuels extracted from public lands accounts for about 20% of energy-related U.S. emissions, making them a prime target for climate activists who want to shut down leasing. Republicans want more drilling, saying it would increase U.S. energy independence and help bring down the cost of crude. But oil companies have been hesitant to expand drilling because of uncertainty over how long high prices will continue. The onshore lease sales will be the first by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management since Biden suspended them just a week after taking office in January 2021, as part of his plan to address climate change. The administration was ordered last year to resume the sales by a federal judge in Louisiana, who said Interior officials offered no “rational explanation” for canceling them. Hundreds of parcels of public land that companies nominated for leasing had been previously dropped from the upcoming lease sale because of concerns about wildlife being harmed by drilling rigs."
2,Missing Wallaby Found Hiding In Bush Near Memphis Zoo Exhibit,environment," Honey Bunch, the wallaby who went missing at the Memphis Zoo after storms passed through Tennessee this week, has been found hiding — nearly in plain sight. “It was an area right behind the exhibit ... that had been searched multiple times in the past 36 hours, but he was camouflaged really well and hidden very well under a bush,” said Jessica Faulk, the zoo’s spokesperson. A curator happened to see some tracks Friday morning and followed them to Honey Bunch, Faulk said. “We suspect he was there the whole time,” she said. Honey Bunch was taken to the zoo’s hospital and was being evaluated by a veterinarian, who gave him a clean bill of health, Faulk said. A creek in the KangaZoo exhibit overflowed during storms Wednesday night, and the exhibit was evacuated, with the animals moved to the hospital. Honey Bunch and three other wallabies will move back to the exhibit together in a day or so probably, Faulk said. Honey Bunch is 21 months old and one of the largest of the four, she said. Faulk said no one knows how he was able to get out of the exhibit’s fencing but that zoo officials are looking into it so they can prevent it from happening again. Memphis police had assisted in the search for the missing animal, a smaller relative of the kangaroo."
3,2 Dead California Mountain Lion Kittens Test Positive For Rat Poison,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Two mountain lion kittens who died after they were found at a southern California office park tested positive for rat poison, the National Park Service reported. They were part of a litter of four who were orphaned or abandoned and discovered under a picnic table last November in the Thousand Oaks complex. All females, the wild felines were just 6 weeks old. According to necropsy results reported Wednesday by the Park Service, Cubs P-100 and P-102 were found to have three types of rat poison in their systems. They were also emaciated and suffered from inflammation of their brains and feline parvovirus. Parvo is highly contagious and can cause feline panleukopenia and death, particularly in young kittens. Cubs P-100 and P-102 died a short time after they were found. P-101 and P-103 survived and are now living in the Orange County Zoo. Although researchers have been studying mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area since 2002, the kittens provided them with unique information. “This is the first time a mountain lion in the park’s 20-year study has been affected by parvo, and these two kittens are the youngest mountain lions in the study to have anticoagulant rodenticides in their system,” biologist Jeff Sikich, who’s in charge of fieldwork for the study, said in a statement. Officials told The Los Angeles Times that the kittens “died of abandonment; a major cause of their emaciated condition postmortem was the lack of care from their mother.” An office worker discovered the litter and contacted wildlife officials. He was told to leave the kittens be in the hope that they would return to the open space and reunite with their mother. The kittens were eventually tagged, collared and numbered P-100 through P-103 by the Park Service and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. They were rescued a few days later when biologists noticed that one of the kittens was in poor health. P-100 and P-102 were taken to a veterinary hospital and died overnight. “We did everything we could to reunite these kittens with their mother, but I’m afraid she was already dead or abandoned them,” Sikich said last year.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"Memphis Zoo, Police Search For Missing Wallaby Lost After Storm",environment," MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Police and the Memphis Zoo searched Thursday for a wallaby that was missing after heavy rain caused flooding inside an exhibit. The zoo said a creek in its KangaZoo exhibit overflowed during thunderstorms Wednesday, leading staff to evacuate animals to an animal hospital. After counting the animals, staff found that one wallaby was missing, and a search began, the zoo said in a news release. The Memphis Police Department is helping the search for the missing wallaby, which are smaller relatives of the kangaroo and are fairly skittish, the zoo said. Anyone who sees the wallaby is asked to call the zoo and describe the location and time where it was spotted."
11,NYC’s Controversial Big Clean-Energy Project Just Got The Green Light,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost New York state regulators on Thursday approved two massive transmission projects to carry clean electricity into New York City, boosting hopes that the nation’s largest city could start to meaningfully wean off fossil fuels this decade. At a hearing in Albany, five out of the state Public Service Commission’s seven members voted in favor of a proposal to construct power lines from hydroelectric dams in Québec and upstate New York solar and wind farms. Once completed, the two projects combined are expected to reduce New York City’s demand for fossil fuels by 51%. “Simply put, if we can’t deliver renewable energy to New York City, we can’t reduce emissions from the fossil fuel fleet,” Rory Christian, the commission’s chairman and lone appointee who hails from New York City, said at the hearing. “Should we delay and reconsider our approach at another time, we’ll very likely run the risk of putting ourselves in the unenviable position of paying more for future projects with lesser benefits.” This final approval gives Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), who is campaigning for a full term in office this year, a major climate victory as she heads into a primary election she’s currently favored to win. “New York continues to lead the nation with innovative green energy initiatives and has been an example to the rest of the world how to confront the perils of climate change, the existential threat of our time,” Hochul said in a statement. “Today’s decision is a major step forward.” Clean Path New York, a 175-mile line from a substation in New York’s Delaware County into the borough of Queens, generated little controversy, but carried greater risks, as the project has yet to receive permits and won’t come online until 2027 at the earliest. By contrast, the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a 339-mile conduit from hydro dams in Canada to the Queens neighborhood of Astoria, stoked heated challenges from a ragtag alliance of environmentalists, gas-fired generators and Indigenous groups. The opposition cited concerns ranging from the costs to New York ratepayers and competition to New York energy companies, to fears that Hydro-Québec, the government-owned utility behind the project, might prioritize Canadians in a disaster or repeat its dark history of seizing Indigenous lands in Canada to build more dams and increase its electricity output. Critics also raised issues with the current contract, which does not obligate Hydro-Québec to sell the same amount of power to the city during winter months, when electricity demand is forecast to peak at some point in the next few decades. Currently, New York City’s power demand surges in the summertime, when air conditioning to fend off the sweltering heat spikes. As the city moves away from gas for heating, electric heat pumps are expected to make demand soar the highest during the cold months. But the company, and economic analysts working for the state commission, downplayed that concern, noting that the utility would have a financial incentive to make more money selling power when demand was high. Still, intrastate regional rivalries took center stage in the debate, with commissioners from upstate arguing that New York City would receive virtually all the benefits as ratepayers in the state’s poorer, northern reaches would possibly see increases to their electric bills. Complaining that “nary a word” was said about the projects in upstate media, Commissioner John Howard — the former chairman, who was demoted after he refused Hochul’s pressure to resign from the panel — said “this lack of proactive outreach is to say, at the very least, troubling.” “Even today, we heard over and over again the vast majority of benefits to this proposal accrue to New York City,” Howard said. Supporters of the project countered that the New York City government had already budgeted tens of millions of dollars to help finance the project, and a landmark municipal law passed in 2019, requiring large buildings to slash energy use, also incentivized landlords to help pay for the hydro line. Another state agency, the Office of General Services, had also signaled it was going to make a deal to help pay for the project. Commissioner Diane Burman said those commitments were not firm enough, and were thus “troubling and unacceptable.” “I struggle with being able to approve these contracts at a time when consumers all across this state are already experiencing rising supply costs and record-high inflation,” she said. But Commissioner Tracey Edwards — who, coming from Long Island, was the only other appointee representing the densely populated downstate region besides Christian — said that voting down the transmission projects only cleared the way to approve more fossil fuel use in the state. “We are rightly concerned about the costs of doing things differently, but I believe that we do have an obligation and moral and health obligation to do things differently,” she said. “I’m not comfortable continuing to spend ratepayer money on the same dirty fossil fuel results if there is an alternative before us.” Opponents of the Champlain Hudson line had urged commissioners to approve the Clean Path project but reject the Canadian deal and reopen the bidding process. But a big part of Champlain Hudson’s appeal was that the project already had state and federal permits, and could begin construction in a matter of weeks. If all starts on schedule, the line would start running hydro power into New York City by December 2025, two years earlier than Clean Path and likely several more years before any new proposal. Champlain Hudson also already had contracts in place, meaning it locked in prices from before inflation soared across the world. This means that, in all probability, any alternative would not only come online much later, but cost much more due to increased material prices. Marco Padula, an economist at the state’s Department of Public Services, testified that approving both transmission lines “would be the way to go to maximize the energy benefits for the state.” “We can all be extremely proud today. New Yorkers have chosen Québec’s clean hydropower to supply 20% of the electricity needs of America’s largest city,” Sophie Brochu, chief executive of Hydro-Québec, said in a statement. “This project, a model for an equitable energy transition, is an eloquent example of how we can work together to decarbonize the Northeastern United States.” A handful of Québec’s 55 Indigenous communities, which total some 107,000 people, fiercely opposed Champlain Hudson, arguing that Hydro-Québec’s past seizures of their land were an extension of the attempted genocide of the Americas’ native inhabitants by European settlers. The Hudson Riverkeeper, a New York environmental advocate, echoed their concerns, repeatedly calling the electricity that would flow on the Champlain Hudson “blood energy” from “stolen” lands. The group also cited concerns over what building new dams would do to local ecosystems and food chains, in particular from mercury poisoning that a Harvard University study suggested could come from flooding previously dry forested land. But the city’s contract with Hydro-Québec barred construction of new dams, though some dams already under construction could qualify to sell power on the line. Research commissioned by the company found zero examples of mercury poisoning stemming from its dams. And the company had made deals with several First Nations communities to both co-own a stretch of the Champlain Hudson’s transmission line in Canada and buy additional power from an Indigenous-owned wind farm. “We are rightly concerned about the costs of doing things differently, but I believe that we do have an obligation and moral and health obligation to do things differently.” There were also environmental justice arguments in favor of approving the line. For decades, poor, mostly nonwhite neighborhoods on the western edges of Queens, where much of the city’s gas- and oil-burning power plants are located, have been known as “Asthma Alley,” owing to the high rates of breathing problems there. Costa Constantinides, a former New York City Council member from Astoria who represented those neighborhoods, called the state’s approval of the project “a big win for communities who have for too long had to bear the burden of fossil fuel generation.” “This is a big win for New York City,” Constantinides said after the hearing. “It’s a down payment on the renewable energy future we’ve been promised. We have a lot more to do.” Energy experts overwhelmingly agree that building more transmission lines is vital to decarbonizing the U.S. electricity grid, because renewables like wind and solar are dependent on optimal weather, and urban and industrial centers with the great demand rarely have the space to generate their own electricity. Hydropower, like fossil fuels or nuclear reactors, can run 24/7 and come online quickly when demand spikes, meaning its availability makes it easier for New York to add more intermittent renewable sources without risking blackouts. The state’s legally enshrined climate goals mandate that it generate 70% of its electricity from renewables, including hydropower, by 2030, and eliminate emissions from the power sector entirely by 2040. Reaching that goal, Edwards said, required reinterpreting the commission’s 115-year-old mandate to look solely at the impact to ratepayers from approving new projects and abandon a reliance on the “same old, same old” at a moment when “we’re running out of time.” The lone Black woman on the commission, she poignantly compared the need to “evolve” to meet new challenges of climate change to the way the Civil Rights Act required fundamental changes to how government bureaucrats viewed their mandates to serve citizens. “Just think about what the air quality was and the emissions in 1907,” when the Public Service Commission was established, she said. “Sometimes we have to move past that, just like how the Civil Rights Act evolved. We have to evolve with it,” she added. That meant making tough choices to move the state in the direction it needs to go to slash emissions and local air pollution. “Is it perfect? Absolutely not,” Edwards said. “Do I think that we will get better over time as these projects continue? Yes I do.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Expanding Drought Leaves Western U.S. Scrambling For Water,environment," ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Tumbleweeds drift along the Rio Grande as sand bars within its banks grow wider. Smoke from distant wildfires and dust kicked up by intense spring winds fill the valley, exacerbating the feeling of distress that is beginning to weigh on residents. One of North America’s longest rivers, the Rio Grande is another example of a waterway in the western U.S. that’s tapped out. From the Pacific Northwest to the Colorado River Basin, irrigation districts already are warning farmers to expect less this year despite growing demands fueled by ever-drying conditions. Climate experts say March marked the third straight month of below-average precipitation across the U.S. and areas of record dryness are expanding in the West. On Thursday, federal water managers are scheduled to share their annual operating plan for the Rio Grande, a major water source for millions people and thousands of square miles of farmland in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Mexico. Its outlook is expected to be similarly bleak. Mark Garcia, who farms about 400 acres (160 hectares) with his family in Valencia County, just south of Albuquerque, ran the numbers. He has a degree in mathematics and taught calculus for years before retiring and turning to the farm full time. He found his family would be compensated for not irrigating about half of its acreage this year, and more water would be left in the river to help New Mexico work off a debt that has been growing as the state falls short of its obligations to deliver water to neighboring Texas. “Logically, it was almost like a no-brainer,” Garcia said of opting into the fallowing program. “The risk analysis was, I had to take it, I had to do it. I didn’t want to, though.” Sitting in his backhoe in one of his fields, Garcia began to get emotional. He said he grew up watching his dad farm the land. “I was born into this,” he said. “The hard thing for me is I feel like I don’t want the government to pay for me not to work. I have an issue with that.” The state of New Mexico and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District are hoping more farmers can make that tough choice — at least long enough to help managers address the pending water debt. Even the conservancy district, which oversees irrigation from Cochiti Dam south to Elephant Butte Reservoir, acknowledges it’s a temporary solution. Casey Ish, a water resources specialist with the district, said over 200 irrigators have enrolled, and officials are targeting fields that are less productive or need to be rested. “For us, this is just one tool and one way the district is trying to help the state manage the state’s compact debt, but we certainly don’t anticipate pulling a third or half the district into a fallowing program year over year,” Ish said. “That’s not sustainable from a price point or an ag point.” Thursday’s virtual meeting will include estimates of how much the Bureau of Reclamation will have to work with this season based on spring runoff predictions and current reservoir levels. With below-average snow cover and reservoirs in some places reaching critically low levels, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted in its most recent monthly climate report that concerns are mounting that the western drought will intensify. On the Colorado River, the U.S. Interior Department recently proposed holding back water in Lake Powell to maintain Glen Canyon Dam’s ability to generate electricity amid what it said were the driest conditions in the region in more than 1,200 years. The potential impacts to lower basin states that could see their water supplies reduced — California, Nevada and Arizona — aren’t yet known. But the conundrum speaks to the wide-ranging functions of Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam, and the need to quickly pivot to confront climate change. In the Pacific Northwest, experts are predicting one of the driest summers on record, noting that nearly 71% of the region made up of Oregon, Washington and Idaho is in drought and nearly one-quarter is already experiencing extreme drought. An irrigation district that supplies more than 1,000 farmers and ranchers on the California-Oregon border announced earlier this week that they would get a fraction of their normal water allocation this year due to drought. It’s the third consecutive year that severe drought has impacted farmers, fish and tribes in a region where there’s not enough water to satisfy competing demands. Irrigation districts that supply water to farmers along the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico and along the Pecos in the east also are promising short seasons. Just north of the New Mexico-Colorado border, farmers in the San Luis Valley turned on their spigots April 1, drawing on their share of the Rio Grande. Water managers in New Mexico immediately saw the gauges drop, meaning less water ultimately will make its way to central New Mexico."
13,Ecology Professor Theorizes Loch Ness Monster May Just Be Whale Penis,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost An ecology professor has just come up with a theory about the Loch Ness Monster that is sure to stimulate controversy. Michael Sweet, who is a professor in molecular ecology at the University of Derby, recently suggested on Twitter that “Nessie” isn’t a monster at all, but just a whale penis. Sweet said that many sea monster stories reported by explorers were inspired by what he called “tentacled and alienesque appendages emerging from the water.” But while many of the observers may have believed the appendages breaking the ocean surface might be part of something “more sinister lurking beneath,” Sweet said that in many cases, “it was just whale dicks.” Back in day, travellers/explorers would draw what they saw. This is where many sea monster stories come from ie. tentacled and alienesque appendages emerging from the water - giving belief to something more sinister lurking beneath....however, many cases it was just whale dicks. pic.twitter.com/6ZH1nJZvB1 Whales often mate in groups so while one male is busy with the female the other male just pops his dick out of the water while swimming around waiting his turn. Everyone’s gotta have a bit of fun, right? One female whale is typically paired with a primary escort (male) and a group of males will try to fight for their right to overthrow the escort and earn mating rights. A competition pod can have just a handful of whales or a larger group of 12-15. Sadly, Nessie was unavailable to comment on the whale penis hypothesis, but, to be fair, its just the latest theory to pop up about the probably mythical Scottish creature. Back in 2019, researchers suspected the creature was really a giant eel, while one local man claimed it was just a giant catfish. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,White House Says Story That Bird Pooped On Joe Biden Is Just Crap,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Joe Biden went to Iowa on Tuesday to announce the suspension of a federal rule preventing the sale of higher ethanol blend gasoline , but all anyone is talking about is the supposed bird poop attack. The president was speaking at a manufacturing plant in Menlo when a small white drop fell down on his blue suit jacket just above the pocket. Some people ― especially Republicans ― immediately thought the president was being pooped on. Did a bird just poop on Joe Biden? pic.twitter.com/p2Ywv8CbRU And much like the fly that appeared on Mike Pence’s head during the 2020 vice presidential debate, the possible poop inspired lots of Twitter snark from the GOP and other Biden bashers. Some cultures say when a bird shit's on you it's good luck... well looking at the inflation numbers, Biden needs it https://t.co/ZFK4YX51KZ Apparently birds are also not supportive of Biden's latest gimmick to distract from the damage of his bad policies. https://t.co/SEGAMyxG5P That bird was the American eagle https://t.co/qHMVIEyxnH When even birds know your lies about inflation are full of it https://t.co/tlswphc6BR However, the Des Moines Register said that while there were birds in the giant silo where Biden was speaking, the white substance that fell on Biden’s jacket was actually distillers grain, which it said was a co-product of the ethanol production process. Bloomberg reporter Justin Sink ― who was at the event ― also said the stuff that dropped on Biden was a bit of corn as well. (it was bits of corn flying around from the corn silo; the event was indoors) https://t.co/CZwSJZvf1o The White House naturally said it was the less crappy substance. If you guys knew your way around a corn silo at all, you'd know it was corn. https://t.co/5oaoIjO5Le On Wednesday, “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy had questions about what he called “birdpoopgate” for his son, White House correspondent Peter Doocy. “When the president started off talking about blaming the Putin price hike, a bird pooped on him. At what point did he realize that that had happened?” the elder Doocy asked, according to Mediaite.com . “Hopefully, before he puts that jacket on again,” his son joked.

15,Fast-Moving Wildfire Destroys At Least 150 Structures In New Mexico Town,environment," RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) — A wind-driven wildfire swept through neighborhoods in a mountain community in drought-stricken south-central New Mexico, burning at least 150 structures and forcing the evacuations of schools with 1,700 students, officials said Wednesday. Homes were among the structures that burned on Tuesday but officials did not have a count of how many were destroyed in the blaze that torched at least 6.4 square miles (16.6 square kilometers) of forest, brush and grass on the east side of the community of Ruidoso, said Laura Rabon, spokesperson for the Lincoln National Forest. No deaths or injuries were reported from the fire fanned by winds gusting between 50 mph (80 kph) and 90 mph (155 kph), Rabon said. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Ruidoso’s high school and middle school were evacuated but didn’t burn. Officials in the village declared a state of emergency for the community and said school classes were cancelled Wednesday as the village coped with power outages due to down power lines. The residences that burned were mostly a mix of trailers and single-family homes, and close to 4,000 people were displaced by evacuations. Village spokeswoman Kerry Gladden said authorities were out trying to survey as much damage as possible before Wednesday afternoon, when winds were expected to gust again, raising the fire threat. “Right now, everybody is just rallying around those who had to be evacuated,” Gladden said. “We’re just trying to reach out to make sure everyone has places to stay. Plus in the middle of all this, our village is still without power. Everybody is just trying to get the resources here on the ground where they’re needed and get everyone fed.” Ruidoso in 2012 suffered one of the most destructive wildfires in New Mexico history, when a lightning-sparked blaze destroyed more than 240 homes and burned nearly 70 square miles (181 square kilometers). Rabon said the latest fire continued burning overnight but was less intense. However, no precipitation was in the forecast and humidity levels remained low, Rabon said. “Those extremely dry conditions are not in our favor,” she said. Another wildfire in the Lincoln National Forest northwest of Ruidoso burned at least 400 acres (1.6 square kilometers) after it was sparked Tuesday by power lines downed by high winds, Rabon said. Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell."

0,NYC’s Big Clean-Energy Project Poses A Major Climate Test For The Country,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Last April, New York City marked its 51st Earth Day by suing fossil fuel companies over climate change. A week later, the city started burning even more fossil fuel when its largest source of zero-carbon power, the Indian Point nuclear plant, shut down. The move put New York in league with California, Germany and other places that purport to view global warming and the air pollution from burning oil and gas as urgent crises, but have simultaneously shuttered nuclear facilities, which generate massive amounts of power without carbon emissions. With Indian Point closed, roughly 90% of the city’s grid is powered by fossil fuels. Now, New York faces yet another test of its legally mandated commitment to slash its planet-heating emissions by the end of the decade. On Thursday, state regulators will decide the fate of a long-fought proposal to run a transmission line down the Hudson River from hydropower dams in Québec to the New York City neighborhood of Astoria. The project, called the Champlain Hudson Power Express, would replace half of the capacity lost when Indian Point’s reactors stopped running and provide the kind of fast, reliable electricity that weather-dependent renewables like wind and solar struggle to produce on their own. Unlike other proposals that competed for state approval, the transmission line, known by its acronym CHPE and pronounced “chippy,” has all its state and federal permits and support from the mayor, governor and president. Public comments overwhelmingly favored building the project. And it’s ready to begin construction with union labor in a matter of weeks, with the potential to deliver power as early as 2025. Yet as the state Public Service Commission weighs whether the lucrative contract to build and operate the project is in New Yorkers’ interest, a small but vocal alliance of gas companies, environmental groups and Indigenous tribes has formed to persuade regulators to kill the transmission line. Their reasons for opposing the project range from concerns over the costs to New York ratepayers and competition to New York energy companies, to fears that Hydro-Québec, the government-owned utility behind the project, might prioritize Canadians in a disaster or repeat its ugly history of seizing Indigenous lands in Canada to build more dams and increase its electricity output. “This is an unethical project,” said John Lipscomb, vice president of Hudson Riverkeeper, an influential conservation group that previously supported the proposal. Referring to the hydropower as “blood energy” that would be “stolen” from First Nations tribes, he said, “We talk in New York about how we want to support traditionally marginalized communities, but we find a way to overlook these fatal flaws so we can check a green box.” Instead, groups like Riverkeeper and Sierra Club, along with local gas-burning power generators, want the state to block the Champlain Hudson and kick off a new contest for alternative projects. But such a move would likely delay the delivery of new, clean electricity sources until the end of the decade, and increase costs since the existing Champlain Hudson contracts locked in prices before the current inflation crisis began. On Tuesday night, New York Communities for Change, a progressive climate group, recanted its yearslong opposition to Champlain Hudson and called on the state to approve the line, noting that no other project has any hope of coming online as quickly. “While we respect opponents making good faith arguments against this project, we believe there is simply no time left to waste to bring renewable energy to New York City,” the group said in a statement. “No transmission project is perfect. All have real and painful downsides. Nonetheless, we have decided to support CHPE because it will rapidly reduce New York City’s massive climate impact.” For many who live in western Queens’ power plant corridor, nicknamed “Asthma Alley” over the lasting health effects of smokestack pollution, more time means more breathing problems. “All those environmentalist groups that say we can wait? Let’s find out where they live at,” said Bishop Mitchell Taylor, a preacher and supporter of the project who grew up near the Queensbridge Houses, neighboring one of the city’s biggest and most visible fossil-fueled power plants. “They can wait because they don’t live in Asthma Alley.” The Champlain Hudson would run 339 miles south from Lake Champlain on the Canadian border and follow the water down along the Vermont state line before veering on land to avoid some sensitive aquatic ecosystems. Once it approaches the northern reaches of the Hudson River again, it would dive again back underwater until it reaches the city, at which point it would cut across Randall’s Island and arrive at a converter station in the vast electrical utility park in the northwesternmost corner of Astoria, Queens. Roughly 40% of the line will be on land and nearly all of it will be buried, either underground or beneath river beds. The project will consist of two five-inch, bidirectional high voltage cables that will be able to transmit hydro and wind power down from Canada, and — if a contract is eventually negotiated to do so — send excess wind power from New York’s planned offshore wind farms back up north. First proposed in 2008, the project — a joint venture between Hydro-Québec and Transmission Developers Inc., a company owned by private equity giant Blackstone Group — faced an uphill battle from the start. Building new transmission lines is vital to shifting the U.S. electrical grid away from fossil fuels. Because renewables, which most analysts predict will be the cheapest way to generate electricity in the decades to come, depend on optimal meteorological conditions, a vast network of lines to carry power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed is key to ensuring that taking gas-fired plants offline will not cause blackouts. Eliminating emissions from vehicles and buildings means swapping internal combustion engines for batteries and gas stoves for induction heat. That could increase U.S. demand for electricity nearly 40% by 2050, according to a recent study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “Nobody likes their utility. Nobody likes transmission lines. The benefits of transmission lines are both quite real and very vague — broadly lower energy prices, broadly cleaner energy,” said Liza Reed, a climate policy expert at the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank in Washington, D.C. “All of these are true but hard to see.” Opponents of transmission projects have long held the upper hand in U.S. politics, thanks in part to arcane property rights rules that give landowners ample time and opportunities to challenge construction. Mired in regulatory red tape and political opposition, investors pulled the plug in 2009 on a project to build a 190-mile transmission line from upstate New York to the densely populated Hudson Valley. In 2015, a proposal to build a line from northwestern New York down to the city and its northern suburbs died when the village of Buchanen bought the land on which the developers would have built a substation and sold it instead to a gas company constructing a pipeline. The problem is hardly unique to the Empire State. Journalist Russell Gold’s 2019 book “Superpower: One Man’s Quest to Transform American Energy” chronicled how local opponents and fossil fuel allies in Congress tanked a well-financed effort to construct a transmission line connecting wind turbines in gusty Oklahoma to cities in the southeast. More recently, Maine voters last November approved a referendum blocking construction of a separate Hydro-Québec line that would have carried hydroelectricity from Canada to New England’s gas-dependent grid. The Biden administration, which backs Champlain Hudson and listed it among top priority projects, has taken some steps to make building transmission lines easier. The newly passed bipartisan infrastructure law directs billions to transmission issues and gives the federal government more power to designate a national interest in certain projects and routes to build them, making it easier for developers to overcome opponents. “Fighting climate change means we want to electrify as much as possible, and if we don’t want to also build things like nuclear, we’re going to have to get it from zero-carbon resources that might be where the people are,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert and research associate at the University of Texas at Austin. “Every single credible study that looks at how we get to a zero-carbon economy sees a massive buildout of transmission lines.” Last November, just weeks after Maine’s vote, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) announced finalized contracts with both Hydro-Québec and the developers of a second line, called Clean Path New York, meant to carry wind and solar power produced in New York 175 miles down from a substation in New York’s Delaware County to an electrical facility in western Queens. Clean Path New York, which has yet to receive its permits, would come online at the earliest in 2027, two years after Champlain Hudson. But once completed, the two projects combined would slash the downstate grid’s emissions 51% by the end of this decade. Connecting the northeastern U.S. to Québec’s grid follows a fairly straightforward logic. Look on any given day at the website Electricity Map, which provides real-time views of the carbon-intensity of various grids across the world, and you’ll see a completely green Québec neighboring a New York or New England in shades of yellow that, on some days, verge on orange. Luckily for fossil-fuel addicted Americans, Canadians already export a certain amount of clean electricity over the border. On Tuesday afternoon, the site’s data showed 1.53 gigawatts flowing from Québec into New England and 913 megawatts zapping into New York. To accommodate more renewables, states such as New York, Massachusetts and Maine will need electricity that, like gas or coal, can run 24/7 regardless of weather and come online — or, in energy parlance, be “dispatched” — quickly if demand abruptly spikes. Batteries may, at some point, prove cheap and efficient enough to provide those qualities at scale, but relying entirely on that technology raises questions about how much lithium, nickel and other metals can be mined to meet demand, especially when electric vehicles and cellphones are competing for those same minerals. Technology like carbon capture and sequestration, which catches the CO2 and other pollution generated from burning fossil fuels before it enters the atmosphere, could allow the world to reach its climate goals without sacrificing existing power plants. But it’s so far extremely expensive, and requires, by one estimate, building nearly as many miles of new pipelines to carry captured CO2 as exist in the entire state of Florida. Nuclear plants are by far the most efficient and reliable, and — despite popular misconceptions — among the safest forms of energy production yet harnessed by humans. But they’re also costly and deeply unpopular, particularly after the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan. All that makes hydropower more appealing, at least in places like the Northeast that are forecast to become wetter as the planet warms. “Fossil fuel companies, they don’t fear wind. They don’t fear solar, because they still have a business case,” Sophie Brochu, the chief executive of Hydro-Québec, said in an hourlong sit-down interview with HuffPost at a community center in Astoria last November. “But with this system, which is reliable, clean, and competitive all the time, their business model is eroding.” But hydropower has long been loathed by environmentalists. Building massive dams disrupts ecosystems and requires flooding large areas, which push out species and human communities alike. When forests are flooded, microbes in the soil can convert naturally occurring mercury into methylmercury, which then works its way through the local food chain. The effect, according to a 2016 Harvard University study, is to poison people that eat locally caught food like fish or seal meat. About 90% of proposed new hydroelectric dams in Canada threaten to increase Indigenous First Nations communities’ exposure to methylmercury, the paper concluded, though it is possible to mitigate the damage. “Our research suggests that low impact hydroelectric projects are possible with careful site selection,” Elsie Sunderland, the study’s lead author, said in a press release. “Mitigation measures such as removing topsoil that provides the substrate for methylation in these ecosystems may need to be considered in areas where forecasted exposures are high.” Hydro-Québec’s dams were built largely in the 1940s and 1950s on land seized from the Innu, Atikamekw and Anishinabek First Nations. The simmering conflict came to a head in the 1970s, when the Cree and Inuit peoples protested the construction of new dams and forced the Québec government to the bargaining table. The feud yielded the historic James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement, considered by some to be the first “modern treaty” between aboriginal peoples and the Canadian government. Yet life on the Indigenous lands that surround Hydro-Québec’s dams remains difficult. Median income can be less than half the provincial average, and many still lack sewage systems, running water, and access to the electrical grid, forcing them to rely on noisy and polluting generators despite the neighboring hydro dams, the investigative site New York Focus reported last year. As the company pushed to build its transmission projects in New York and New England, the chiefs of several of those tribes, in a letter co-signed by a handful of Native American tribes, urged the U.S. and Canadian governments to “intervene on our behalf” and force Hydro-Québec and Québec leaders to “sit down with us and negotiate.” “Hydro-Québec claims to offer green energy to American consumers, while making billions of dollars in profits at the expense of the Indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands it exploits,” the letter read. “We are tired of this.” In July, the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke, a First Nations band with a population of nearly 11,000 registered members, made a deal with Hydro-Québec, becoming joint owners of a stretch of the Champlain Hudson transmission line in Canada. In a separate HuffPost interview last November, Kahsennenhawe Sky-Deer, the newly elected grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke, called the deal “unprecedented.” Noting that only a small minority of First Nations in the province challenged the project, she urged Indigenous opponents to set aside historic grievances and embrace industrial projects that promise to cut emissions. “Looking at where our mother is right now, in the grand scheme of global warming, if we don’t start changing the way we’re doing things, we’re all in trouble,” she said. “So it’s not to be looked at now as a racial thing. All the stuff that’s happened in the past, the experience of marginalized people, indigenous people, Black people, Latino people, we have to put all of that behind us and collectively, collaboratively see what we can do differently.” Days later, Hydro-Québec announced a new commitment to work more closely with Québec’s 11 First Nations, which total more than 107,000 people, including donating more money to education programs and hiring more from within the communities. The contract the company negotiated with New York City also stipulates that Hydro-Québec cannot sell electricity from new dams built after the deal was signed. That would still qualify some projects under construction to produce hydroelectricity for New Yorkers, but it also created demand for Hydro-Québec to buy more wind energy to boost the power supply on the line. One of the wind farms is the Apuait, a 240-megawatt project co-owned by Québec Innu communities. Future renewable power lines will also require consulting tribes. That did little to assuage concerns at Riverkeeper, which said those deals don’t offset the damage caused by new dams. It also raised concerns over how species in the Hudson would respond to the electricity, and what kinds of pollutants could be dredged up in the construction process. The group initially supported the Champlain Hudson, which it touted as a way to justify shutting down Indian Point. But after new board members took over the group — and after the nuclear plant closed — Riverkeeper changed its position. “It’s one thing to have a cable running through your land that’s buried. It’s another thing to have dams and reservoirs on your land against your will that flood thousands of square miles of your traditional habitat,” Lipscomb said. “If we were to say to New Yorkers, we’re going to build equivalent sized dams in the Catskills or Adirondacks, there’d be one kind of response versus another response for one buried cable. It’s not comparable.” In Albany’s halls of power, a different story about why to oppose the Champlain Hudson is being told by industry players. For years, the Independent Power Producers of New York, a trade group for the state’s energy utilities, has argued that the transmission line will sap money from the city’s budget and drive up electricity prices upstate. In a white paper, IPPNY said that Hydro-Québec would divert electricity away from lower-cost markets in upstate New York, where it has exported power for over a century, to high-paying customers in New York City, reducing the supply for the northern parts of the state and driving up costs. The state estimated that some upstate ratepayers could see as much as a 10% hike on bills. “Nobody knows what that ratepayer impact is going to be on your bill,” IPPNY CEO Gavin Donohue said. “I don’t know, and I do this for a living.” But Hydro-Québec’s said that double-digit rate increase was cherrypicked from a worse-case scenario state regulators modeled, and argued that analysis fails to consider how much higher rates would be with a delayed, inflation-afflicted alternative. Moreover, the project will be financed in large part through the state Renewable Energy Credit market, with the help of a clause slipped into New York City’s landmark 2019 law requiring big buildings to slash energy use or face fines. The legislation allowed landlords to purchase credits from the hydropower line. The combination of demand for credits and the relatively cheap cost of hydropower could, backers of the project hope, actually bring rates down. And New York City is ready to welcome the project. Mayor Eric Adams, who supports the Hydro-Québec plan, has already budgeted $75 million in 2026 for the project, a spokeswoman said, but noted that the current price estimate may be adjusted over time. Between Champlain Hudson and Clean Path New York, the city expects to pay between $2 billion and $4 billion over the next 25 years — a large number, but still a tiny fraction of what the five boroughs spend on schools and police. “The Champlain Hudson Power Express line and Clean Path New York are vital projects for our city and state. Not only will they help us meet our sustainability goals — they will also be a boon to our recovery, helping to create thousands of good-paying jobs for New Yorkers,” the mayor said in a statement. “Unlocking the potential of the green economy is one of my administration’s key priorities, and we look forward to advancing this project in partnership with local and state officials.” “If we can’t say yes to a project like this, I worry about our ability to hit all of our goals, because we’ve got to be able to make choices like this that put us on the path to clean energy and away from fossil fuels.” Still, upstate companies are frustrated that a converter station in New York that Hydro-Québec included in one of its alternative bids, which would have allowed renewable energy developers in the region to benefit from the transmission line, did not make it into the winning proposal. That wasn’t Hydro-Québec’s choice — state regulators turned down that proposal. But the talking point could still hold sway over the seven-member Public Service Commission, five of whom hail from the northern parts of New York. Only one represents New York City, and another is from Long Island. “We have a lot of companies that I work for that want to do business in New York State, they want New York jobs, they want to pay New York taxes,” Donohue said. “Why aren’t we taking care of in-state resources, in-state jobs, and in-state power? Instead we’re going to Canada.” A better project, he said, would be one that allowed for technologies that existing fossil fuel companies are more amenable to, including carbon capture and hydrogen fuel. But Costa Constantinides, the former New York City Council member from Astoria who spearheaded the 2019 energy-efficiency law, said if the commissioners reject the project over costs, they ought to come explain that to his neighbors, many of whom are “families spending thousands of dollars on asthma medication.” “If you vote no, you better damn well come down to Queens and give us an explanation,” he said. “Don’t you dare hide in Albany behind your bureaucracy. You’re reaffirming the commitment to fossil fuels in New York City if you vote against this project.” The other argument against Champlain Hudson is that the proposed contract only mandates Hydro-Québec to sell the city power during the summer months, when the sweltering heat makes air conditioning necessary and drives up electricity demand. But the city banned gas hookups in new buildings, and Constantinides’ law incentivizes landlords to cut fossil fuel use. As a result, New York City’s electricity demand is set to surge as heat pumps and electric heaters switch on in the winter months from the 2030s onward, according to forecasts from the New York Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s grids. Opponents of Champlain Hudson say even if there is available electricity in those frigid months, it will likely go to Canadian customers, likely enduring even colder temperatures. But Hydro-Québec said it’s too early to tell what that market will look like, or when exactly the city’s demand will start peaking in the winter. But it suggested it would likely continue to sell capacity ― in which the company is paid to keep its generators ready through the winter in case of a surge in demand ― even if it wasn’t contractually obligated to do so, because it will make more money. “This is a portfolio approach but somehow it’s being pitched as are you for hydro or are you for wind. The reality is, we need both,” said Dan Zarrilli, the former New York City mayor’s climate adviser who served in both the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations. “The fact that this project is permitted and ready to go should make this a simple choice for all of us.” He added: “If we can’t say yes to a project like this, I worry about our ability to hit all of our goals, because we’ve got to be able to make choices like this that put us on the path to clean energy and away from fossil fuels.” Leaning back on a bench as a brisk autumn gust blew through the community center in Astoria last November, Brochu cautioned against seeing her company’s project as a panacea to New York’s energy problems. “It’s not perfect, it’s not the only solution, it’s not a miracle, but it’s a real contribution to the hopes, dreams and aspirations of one of the largest metropoles in the world,” she said. “This is a beautiful flower. But it has to be in a beautiful bouquet.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

(AP) — A hungry javelina in Arizona ended up going for a drive when it became trapped inside an empty car and bumped it into neutral. Deputies in Yavapai County responded to a call last week in Cornville, a community 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Sedona, about a javelina stuck in a Subaru station wagon. Javelinas are pig-like animals that are native to desert environments. After speaking with the car’s owner and other residents, they determined the car’s hatch back had been left open overnight. The javelina jumped in to get to a bag of Cheetos. The hatch then closed, trapping the animal inside. Authorities say the javelina ripped off a portion of the dashboard and the inside of a door in an attempt to escape. The animal then managed to knock the car into neutral, causing it to roll down the driveway and across the street. The Subaru came to a rest, and the javelina was not injured. A deputy opened the hatch, and the javelina was able to run back into the wilderness."
3,White House Launches $1 Billion Program To Boost Conservation Goal,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration has launched a $1 billion program to advance its goal of conserving 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030. The program, called the America the Beautiful Challenge, will serve as a “one-stop shop” for states, tribes, territories, non-governmental organizations and others to apply for numerous grants for conservation and restoration projects, the administration said. It is backed by an initial $440 million in federal funds over five years — the bulk of which comes from the bipartisan infrastructure law that Congress passed last year — and aims to draw private and philanthropic contributions to reach the $1 billion mark. Early in his tenure, President Joe Biden set a national goal of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 in order to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. And last May, the administration published a report outlining its vision for a 10-year “locally led” effort to conserve and restore lands and waters, slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and address inequalities in who has access to nature and the outdoors. The new program “will help mobilize new investments in locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration projects across the country, while making it easier for communities to access these resources,” Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said in a statement. Funds will be awarded to projects focused in several areas: conservation and restoration of rivers, coasts, wetlands, forests and grasslands; connecting landscapes and wildlife corridors; increasing resilience to coastal flooding, drought and other climate impacts; and expanding access to the outdoors. The federal investment in the program includes $375 million in ecosystem restoration funds that the Interior Department received via the infrastructure law; $35 million in Forest Service grants for water quality improvement and invasive species prevention; and $25 million in Department of Defense funding to preserve natural resources around military installations. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a private nonprofit that works closely with federal agencies, will oversee the program, and grants will be prioritized for tribal- and Indigenous-led projects. Proposal applications will be accepted from early May to late July, with funding awarded in November. “The America the Beautiful Challenge offers an opportunity to support local efforts led by those who know, love, and have a stake in their surrounding landscapes,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. Monday’s announcement comes as a little-known Texas group ramps up its disinformation campaign against the Biden administration’s initiative, known informally as “30x30.” Since last year, American Stewards of Liberty, a right-wing group with ties to the fossil fuel industry, has been drumming up opposition to the conservation target by falsely characterizing it as a federal “land grab” and stoking fear in rural communities that the administration is readying to seize control of private property. Later this month, the group will host a “Stop 30x30 Summit” summit in Nebraska. The event is being sponsored by several climate denial and anti-federal lands groups, and its keynote speakers include Trump-era Interior secretary David Bernhardt and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). Boebert is among Congress’s most outspoken critics of the initiative. There is nothing to support the conservative narrative about 30x30 being a land grab. In fact, the Biden administration’s report on the program included a commitment to “collaboration, support for voluntary and locally led conservation and honoring of Tribal sovereignty and private property rights.” And while 30x30 had drawn fierce opponents, it remains extremely popular nationwide. A January 2021 survey of registered voters found that 80% support the conservation target. “Protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by the end of the decade can only be accomplished through partnerships and knowledge on the ground in all 50 states,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of conservation group Center for Western Priorities, said in response to Monday’s announcement. “This billion-dollar commitment shows the administration is on the right track to reaching 30x30.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding.

11,Shelter Dog Gets Personal Princess-Themed Tent To Help Him Relax,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A Michigan dog having a tough time at a shelter now has his own private castle ― a pink princess-themed tent. Starsky, a pit bull around age 2, came to I Heart Dogs Rescue and Animal Haven late last year. But he’s been stressed and fearful in the shelter, volunteer Megan Synk told HuffPost. “In his kennel, Starsky is on edge, defensive, and unsure,” she said in an email. “His pupils are dilated, ears pinned forward, furrowed eyebrows, barking, pacing, and toy shredding.” Synk has spent a lot of time with Starsky and knows there’s another side to him. When he’s out of his kennel and with someone who has earned his trust, he’s a “bouncy, affectionate, curious boy” who loves getting scratches on his head and body. Synk had recently learned that hiding spaces can help alleviate stress for shelter animals, since they can block out the goings-on around them and help them feel “protected,” she said. Since dog houses can be pretty expensive, Synk had the idea to try out a kids pop-up tent. Originally, she was going to grab a dinosaur-themed tent for Starsky, but ultimately went with a unicorn one because it was a little cheaper and she “wanted to soften up his bad boy image.” But after Starsky started chewing up the poles on the unicorn tent, Synk had to get a replacement. “I couldn’t find another unicorn pop-up tent, so I went with the next best theme — princess,” she said. Though the tent hasn’t magically transformed Starsky, it’s been a big help to him. “The tent has given him a place to hide in times of stress or anxiety,” Synk said. “Instead of pacing and barking, he has grabbed a nearby toy to take in his tent with him and lay down instead.” After the way the tent helped Starsky ― and the positive response the organization has gotten from the undeniably cute photos ― I Heart Dogs announced this week that it will be collecting new and used kid tents for other animals in the shelter, too. Starsky is generally still “nervous with new people and situations.” To deal with that, he’s been working with a certified trainer and is “doing GREAT,” Synk said. While he completes his training, he isn’t currently listed publicly for adoption, though Synk noted the rescue might consider placing him in a home “if the right people came along to help him.” (Synk and her husband already have multiple dogs of their own, so they aren’t able to adopt Starsky.) The princess tent has brought Starsky a lot of attention, including on social media and via the “Today” show, and Synk is thrilled he has so much support. “We’ve become such good friends and it’s a wonderful feeling seeing others love him as much as I do,” she said. “It means everything to have so many people rooting for him.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
12,How One Diverse Texas Neighborhood Is Fighting Back Against An Unwelcome New Neighbor,environment," Journalist HOUSTON ― The Southwest Crossing subdivision has always been a quiet place, a haven just outside the city’s concrete jungle where the sound of children laughing bounces off neatly paved streets. That was the case until last May, when some residents started receiving letters from CenterPoint Energy that a propane storage facility was moving in next door. Within weeks, residents Eugene Pack and Brittney Stredic could hear construction equipment revving in the distance. At the time, they wondered how the decision was made to build the facility in their section of Fort Bend County ― where, of the more than 800,000 people who live in this area of the city, nearly half identify as nonwhite, according to recent U.S. Census data. The two have since become outspoken community organizers trying to stop the project. CenterPoint Energy started work on its new propane storage facility in August. It is expected to hold 300,000 gallons of the highly flammable gas in four underground tanks the size of small submarines. The company said the project was planned to be completed in March. Stredic told HuffPost in late March that construction of the propane storage facility was still underway. The facility is just 500 feet from homes, and residents worry about its effects on their health, their safety, their property values — their very future in Southwest Crossing. “The level of fear that they’ve placed in this community, it’s insane,” said Pack, 71, a longtime resident and a preacher at Houston’s Praise and Worship Center in the city’s 3rd Ward neighborhood. He and Stredic were standing in a church parking lot next to the CenterPoint construction site, where workers were leaving with their lunches on a rainy day in November. “I don’t know what they were thinking — to put this much of a chemical in a residential neighborhood. This is a dense area.” Energy has been on the minds of Texans since last year’s rare, fatal winter storm Uri caused power outages for nearly 5 million people across the state. Lawmakers and the energy sector have looked at options for reinforcing the state’s energy grid, but despite passage of legislation and new state standards, energy experts say they haven’t taken many steps. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry — which produces natural gas, the energy source perhaps most to blame for the 2021 blackouts after freezing temperatures caused operations to fail during peak usage — has been left alone. Propane, a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas used to heat homes and power appliances, accounted for more than 47% of the state’s electricity generation in 2019. Comparable power sources like coal, nuclear, wind and solar make up a combined 52%, according to state data. Natural gas and propane storage expansion have been underway in Texas for years, promoted as a way to shore up the energy grid. But Southwest Crossing residents worry about the possibility of gas leaks and explosions. They also worry about longer-term effects. Across town, Houston’s 5th Ward, another historically diverse neighborhood, has been dealing with a slowly leaking underground plume containing various chemicals ― including creosote, which preserves wood — from a former rail yard site. The plume is alleged to have created cancer clusters among longtime residents, including in children. “All it takes is one time, one human error,” said Stredic, 27, a lifelong Southwest Crossing resident who has taken time away from her college education to organize against the CenterPoint Energy propane storage site. “People are going to make mistakes. It’s just a matter of, when is that mistake going to happen?” Texas is the top energy-producing state in the U.S., with an energy sector worth an estimated $712 billion. The Lone Star State also consumes more energy than any other state, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But mistakes have become commonplace as the state attempts to reinforce its power grid. In 1989 and 2011, Texans experienced widespread power failures due to extreme winter weather. Both episodes offered warnings for future winter storms, but neither regulators nor utilities took action, setting up the calamity the state saw in 2021. At the height of Uri, natural gas wells and wind turbines froze, and coal, nuclear and gas plants were knocked offline — effectively disabling the bulk of Texas’ power grid. As a result, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the grid, cut power for several days to 2 million homes. Natural gas use spiked as Texans weathered freezing temperatures within their homes, and power plants were unable to restart to meet needs due to extreme weather. It was the largest forced outage in U.S. history. The decision was a last-ditch effort to keep Texas’ energy grid online, and it left Texans scrambling to stay warm. Some burned books and furniture in their homes — with some accidentally burning their homes down in the process. State estimates in the aftermath found that 246 people died in 77 counties. However, other estimates indicate that the final number of casualties from the winter storm was likely much higher. Natural gas utilities, Texas’ majority source of power during winter months, blamed electricity generators for the blackouts. But energy experts say the real problem was that utility companies hadn’t weatherized the grid, which would have required enclosing equipment at power facilities to better protect them from extreme weather. Pressurized dry air is needed to run turbines that then generate electricity for the grid. Importantly, the weatherization precautions keep the dry air dry, as well as operable. Since then, the standards expected of Texas’ power plants have changed. The state’s Public Utility Commission passed new rules, effective as of December, mandating that power plants better winterize their systems, and requiring that operators provide a “notarized attestation” that fixes have been made since the 2021 winter storm. There are also comprehensive, year-round guidelines for weather emergency preparedness and standards. Meanwhile, state lawmakers passed a bill in the most recent legislative session that set new weatherization standards for Texas’ independent energy grid. But while the legislation did create a winter storm emergency alert plan and established the Texas Energy Reliability Council, not included in the bill was funding for necessary weatherization upgrades. The upshot, energy experts say, is that substantive action since the winter storm has been underwhelming. In fact, natural gas facilities, whose failure contributed significantly to the winter storm blackout, have been left alone. Despite pleas from across the political spectrum, upon signing the bill in June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared that “everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid.” Texas has been the only state on its own power grid since 1935, a hawkish means of avoiding federal regulation. However, the state’s independent grid offers a unique opportunity for companies like CenterPoint Energy to capitalize on catastrophic winter storms. As part of an enormous $40 billion spending plan that the Houston-based company announced last September, CenterPoint intends to invest $16 billion in natural gas expansion nationwide over the next 10 years. It has also pledged to lower its emissions to net zero by 2035, an initiative that entails retiring coal units and implementing more solar power technology, according to the company. Included in the plan is increased use of technologies like propane-air peak shaving facilities. The technology, which has been used since at least the 1950s, blends vaporized liquid propane and compressed air to store for use when natural gas supplies are short. The Southwest Crossing project is one such facility. Propane-air peak shaving facilities “are there to be a little bit of a backup,” said Dr. Carey King, an assistant director and research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute. The technology also has the benefit of providing additional backup for the grid when the next storm hits, he noted. “Some places might be better connected or have more than one connection,” King said. “If one power line goes down, there’s another one that’s delivering power to a given area.” CenterPoint Energy built its first propane-air peak shaving facility, the Bluebonnet Point Reserve, in North Houston, another predominantly Black and Hispanic section of the city, in October 2019. The Southwest Crossing facility will be the fourth in the Houston area. “It’s a short distance away. To have two of these types of facilities is a pretty scary thought,” Stredic said. “It’s enough to take out our whole community on this side and that side.” Stredic and Pack have been at the forefront of their community’s effort. They’ve led protests next to the construction site, and they’ve helped keep neighbors informed. They, like other members of their community, want answers from either the city or CenterPoint Energy on why neighborhoods with high shares of people of color were chosen for the facilities. “As you can see, we’re sitting right next to a gas station, and there’s a church, and there’s another gas station,” Stredic said, pointing down the street. “I don’t know if they considered that the lives here needed to be protected.” Historically, industrial sites built near diverse neighborhoods aren’t coincidental, especially in Houston. A 2017 paper by sociologists at Rice University found that the city’s Black children, who are more likely to live in industry-heavy sections of the city, are twice as likely to develop asthma as Houston’s white children. A 2019 paper by the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists also found that 90% of Houston’s Manchester-Harrisburg community — whose residents are 90% Hispanic and 8% Black — lives within three miles of at least one industrial or toxic waste facility. But these trends aren’t unique to Houston. A 2017 report by the Clean Air Task Force and the NAACP concentrated on Black and brown “fence-line” communities ― that is, diverse communities that border oil and natural gas facilities. It found that more than 1 million Black Americans live within half a mile of these types of facilities. In the 91 U.S. counties that have a refinery or a facility that’s currently under construction, those facilities expose as many as 6.7 million Black Americans — 14% of the nation’s total Black population — to toxic and hazardous emissions. “We understand they want to better service this city, especially when we have adverse weather events, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of other people's safety.” About 1 in 5 Black Americans lives near an oil or petroleum refinery, the report found. Southwest Crossing organizers say they don’t want to be the next statistic. “We’re not just an average community. We’re one that goes above and beyond to help each other,” Pack said. They’re looking to preserve Southwest Crossing for their “children, our grandchildren, to be able to live comfortably,” he said. More than anything, community members say they’re confused. Of all the places a facility like CenterPoint Energy’s could be built, why here — why in their backyards? “Historically, these types of facilities are hazardous to the environment and to people,” Stredic said. “We don’t want to accuse CenterPoint of making that type of move, but evidence is not speaking strongly towards that, either ... Until an emergency happens, or something is released in the air, it won’t necessarily be considered a hazard.” Their intention isn’t to hinder infrastructure. “We understand they want to better service this city, especially when we have adverse weather events,” Stredic said. “But it shouldn’t come at the cost of other people’s safety.” It’s unclear what options Southwest Crossing residents have at this point. In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Alejandra Diaz, a spokesperson for CenterPoint Energy, said company officials met with Houston Council Member Martha Castex-Tatum, whose district includes Southwest Crossing, last June. (Castex-Tatum’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.) Several more meetings took place last summer, followed by a three-week voluntary work stoppage at the facility’s construction site while the company responded to community concerns. “Throughout the process, CenterPoint Energy has remained committed to open communications with our customers and community members,” Diaz said. “We appreciate the communities’ support, and respect those who voiced their concerns. We have listened to those concerns and ensured they were addressed.” The Southwest Crossing organizers and their efforts are a version of the classic fight against “unwanted facilities in Black and brown communities,” said Dr. Denae King, a toxicologist at Texas Southern University whose work identifies community environmental health concerns in the region. But she noted that the community’s struggle with CenterPoint Energy is different, in that “by the time they realized, it was already approved; they’d started working on the area.” King worries most about scenarios involving a chain-reaction explosion. “It could be pretty catastrophic,” she said. Her sister-in-law lives in Southwest Crossing. That’s what Southwest Crossing residents have to consider each morning as they awake to the sound of construction equipment revving only about a football field away. There have been upsides, Stredic said. Their community feels more united than ever, bonded over a shared disturbance in the place they call home. “It’s brought a new sense of unity,” she said. There have also been losses. In January, Pack died unexpectedly. “We are still making progress despite our loss,” Stredic said. “Our goal is for them to shut it down and move it away from here.” Journalist"
13,Hundreds Of Thousands Of Puerto Ricans Still Without Power Amid Days-Long Outage,environment," Reporter, HuffPost Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans remained without electricity on Friday after a massive, dayslong power outage on the island. On Wednesday night, a circuit breaker at one of the island’s power plants caught fire, causing an island-wide outage. As of midday Friday, Luma Energy, the private company that is responsible for power transmission and distribution on the island, said that some 600,000 customers had had their power restored. This means that of the total 1.5 million households on the island, some 900,000 remained without power. “This is horrible,” Luisa Rosado, a mother of two who lives in San Juan, told The Associated Press on Thursday. She complained of recent increases in electricity bills, even as outages have been a problem for years. “To increase bills when you don’t provide a perfect service ... the level of impunity is absurd,” she added. The power company said its efforts to restore electricity to more households were expected to carry into the weekend. The outage was one of the largest since Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017, plunging many in the dark for months. Thousands of people died not only during the storm but in the aftermath without power. Even as power company officials in Puerto Rico said FEMA needed to distribute the billions allocated in funding to rebuild the island’s power grid more quickly, FEMA responded by saying Luma needs to provide documentation necessary to begin restoration projects.

14,Republicans Want Oil Execs To Stop Apologizing And Do Less To Avert Climate Disaster,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Executives from six major oil and gas companies testified during a congressional hearing this week as gasoline prices neared record highs and a calamitous report on the urgency of fighting climate change was released. The hearing before a House Committee on Energy and Commerce subcommittee focused on whether the industry is prioritizing profits over increased domestic production, and lawmakers from both parties called on industry executives to get to work and boost output in order to provide relief at the pump. It was also, however, a rare opportunity for lawmakers to press major oil executives on what they are doing to combat climate change, which their industry has played an outsized role in driving. This week, a new United Nations report warned that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than three years from now, then be slashed nearly in half by 2030 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change. But that’s nothing to worry about, according to Republicans. Instead, two GOP members of the oversight and investigation subcommittee urged industry leaders to stop catering to environmentalists and instead double down on the very energy sources that have put the world on a path toward catastrophic and irreversible climatic change. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) noted during the hearing that global energy demand is forecast to increase 50% by 2050 and declared that “renewables will never meet that demand — never.” He then rattled off a list of metals and other resources that would have to be mined and secured to transition from fossil fuels to renewables. And he touted the greenhouse gas emission reductions that could result if all coal-generated power were replaced with natural gas. “That’s the argument you should be making instead of behaving like you have Stockholm syndrome, like your civility to the radical environmentalists in Congress and this administration will one day get them to like you,” Crenshaw told the oil industry executives. “They will never like you.” “Please stand up for your work, your employees and your consumers,” he added. “Speak the truth. Don’t pander to what they want on the left, because Americans need you.” Fact 1: American oil and gas production is cleaner than any other country.Fact 2: Global energy demand WILL increase by 50% by 2050, with most of that coming from oil and gas. Fact 3: Oil and gas contributes to human flourishing. Period. pic.twitter.com/D55eAByskJ Among other things, Crenshaw’s comments ignore the suffering and devastation that climate change-fueled heat waves, drought and extreme weather are already causing around the globe — and that will grow worse with every additional degree of warming. Among the six executives who received Crenshaw’s pep talk were Chevron CEO Michael Wirth and ExxonMobil CEO Darren W. Woods. Chevron and ExxonMobil are both among the top 10 contributors to Crenshaw, donating $29,774 and $23,153, respectively. Crenshaw has received a total of $693,435 in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry over his career, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio), another huge beneficiary of industry campaign cash, gave an equally obsequious lecture, telling the executives they deserve thanks and praise for what they do “to keep the lights on” and “quite literally to fuel modern life as we know it in America.” “But there’s a problem,” Johnson said. “Many of you have big advertising budgets. Why won’t you tell that story? I’m not going to name names, but we’ve all seen the TV commercials from Big Oil, filled with solar panels, green climate messaging about how you’re diversifying your portfolio and how you’re embracing liberal, progressive values.” “What’s been your return on investment with that effort?” Johnson continued. “You’ve taken a shellacking today from the Democrats. Do they seem impressed by your efforts to show your allegiance to their anti-fossil fuel agenda?” Johnson fired off a series of yes-or-no questions about whether the executives are proud of the products and jobs they produce. After getting a series of yes answers, he called on the executives to use his line of questioning as a template for telling their story. He accused the industry of “chasing radical green progressive values.” The oil and gas sector has given Johnson $725,609 over his political career, more than any other industry. 'You’ve taken a shellacking today from the Democrats' — Rep. Bill Johnson gets real worked up on behalf of the fossil fuel industry, asking what’s their ‘return on investment’ for embracing 'radical, green progressive values' pic.twitter.com/xG8UmmtyEn Earlier in the hearing, executives from BP and Shell touted their companies’ investments in renewable energy, including wind and solar, as well as the electrification of the automotive industry. But those investments pale in comparison to the amount of money the industry continues to funnel toward new fossil fuel production and projects. Republican lawmakers’ rhetoric about fossil fuels being superior to renewables — cheaper and more reliable — not only highlights the division in Washington over future energy policy, it also underscores one of the main takeaways from the new U.N. report: that the biggest obstacle to aggressive climate action is not technology or the affordability of renewables; it is political forces. Renewable energy is rapidly getting cheaper and more competitive. From 2010 to 2019, the price of solar energy and lithium-ion batteries fell 85%, while wind dropped 55%, according to the report. But politicians and conservative think tanks repeatedly attack green energy as not yet ready for prime time. A major example of right-wing climate misinformation played out last winter, when a powerful winter storm triggered blackouts across Texas. Crenshaw and Johnson joined a chorus of Republicans who initially blamed the grid outages on the failure of wind turbines and solar panels. “Bottom line: renewables don’t work well in extreme weather. Never will,” Crenshaw tweeted at the time. “Can we ever rely on renewables to power the grid during extreme weather? No, you need gas or nuclear.” In fact, the primary cause of the deadly blackouts wasn’t that renewables didn’t work in the extreme winter weather. It was that instruments froze at coal, nuclear and natural gas power plants. “Let me remind you, people die from lack of energy — and in large numbers,” Crenshaw said at Wednesday’s hearing. “I hope all that green compassion I always hear about has some answers for that.” He voiced no such hope that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would prove more reliable the next time Texas experiences extreme weather.

15,Jena Malone Chases Dog-Beating Suspect And Helps Recover Badly Injured Pooch,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A dog rescued by “Hunger Games” actor Jena Malone while it was being beaten suffered another setback, a friend of the owner said Thursday. “Champ has more issues. he has a fracture in his chest.. they are needing to make sure [he’s] able to have surgery tomorow,” wrote the organizer of a GoFundMe page for the dog. On Twitter Wednesday, Malone, who recently had a recurring role on Amazon’s “Goliath,” recounted her pursuit of a man she saw kicking and choking the leashed dog in Hollywood. Malone first yelled at him from her car to stop, then chased him on foot. She was joined by five men in the pursuit of the man with the battered pup, she wrote. She then returned to her car and drove to where the men surrounded the suspect, who no longer had the dog. A fight had ensued between the man and the rescuers as they attempted to wrest the animal from him, but Malone said she did not see it. Video released by NBC Los Angeles (watch it below) showed the men beating the suspect without the dog as well. Police arrived, Malone said, and after she took possession of the dog she waited for another officer to take the animal to the hospital. “I can’t imagine the level of torture it had suffered to this point,” she wrote. According to NBC Los Angeles, the LAPD arrested the man for suspected animal cruelty but did not charge the group that “attacked the man.” The LAPD did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment. Champ, a small pooch with fluffy white hair, had been missing for five days and has been reunited with owner Kelly McKinney. He was already reported to have broken ribs and a hind leg broken in two places on the GoFundMe page. This was really scary. I saw a man kicking repeatedly a small dog on the sunset, yanking him up in the air and absolutely choking the dog. I yelled at him to stop from my car but he wouldn’t. I got out of my car to try and get the dog but he started running. ( thread) https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap So I started chasing him. I saw other people watching on the street upset , as they must have seen the same abhorrent behavior I witnessed , so I tried to signal a man in an orange vest to run with me to chase him. https://t.co/3ftY194cOx Cause at that point I really didn’t think I was going to be able to get the dog back by myself. After another block of chasing him down I looked back and there were 5 other men behind me pursuing him. Which felt like a miracle. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap So at this point I held back and let them take the lead as I have no business trying to restrain a full grown man.  I went back to get my car( it was still running ) and drove to see if they caught him. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap 6 blocks down from where the chase began a big group had gathered and it look like the man no longer had the dog. So I pulled over to make sure that dog was going to be cared for. I didn’t see the brawl but I was told that the man did not give up the dog without a fight. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap and this is the tail end of a heated fight that ensued. The cops came and took the guy. I waited with dog til another cop came to take them to the hospital. The dog was covered in filth and looked like it had been not taken care of for months https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap After coming out of the hospital , the dog is ok but has a fractured rib , bone breaks in it’s hind legs and another fracture in its right paw. It was absolutely horrific seeing an animal treated this way. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap I’m sorry that it ended in a brawl but the dog was going to die. No question. I can’t imagine the level of torture it had suffered until this point. And now it’s safe in a hospital. Still no word on its owner. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap Also because it important to know , I saw the man get arrested and he wasn’t bleeding and seemed coherent after this filmed altercation. https://t.co/3ftY18M3Ap Update: the dog was chipped and back with his owner.

0,Zoos Hiding Birds As Avian Flu Spreads In North America,environment," OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them. Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care. “It would be extremely devastating,” said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it’s breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. “We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is the utmost importance. There’s a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.” Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out. Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside. So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said. Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas. When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them. Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators. “They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they’re really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we’re not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,” Woodhouse said. Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed. “Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,” said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. “That’s why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.” The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation’s largest —- is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don’t have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary’s senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement. Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he’s heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. “I think our guests understand that we have what’s in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can’t get to see them,” Putney said. Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ___ Associated Press Writers David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa, Lindsay Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City, Julie Watson contributed from San Diego, Chris Grygiel contributed from Seattle and Tom Tait contributed from Las Vegas."
1,Ukraine Zoo Rushes To Evacuate Animals After Heavy Russian Shelling,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A zoo in Kharkiv, Ukraine, is scrambling to evacuate the remainder of its animals after its infrastructure was severely damaged by Russian shelling. Feldman Ecopark “is no more,” founder Alexander Feldman said in a statement on Tuesday after the zoo was “subjected to massive shelling and bombardment” from Russian forces. The statement said the zoo’s “biggest problem” was large predators, such as lions, tigers and bears, which would pose a major danger to humans if they got out of the zoo and roamed free. Feldman said their enclosures were intact but couldn’t withstand more damage. For that reason, if the zoo can’t find a safe location for those animals to go, it may have to euthanize them. “It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,” Feldman said. Feldman Ecopark emphasized in follow-up statements that euthanasia would be a last resort and that it was still attempting to evacuate animals. The logistics of transporting large zoo animals safely is complicated even under normal circumstances. During a war, supply shortages, road damage and the constant risk of shelling make it even harder. Many animals are in an intensely stressed-out state after a month of hearing shelling. Even so, in the last two days, workers have been able to evacuate multiple lions, a jaguar and a panther, the zoo said on social media alongside a video showing lions being transported.

2,Democrats Grill Fossil Fuel Executives About Price-Gouging,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost House Democrats slammed oil and gas industry executives during a hearing on Wednesday, accusing them of profiteering amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the global energy market. The consensus among committee Democrats and Republicans, as well as the executives who testified, is that the U.S. needs to boost domestic production in the short term in order to provide Americans relief at the pump. Where they fiercely disagree is on the barriers keeping that from happening. Rep. ​​Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, displayed a chart showing that while the price of crude oil has dropped in recent weeks, gasoline prices in the U.S. remain near historic highs. “Why?” she asked. “If the price of gas is driven by the global market, why is the price of oil coming down but the price at the pump is still at record highs?” “Something just doesn’t add up,” she added. Industry executives from Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron, Shell USA, Devon Energy Corp and Pioneer Resources said the global market controls prices, not individual companies, but struggled to explain the widening gap. “Changes in the price of crude oil do not always result in immediate changes at the pump,” said Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron. He added that “it frequently takes more time for competition among retail stations to bring prices back down.” “It is a very complex set of factors that impact the price of gasoline,” including supply risk across all fossil fuel products, said David Lawler, president of BP America. Rep. Diana DeGette asks BP exec David Lawler why ‘gas prices [are] so high even after crude oil prices came down’ — here’s how he responded pic.twitter.com/aQ4V7N4Urh Republicans on the committee ran to the industry’s defense. Reps. Morgan Griffith (Va.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) argued that the Biden administration’s “anti-American energy agenda” and “war” on fossil fuels are to blame for inflated prices. “It is impossible to generate confidence or invest in production today when future production is clearly being blocked by this administration,” Griffith said. Griffith asked each of the executives if their company was “taking advantage of the crisis in Ukraine to keep prices artificially high in order to increase your own profits?” All of them said they were not. “We have no tolerance for price-gouging,” Wirth, of Chevron, said in his opening remarks. But as DeGette and other Democrats on the panel pointed out, and as the executives acknowledged, the industry is raking in record profits. The six companies present Wednesday brought in a combined $75 billion in profits last year. And when the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas surveyed 139 industry executives last month, the majority — 59% — cited investor pressure as the main reason producers have not ramped up production. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the industry is “ripping off the American people.” “At a time of record profits, big oil is refusing to increase production to provide the American people some much-needed relief at the gas pump. Instead, they are buying back their stock at an estimated $40 billion this year. Big oil is lining their pockets with one hand and taking millions in taxpayer subsidies with the other.” Stock buybacks are when a company uses its profits to buy up its own stock, often leading to a surge in the stock price. Pallone asked each of the executives if they would commit to reducing stock buybacks and dividends for shareholders, which would enable them to increase production instead amid ongoing turmoil in the energy market. None of them said they would. “I can’t commit to a reduction in buybacks,” Lawler said. Rep. @FrankPallone asks oil company executives: ""Will you commit to doing whatever it takes, including increasing production, but also reducing dividends and buybacks, in order to lower prices for struggling American consumers? Yes or no?"" pic.twitter.com/LgxCjVfHdb Monday’s hearing and U.S. lawmakers’ push for more fossil fuel development come against the backdrop of a new United Nations report that warns global carbon emissions need to peak by 2025, then go down 43% by 2030, in order to prevent catastrophic planetary warming. Last week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year. He also called on Congress to pass “use it or lose it” legislation requiring oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases. Highlighting the tightrope that Democrats are walking on energy ahead of the midterms later this year, when gas prices are likely to be high on voters’ minds, Pallone called on industry executives to “take some action to reduce the pain at the gas pump.” “Produce more oil,” he said on Wednesday. “Produce more with the wells you have.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Wind Energy Company Pleads Guilty To Killing 150 Eagles,environment," BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A wind energy company was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after at least 150 eagles were killed over the past decade at its wind farms in eight states, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. NextEra Energy subsidiary ESI Energy pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act during a Tuesday court appearance in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was charged in the deaths of eagles at three of its wind farms in Wyoming and New Mexico. In addition to those deaths, golden and bald eagles were killed at wind farms affiliated with ESI and NextEra since 2012 in eight states, prosecutors said: Wyoming, California, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois. The birds are killed when they fly into the blades of wind turbines. Some ESI turbines killed multiple eagles, prosecutors said. It’s illegal to kill or harm eagles under federal law. The bald eagle — the U.S. national symbol — was removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2007, following a dramatic recovery from its widespread decimation due to harmful pesticides and other problems. Golden eagles have not fared as well, with populations considered stable but under pressure including from wind farms, collisions with vehicles, illegal shootings and poisoning from lead ammunition. The case comes amid a push by President Joe Biden for more renewable energy from wind, solar and other sources to help reduce climate changing emissions. It also follows a renewed commitment by federal wildlife officials under Biden to enforce protections for eagles and other birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, after criminal prosecutions were halted under former President Donald Trump. Companies historically have been able to avoid prosecution if they take steps to avoid bird deaths and seek permits for those that occur. ESI did not seek such a permit, authorities said. The company was warned prior to building the wind farms in New Mexico and Wyoming that they would kill birds, but it proceeded anyway and at times ignored advice from federal wildlife officials about how to minimize the deaths, according to court documents. “For more than a decade, ESI has violated (wildlife) laws, taking eagles without obtaining or even seeking the necessary permit,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement. ESI agreed under a plea agreement to spend up to $27 million during its five-year probationary period on measures to prevent future eagle deaths. That includes shutting down turbines at times when eagles are more likely to be present. Despite those measures, wildlife officials anticipate that some eagles still could die. When that happens, the company will pay $29,623 per dead eagle, under the agreement. NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said collisions of birds with wind turbines are unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized. She said the company is committed to reducing damage to wildlife from its projects. “We disagree with the government’s underlying enforcement activity,” Kujawa said in a statement. “Building any structure, driving any vehicle, or flying any airplane carries with it a possibility that accidental eagle and other bird collisions may occur.”"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

11,Fox Tests Positive For Rabies After Biting Multiple People On Capitol Hill,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A female fox that was captured and killed after biting multiple people on Capitol Hill has posthumously tested positive for rabies. “The DC Public Health lab has confirmed the fox that was captured yesterday tested positive for the rabies virus,” the D.C. Department of Health said in a statement sent to HuffPost, adding that it will contact anyone who reported a bite. The fox was “responsible for 9 confirmed bites on Capitol Hill” and was “humanely euthanized” to be tested for rabies, the department said in an earlier statement on Wednesday. Because a rabies test involves brain tissue, it can’t be conducted on a living animal. Foxes are known carriers of rabies, and D.C. law states that wild animals that cause a potential rabies exposure in a person or another animal must be killed so they can be tested for the deadly virus. Three fox kits were also found and captured. Officials determined they needed to be euthanized as well, because of the likelihood that they also had rabies. “Since the mother tested positive for the rabies virus and the kits could have been exposed during grooming or other means, they were no longer able to be safely rehabilitated and were humanely euthanized,” the health department said Thursday. Animal control officers caught the mother fox on Tuesday after multiple reports of bites, including an “unprovoked” one on Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.). Shortly afterward, Bera began receiving a course of the post-exposure rabies vaccine. Anyone who has had a potential rabies exposure should seek medical help immediately, and will almost certainly need to begin a post-exposure vaccine regimen. The vaccine prevents people from actually developing rabies. However, if a person does not get the vaccine and begins developing rabies symptoms, the disease is almost always fatal. Only a tiny number of people have ever survived rabies, and they did so after undergoing an intensive procedure involving an induced coma. DC Health urged anyone who had contact with the fox to call the department at 202-442-9143. This story has been updated throughout. Assignment editor, HuffPost"

The announcement came hours after the department tweeted it had “received several reports of aggressive fox encounters on or near the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.” #BREAKING: Captured. pic.twitter.com/LJAn2ZjH9J One of the people bitten was Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), who told Heather Caygle of Punchbowl News that the attack was “unprovoked” and the fox lunged at the back of his leg. Rep.

But if the captured fox is the right one, it’s not exactly clear what will happen. U.S. Capitol police said in its tweet that that animal control officers “are working to trap and relocate any foxes they find.” When reached by HuffPost, a police spokesperson said the fox’s fate is a question for animal control. When asked whether killing the fox was on the table, Miller referred HuffPost to D.C. regulations on wildlife bites. The law states that “wildlife that has bitten a person or animal, or caused a potential rabies exposure to a person or animal” must be euthanized immediately for rabies testing. (Because rabies testing involves brain tissue, it cannot be performed on a living animal.) The D.C. Department of Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment from HuffPost. The captured fox was female, Miller said, and animal control officers are working to find out if she had any kits in the area. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Capitol Police captured the fox. While Capitol Police tweeted about the incident, animal control officers were the ones to capture her.

13,99% Of World’s Population Breathes Poor-Quality Air: WHO,environment," GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. health agency says nearly everybody in the world breathes air that doesn’t meet its standards for air quality, calling for more action to reduce fossil-fuel use, which generates pollutants that cause respiratory and blood-flow problems and lead to millions of preventable deaths each year. The World Health Organization, about six months after tightening its guidelines on air quality, on Monday issued an update to its database on air quality that draws on information from a growing number of cities, towns and villages across the globe — now over 6,000 municipalities. WHO said 99% of the global population breathes air that exceeds its air-quality limits and is often rife with particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the veins and arteries and cause disease. Air quality is poorest in WHO’s eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia regions, followed by Africa, it said. “After surviving a pandemic, it is unacceptable to still have 7 million preventable deaths and countless preventable lost years of good health due to air pollution,” said Dr. Maria Neira, head of WHO’s department of environment, climate change and health. “Yet too many investments are still being sunk into a polluted environment rather than in clean, healthy air.” The database, which has traditionally considered two types of particulate matter known as PM2.5 and PM10, for the first time has included ground measurements of nitrogen dioxide. The last version of the database was issued in 2018. Nitrogen dioxide originates mainly from human-generated burning of fuel, such as through automobile traffic, and is most common in urban areas. Exposure can bring respiratory disease like asthma and symptoms like coughing, wheezing and difficulty in breathing, and more hospital and emergency-room admissions, WHO said. The highest concentrations were found in the eastern Mediterranean region. On Monday, the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus suffered through high concentrations of atmospheric dust for the third straight day, with some cities experiencing three and nearly four times the 50 micrograms per square meter that authorities consider normal. Officials said the microscopic particles could be especially harmful to young children, the elderly and the ill. Particulate matter has many sources, such as transportation, power plants, agriculture, the burning of waste and industry – as well as from natural sources like desert dust. The developing world is particularly hard hit: India had high levels of PM10, while China showed high levels of PM2.5, the database showed. “Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, is capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and entering the bloodstream, causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts,” WHO said. “There is emerging evidence that particulate matter impacts other organs and causes other diseases as well.” The findings highlight the sheer scale of the changes needed to combat air pollution, said Anumita Roychowdhury, an air pollution expert at Center for Science and Environment, a research organization in New Delhi. India and the world need to brace for major changes to try to curb air pollution, including using electric vehicles, shifting away from fossil fuels, embracing a massive scaling-up of green energy and separating out types of waste, she said. The Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that more than 60% of India’s PM2.5 loads are from households and industries. Tanushree Ganguly, who heads the council’s program on air quality, called for action toward reducing emissions from industries, automobiles, biomass burning and domestic energy. “We need to prioritize clean energy access for households that need it the most, and take active measures to clean up our industrial sector,” she said. ___ Follow all AP stories on climate change issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate. ___ Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi contributed to this report."
14,‘Now Or Never’: New U.N. Report Sees Narrow Path For Averting Climate Catastrophe,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost For the world to have any chance of preventing catastrophic climate change, it needs an immediate, collective and herculean effort to phase out fossil fuels and rein in greenhouse gas emissions. And even if humanity pulls it off, planetary warming is likely to at least temporarily soar past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the aspirational goal of the landmark Paris climate accords. That is the conclusion of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report, published Monday, focusing on what is required to tackle a threat that is already causing suffering and devastation around the globe. Although there are signs of climate action, the world remains wildly short of meeting international goals. “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C,” Jim Skea, who co-chairs the panel that authored the report, said in a statement. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” To achieve the 1.5-degree target, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 and then be cut approximately 43% below 2019 levels by the end of the decade, and 84% by 2050, the IPCC said. That is a monumental task. Human greenhouse gas emissions were 12% higher in 2019 than in 2010, and policies implemented at the end of 2020 have put the planet on course to a devastating 3.2 degrees of warming. Existing and soon-to-be-built fossil fuel infrastructure are forecast to spew enough pollution into the atmosphere in the coming years to put the 1.5-degree target out of reach. “Increased action must begin this year, not next year; this month, not next month; and indeed today, not tomorrow,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. environment program, said at a news conference announcing the findings. “Otherwise we will ... continue to sleepwalk into a climate catastrophe.” As the report highlights, the solution is clear: The world, in particular wealthy nations that are responsible for the vast majority of emissions, must stop investing in dirty energy and move quickly to replace coal, oil and gas with renewables, like solar and wind. Political forces continue to be the biggest obstacles to aggressive action. “The interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action,” reads a technical document accompanying the report. The sobering assessment comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens to further delay efforts to confront climate change in the U.S. and abroad. The Biden administration has set ambitious climate goals, but is now facing pressure to boost domestic oil and gas production in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they scramble to reduce their reliance on Russian petroleum. António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, recently warned that the conflict in Eastern Europe could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees. And at Monday’s news conference, he said the report is “a litany of broken promises” and “a file of shame.” “Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals,” Guterres said. “But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” Monday’s report, authored by 278 experts from 65 countries, is the third installment of the IPCC’s sixth global assessment. The second report, published in February, analyzed climate impacts and vulnerabilities, and warned that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than previously known. The window to “secure a livable and sustainable future for all” is rapidly closing, that document said. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development and a peer-reviewer of the new report, said the world is facing a “do-or-die moment.” “If the last report from the Sixth Assessment was an atlas of human suffering and failed leadership, this report is an atlas of human hope and the last chance for the leadership we need from the heads of State to return to a safe climate,” Zaelke said in a statement. John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, said the report “represents a defining moment for our planet.” “Every country must move further and faster,” Kerry said in a statement. “Faster means rapidly upscaling deployment of renewable energy. Faster means targeting methane emissions. Faster means reducing demand and focusing on efficiency. Faster means halting and reversing global deforestation. Faster means demanding more sustainable transit.” “Choosing the more sustainable option is not only the right thing to do, but the IPCC has shown it is now the more affordable choice,” Kerry added.

15,Russia Crisis Should 'Supercharge' Climate Efforts In Build Back Better 2.0: Memo,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A progressive climate group is looking to thrust Russia’s war and its impact on the global energy market to the center of any revived talks on President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, lobbying for the inclusion of more than a dozen investments to boost clean energy and reduce U.S. reliance on oil and gas. After killing the original version of the massive climate and social spending package last year, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) recently signaled his willingness to come to the table on a pared-down version, as long as it specifically focuses on climate change, prescription drug prices and cutting the federal deficit. The $1.7 trillion reconciliation package that House Democrats passed in November included approximately $555 billion in total climate spending. In a memo shared with HuffPost and set to be distributed to officials on Capitol Hill and in the White House, climate advocacy group Evergreen Action outlined 15 specific climate investments that were part of the House-approved bill that it hopes to see prioritized in any resurrected version. The group says those provisions would go a long way toward speeding up the transition to renewable energies and breaking free of a global oil and gas market that is empowering Russian President Vladimir Putin and other bad actors. “We want to connect the dots here, to galvanize more support for Congress to take the action that they need to actually solve this problem,” Lena Moffitt, the group’s chief of staff, told HuffPost. “The war in Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding and has captured everyone’s attention, and is also spotlighting one more reason why we need to get off of fossil fuels.” “It just so happens that Congress is considering a bill that would supercharge our ability to do so,” Moffitt added. While Evergreen Action supports the full suite of climate provisions in the now-stalled Build Back Better Act, its memo spotlights those that would have the most immediate impact on reducing U.S. demand for oil and gas. They include tax credits on everything from electric vehicles and solar panel manufacturing to energy efficient buildings and green hydrogen production; huge investments to decarbonize the industrial, building and manufacturing sectors and electrify the fleet of federal vehicles; and $29 billion for a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to jump-start the deployment of clean energy infrastructure. The memo cites a recent survey from think tank Data for Progress that found over two-thirds of all likely voters support federal investments to advance clean energy in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also cites a study from policy firm Energy Innovation that concluded the climate provisions in Biden’s Build Back Better would reduce U.S. oil consumption enough by 2027 to offset the amount of Russian oil imported into the U.S. last year. “The takeaway is clear: passing bold investments in electrification and clean energy offers the best pathway to cut U.S. demand for fossil fuels, protect American families’ bottom lines, and end our dependence on authoritarian petrostates,” the Evergreen memo reads. Last month, Evergreen took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), releasing a video demanding that he deliver on his promise to “forcefully, insistently and urgently” address climate change via a climate spending bill. The group doubled down on that pressure in Monday’s memo, writing, “President Biden and Majority Leader Schumer must get a deal done, and get the climate provisions of the House-passed reconciliation bill through now.” Dozens of House Democrats sent Biden a letter in mid-March calling on him to restart reconciliation negotiations, with climate as his primary goal. Reconciliation is a special budget process that only requires 51 votes to make it through the Senate. Biden has faced enormous pressure from both sides of the aisle in recent weeks. Republicans are demanding that he “unleash” U.S. oil and gas production to combat rising energy costs and help European allies reduce reliance on Russian oil, while Democrats are largely calling on him to move even more quickly toward renewable sources of energy. Last week, Biden ordered a massive release from the nation’s strategic oil reserves — up to 1 million barrels per day for the next six months — to provide relief from high gas prices, but stressed that the ongoing crisis highlights the urgent need for the kind of climate and clean energy investments in his stalled plan. “Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether,” Biden said. “We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability. We need to double down on our commitment to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis with our partners and allies around the world.” “We need to embrace all the tools and technologies that could help us free us from our dependence on fossil fuels.” Read the memo below: Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

0,Inside The Contentious Leadership Battle At The Nation’s Biggest Environmental Group,environment," On Assignment for HuffPost The intense internal conflicts that have roiled the Sierra Club for the better part of a year will come to a head April 27, when the organization’s roughly 780,000 members finish voting for five candidates to sit on its 15-person board. The election features a group of insurgent petition candidates vying against a slate the majority of the current board supports in a fight over the future of America’s most iconic environmental organization. The four petition candidates, who had to gather signatures to get on the ballot, are running on a platform to “save the Sierra Club” from a board that they contend has engaged in “top-down,” “ideologically-driven” governance, while “censoring and silencing” the club’s grassroots volunteers. Six board-backed candidates, running as the “Forward Sierra” slate, say that their opponents are intent on reversing or slowing “many of the critical efforts underway to make us a stronger, more unified and more inclusive organization.” Both sides describe the election as the most important in years. The vote comes in the wake of a series of controversies over race and identity, workplace culture, organizational structure and the legacy of the organization’s founder, John Muir, a longtime symbol of the environmental movement. In the summer of 2020, then-Executive Director Michael Brune published a statement on the Sierra Club website that effectively portrayed Muir as a racist, titling the piece “Pulling Down Our Monuments” and apologizing for what he described as the club’s “substantial role in perpetuating white supremacy.” The piece kicked off internal conflict that burst into public view in 2021, when three prominent leaders — Aaron Mair, the club’s first African American president; Mary Ann Nelson, the first African American elected to the club’s national board; and Chad Hanson, a well-known forest ecologist and activist — published a lengthy defense of Muir’s record and reputation. “It’s important to think critically about our movement’s historical figures, John Muir included,” the trio wrote. “However, some recent articles by environmentalists and environmental writers — though perhaps guided by good intentions, and well-written and researched in other respects — contain some inaccurate and unfounded information that could create damaging divisions among the conservation movement and environmental justice advocates.” The group had initially sought to publish its defense in the Sierra Club’s magazine, but the board voted to prohibit them from doing so. They then turned to the Earth Island Journal, which published their piece in August 2021. The trio also spoke to Politico about their views. They were ultimately punished in November 2021 when the board majority passed a pair of “accountability resolutions” that officially admonished Mair and Hanson, who were, and still are, board members and accused them of causing “significant and ongoing harm” to the club. The board majority subsequently declined to back Mair in his reelection bid this year. Hanson is not yet up for reelection. The spectacle of the club’s first African American president and others being censored and admonished for publicly defending Muir did not sit well with some members ― and it helped give rise to the petition slate that is challenging the current board leadership. Among them was Michael Dorsey, an environmental scientist who previously served for 11 years on the Sierra Club’s national board and who has now joined Mair as one of the four insurgent candidates. “We don’t have time for that kind of stuff,” said Dorsey, given the pressing need to fight the climate crisis and to tackle environmental injustice. The club, Dorsey said, needs “a course correction at the top.” Dorsey and Mair are running on the petition slate alongside Kathryn Bartholomew, a grassroots volunteer leader from New York, and Maya Khosla, a wildlife biologist, writer and forest activist from California. Another prominent club member incensed by the Muir incident: the bestselling science-fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson. “I was amazed that the Sierra Club Board of Directors had been so foolish as to try to censor their own people who sought to make a statement in defense of their founder,” Robinson told HuffPost. “It challenged my sense of what this group’s intelligence and motivations actually were.” “Really, I think the whole board of directors ought to resign after what they did in response to the essay by Mair, Hanson and Nelson,” he added. “They ought to say, ‘Oops, collective moment of insanity. We ruined the reputation of the club, and we are going to resign now and let a new group take over.’” Robinson, whose forthcoming book involved deep research into Muir, helped gather signatures to get the petition candidates on the ballot. The Muir controversy, though, is not the only issue in this election fight. Around the same time that Mair and his co-authors published their article, both The Intercept and Politico published the executive summary of an internal Sierra Club report that described “a culture at the Sierra Club that tolerated, excused, or failed to correct those managers and leaders who regularly displayed anger and aggression — yelling, berating, shaming, and otherwise demonstrating unprofessional and abusive behavior in the workplace.” The report emphasized the club’s need to do more to fulfill its professed “commitment to equity and inclusion” and to address “culture concerns.” Ramona Strategies, an outside consulting firm that declined to comment for this article, authored the report. In order to further the “cultural transformation underway” at the Sierra Club, the consultants made several recommendations to leadership. Perhaps the most controversial was their “strong recommendation” that the organization “no longer delegate [managerial authority] to volunteers; all employees should be managed by and subject to the oversight of individuals also under the organization’s clear control and direction as employees.” This issue, more than anything, seems to be at the center of the current board election. The board-backed candidates say on their website that they are “deeply committed to our mission and to creating an inclusive environment for volunteers and staff.” “We need to make sure the Club is reaching everyone and feels welcome for people of all backgrounds,” Brian Gómez, a sitting national board member who is running for reelection on the board-backed slate, said in a written statement. Mair said the petition slate agrees that inclusiveness at the club is paramount and that any harassment, bullying or other inappropriate behavior must be taken seriously and remedied. But Mair and his allies oppose what they believe is a board and staff effort to strip authority from the club’s thousands of grassroots volunteers, including scores of volunteer-controlled state chapters that have historically operated semi-autonomously. State chapters can elect their own leaders, hire their own staff and set their own priorities. “This is not a disagreement over whether racism and sexism and harassment should be punished and dealt with,” Mair told HuffPost. “It is a disagreement over the management authority and due process rights of grassroots volunteers .… It is an attack on their rights to lead and run the local organizations that they have created.” “First they canceled Muir,” he said, “now they want to cancel the power of the volunteers.” As an example, he pointed to a resolution the board majority passed last year that initiated a “multi-year transition” that he believes will remove the primacy of state chapter volunteer leadership in managing their chapter staff, a longstanding Sierra Club tradition. The new “co-lead” model described in the resolution will give national staff more power over chapter personnel and priorities, Mair said. He also pointed to sweeping punitive actions the national organization has taken in recent months against grassroots volunteers, including its moves to suspend or threaten suspension of entire elected state chapter governing bodies in places like Colorado and Oregon. In the Colorado case, the board has accused the chapter’s governing body of a “harmful and non-inclusive” management culture, among other allegations, according to a letter HuffPost obtained. One longtime Colorado chapter member and leader, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, pushed back on those allegations, calling them unsubstantiated. She thinks the national organization’s threat to suspend Colorado’s volunteer leadership is based primarily on policy disagreements. “Historically, the Sierra Club has been a volunteer-run organization, and staff take their direction from volunteers as far as what is prioritized in conservation campaigns. That has been a historical model,” she said. “I think that is a model they want to change, and the easiest way is to get rid of volunteer leadership that doesn’t agree with that.” Marcia Hanscom, a former national board member and current volunteer leader in the club’s Angeles Chapter in Southern California, said such issues of organizational structure and governance are at the heart of this election. “A lot of folks are very upset that we are going to lose our democratic organization,” she said. “People feel the grassroots leadership is at serious risk.” Some of the largest Sierra Club chapters in the country, including the Angeles Chapter, the Atlantic Chapter in New York state, the Colorado Chapter, the New Jersey Chapter and the Pennsylvania Chapter, have endorsed all or a majority of the petition slate. The national board majority, led by President Ramón Cruz, has endorsed Gómez as well as the other five members of the “Forward Sierra” slate, including Cheyenne Skye Branscum, a member from Oklahoma, Cynthia Hoyle, a member from Illinois, and Shruti Bhatnagar, a volunteer leader from Maryland. When asked by HuffPost about the autonomy and authority of state chapter governing bodies, Hervé Jean-Baptiste, another board-backed candidate, said in an email that he supports “initiatives that empower chapters to build and invest in grassroots power. The club’s commitment to this has not wavered.” Allison Chin, another member of the board-backed slate, echoed his perspective, saying that she supports “investments that build chapter capacity and grassroots empowerment.” Among other endorsements, the board-backed slate also has the support of the Progressive Workers Union, which represents about 400 Sierra Club staffers. The union had denounced Mair and Hanson for their statements about John Muir last year. Ramón Cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The club’s national communications office had not provided comment at the time of publication. Representatives of the Progressive Workers Union also did not provide on-the-record comment for this article.  A memo from the club’s national communications office circulated among board members and volunteer leaders on an open listserv late last year ― which HuffPost has reviewed ― instructed them not to respond to inquiries from this reporter and others looking into the organization’s internal affairs. All four petition candidates, some of them fearful of being sanctioned for speaking to the press, made clear that statements provided for this article represented their personal opinions, not the views or policies of the Sierra Club itself. Despite their differences, all sides seemed to agree on at least one thing: The country needs a strong and committed Sierra Club if it is to tackle the climate and extinction crises.

1,Maine Farmers Ship Millions Of Pounds Of Potatoes West To Help After Drought,environment," PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine’s potato growers had such a bumper crop this past season that they stepped in to help their big brothers out west who were short on spuds. Farmers from Maine shipped potatoes by rail for the first time in four decades this winter thanks to a strong harvest in the state and heat and dry weather that stymied farmers in renowned potato-growing states like Idaho and Washington. The potatoes made their way more than 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) for processing, riding in climate-controlled rail cars. All told, 21 million pounds (9.5 million kilograms) of potatoes, virtually all from growers in northern Maine, flowed through a rail-connected warehouse owned by LaJoie Growers LLC. That equates to more than 530 truckloads of potatoes, said co-owner Jay LaJoie. “It’s a good chunk of potatoes,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board. Most of the Maine potatoes went to processors in Washington state, where much of the french fries and other products are exported. The shipments to Idaho were seed potatoes, including Maine’s Caribou russet, that’ll be planted this spring. Chris Voigt from the Washington State Potato Commission said processors were grateful for the potato shipments, but they’re hopeful Maine growers’ services aren’t required in the future. The shipments came to an early end about two weeks ago, party because of economic disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine. But it was good while it lasted, helping out potato processors in western states while reducing an oversupply of Maine spuds. It also proved the value of rail lines for agriculture, especially during a shortage of trucks in the pandemic, LaJoie said. There’s no way growers could have sourced enough tractor-trailers to haul the potatoes, but there happened to be an available rail line that connects to a LaJoie-owned warehouse in Van Buren. The shortage of truck drivers has contributed to supply-chain problems during the pandemic. “I don’t see transportation getting better anytime soon,” LaJoie said. While Maine is known for its famous lobsters, the state was indeed once the nation’s potato capital through World War II. Other states later stepped up production in the 1950s. Idaho and Washington State are currently Nos. 1 and 2 while Maine ranks ninth, according to the USDA. The unusual shortage of potatoes out west is a result of weird summer weather. A heat wave with temperatures soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) hit the Pacific Northwest in June, just as potatoes were starting to grow. The result was reduced yields, and lower quality, Voigt said. “The plants sort of shut down,” he said. The extreme heat reduced yields by nearly 10% for potato growers in Idaho and Washington, while Maine potato yields grew more than 30% thanks to good weather, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In northern Maine, the harvest was so big that growers scrambled to find storage. Some buildings at the former Loring Air Force Base were enlisted for a last-minute home for the abundant tubers. In the end, it proved to be a successful pilot program for rail delivery that could be used again if unusual weather patterns persist, LaJoie said. Plus Maine enjoyed getting some attention for its potato industry thanks to the irony of David rendering aid to the potato Goliaths."
2,More Than 5 Million Chickens In Iowa Slated To Be Killed Over Bird Flu,environment," DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bird flu has infected two more farms in Iowa, forcing the killing of 5.3 million hens and 88,000 turkeys, officials said Friday. The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million egg-laying chickens, 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys. Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill more than 18 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually. The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa. Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County. Because  the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they are infected. USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 26 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products. Cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F kills bacteria and viruses."
3,Biden’s Ambitious Global Climate Agenda Is In Peril. Can He Save It?,environment," Reporter, HuffPost Environment Reporter, HuffPost Last April, President Joe Biden convened dozens of world leaders for a “virtual climate summit” that sought to generate more ambitious environmental policies ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference later in the year. The summit, held on an occasionally glitchy Zoom call, sought to prove that Biden would restore the climate credibility the U.S. had lost under President Donald Trump, and make it a leader in the global fight against catastrophic planetary warming. Biden has made a series of moves meant to bolster that aim. He returned the U.S. to the 2015 Paris climate accords, pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half before 2030 and to net-zero by midcentury, and issued numerous executive orders to help achieve those goals. But 14 months into his presidency and a year since the summit, Biden is facing Russia’s war in Ukraine, rising global oil and gasoline prices, and the intransigence of climate change skeptics both at home and abroad ― and they are now threatening to derail his climate agenda altogether. Since launching his campaign for president, Biden has pledged to make climate change a centerpiece of both his domestic and foreign policy strategies. He would push countries like Brazil, where right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, to change course, while simultaneously enacting the most ambitious domestic climate agenda in American history. His early moves, and promises of further legislative and executive action to come, did succeed in bolstering U.S. climate credibility on the international stage, particularly among major European leaders who had been dismayed by Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accords, his formation of a convenient anti-climate alliance with Bolsonaro, and the United States’ general turn against any form of aggressive climate action. “There is a lot more credibility in the way that the U.S. wants to adopt an environmentally friendly policy,” said one European official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the Biden administration’s climate approach. “But there are also some difficulties in the implementation.” The opening three months of 2022 have shown just how big those difficulties are. Data released in January showed that U.S. carbon emissions rose sharply last year after a pandemic-driven downturn the year prior, highlighting the struggles Biden may face in curbing emissions overall as the U.S. economy bounces back to life. In early February, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) announced his opposition to Biden’s Build Back Better plan, a sweeping legislative proposal that initially included $555 billion in climate-related spending, derailing what would have amounted to the largest package of climate-focused initiatives in U.S. history. The same month, a surge of deforestation destroyed an area of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest equivalent in size to Washington, D.C. ― a record for the month of February ― all while Brazilian lawmakers launched a legislative push that could open even more of the forest to industrialization and destruction. And in the final week of February, Russia launched an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, sparking a crisis that, beyond its humanitarian implications, has also exacerbated oil supply crunches. In response, Republicans have demanded the U.S. “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production, while some Democrats have begged the Biden administration to abandon efforts to pass climate legislation, fearing it could crater the party’s hopes in looming midterm elections. Last week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year. The developments have put Biden’s planned international climate agenda in serious jeopardy. “It damages our credibility abroad when you have sweeping campaign promises being made … and then nothing happens,” said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International, a climate advocacy group. “You can only be the boy who cried wolf so many times on the international stage.” Brazil has long been at the center of Biden’s desire to make climate a foreign policy focus. During a presidential debate in 2020, he pledged to create a $20 billion international fund to help protect the Brazilian Amazon, and cited rampant destruction of the forest as a key failure of Trump’s foreign policy approach. But shifting geopolitical circumstances and the right wing’s fervent allegiance to fossil fuels and environmental exploitation have inhibited those plans almost from the beginning. Early in his presidency, Biden signed a climate-focused executive order that tasked his administration with developing a plan to “promote the protection of the Amazon rainforest and other critical ecosystems that serve as global carbon sinks.” And he sent former Secretary of State John Kerry, who now serves as Biden’s special climate envoy, and other key U.S. officials to Brasília for diplomatic talks meant to persuade the Bolsonaro government to abandon its most destructive policies. Negotiating better forest protections with Bolsonaro, a climate change denialist who has spent his presidency rolling back regulations and incentivizing deforestation, was always going to prove difficult. But it also offered an opportunity. By bringing Brazil, which had drastically reduced emissions and improved its rainforest protections in the past, back to the table, the U.S. could also prove its own bona fides. The on-again, off-again negotiations, during which Brazilian officials repeatedly insisted they needed advance payments to protect the forest, eventually resulted in a cursory pledge from the Bolsonaro government to put an end to illegal deforestation by 2028, two years earlier than Brazil had previously said it would. Throughout the process, Brazilian environmental experts and Indigenous tribes warned the U.S. not to trust Bolsonaro, who they feared would simply legalize deforestation now considered illegal and use any positive outcome ― and financial benefit ― to bolster his own political prospects. “The problem in the country is not money, the problem is the government,” said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a São Paulo-based environmental organization. “We have the money. We don’t have a government willing to face deforestation.” Still, the pledge came at a time when it may have seemed possible to “shift Bolsonaro’s focus,” said Mark Langevin, an expert on Brazilian energy and environmental policy at George Mason University in Virginia. He had replaced a hard-line environmental minister with an official many observers had hoped would approach the job more pragmatically. The reputational damage caused by a record outbreak of fires in 2019, and Bolsonaro’s persistent denials that they were even occurring, had also driven some modern elements of Brazil’s influential agribusiness industry to begin pushing the government to change its approach. Since the agreement, however, Bolsonaro has proceeded the way most environmental experts assumed he would. Brazil’s Congress is already considering a package of legislative proposals favored by Bolsonaro that would allow more large mining projects on protected Indigenous territories in the Amazon and ease regulations over the use of harmful pesticides, The Guardian reported in March. The bills could also lead to another surge in illegal land grabbing, a practice that has helped drive deforestation and violent attacks on Indigenous communities under Bolsonaro, thanks to his government’s lax enforcement of the law and its close ties to garimpeiros ― wildcat miners who have scoured the Amazon for its resources. Even as the forest faces ever-graver threats, Russia’s war appears to have shifted U.S. attention at least for the moment away from deforestation and toward another sensitive environmental topic. After the invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. placed broad new economic sanctions on Russia, including a ban on the import of all Russian fossil fuels. That has sent domestic gas prices ― already on the rise thanks to increased demand at home ― to record highs, which could have drastic political ramifications for Biden and the Democratic Party later this year. In an effort to prevent those increases, the Biden administration has sought to replace lost Russian fuel via other sources, including Brazil. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm urged her Brazilian counterpart, Bento Albuquerque, to boost oil production in a mid-March phone call. Albuquerque immediately agreed, he told Agence France-Presse. That’s a major priority for Bolsonaro, who has sought to paint the Russian war as “a good opportunity” to loosen environmental protections, boost oil production and ramp up mining on Indigenous territories within the Amazon that are rich in potassium, which could be used to produce fertilizer. (Brazil imports most of its fertilizer from Russia.) Brazil has plenty of company in seeking to leverage the crisis to bolster domestic industries. Australia and other coal-producing countries are embracing a surge in coal demand as European nations look to replace supplies from Russia. And Biden, who campaigned on a pledge to “take on the fossil fuel industry,” is facing a pressure campaign from that sector and allied Republicans to boost domestic production of oil and gas in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they seek to reduce reliance on Russian oil. But the posture toward Bolsonaro demonstrates the ways that Russia’s invasion complicated an already fragile global climate agenda. “The politics of climate, domestically and internationally, are so challenging,” Langevin said. “And now, all eyes are on Ukraine, which just takes all the oxygen out of the room.” It has shifted the U.S. posture elsewhere too. Last month, Biden announced plans to boost exports of liquified natural gas to help Europe transition off of Russian gas, which accounts for 40% of Europe’s supply. The deal with Europe, the administration argued, would speed the continent’s transition away from dirty energy sources altogether. “The president knows ... that the true path to energy security runs through clean energy, so that’s the second part of this agreement,” a senior administration official said on a call with reporters last month. “The first part is getting Europe off Russian gas. The second part is getting Europe off gas altogether. And he’s committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reaping the climate, environmental, economic and energy security benefits of moving decisively down that path.” But it also horrified climate groups in the U.S., who fear it will lead to a large-scale build-out of gas infrastructure and lock in years if not decades of pollution from what is already one of the key drivers of climate change. Methane, the main component of natural gas, accounts for one-third of all human-caused planetary warming. The fossil fuel industry, by contrast, applauded the move. This is the fine line the White House has walked both domestically and internationally: On the one hand, it has repeatedly stressed that Russia’s war is a reminder that the U.S. must speed up its transition to renewable energies in order to break free of a global oil and gas market that empowers bad actors and determines prices at home and abroad. On the other, it has responded to the Republican misinformation campaign about Biden being “at war with” fossil fuels by arguing that the administration has given the industry the tools it needs to increase domestic production. In a speech announcing a U.S. ban on imports of Russian fossil fuels, Biden noted that U.S. oil and gas companies pumped more during his first year than during Trump’s, that production is forecast to reach a record high in 2023, and that the industry has stockpiled more than 9,000 unused but approved permits to drill across millions of acres of federal lands. “It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,” Biden said. The administration is pointing the finger at U.S. drillers for high prices at the pump, even accusing them of profiteering, while simultaneously trying to appease the industry. Granholm has called on producers to “rise to meet current demand” amid Russia’s invasion. And speaking to a room full of energy industry executives at the CERAWeek conference in Houston last month, Kerry said the Biden administration is committed to an “all of the above” future energy policy. It’s a pro-everything strategy that both Democrats and Republicans have championed for more than two decades, but that is increasingly out of sync with climate science. A report last month concluded that the U.S. and other wealthy, heavy-polluting nations must phase out oil and gas production altogether by 2034 if the world is to have a 50% chance of limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement. António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, recently warned that the war and ensuing pursuit of “all-of-the-above” energy could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees. “Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or kneecap policies to cut fossil fuel use,” he said. “Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.” A White House spokesperson said Biden has not wavered in his push for climate action, but said in the short term energy supply must keep up with demand. “We believe we can walk and chew gum ― address supply in the short term because families need to take their kids to school, and go to work, get groceries and go about their lives ― and often that requires gas,” the spokesperson said. “But in the long term we must speed up ― not slow down ― our transition to a clean energy future.” The State Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Along with ordering a massive draw on the nation’s oil reserves last week, Biden called on Congress to require oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases, as well as pass his stalled Build Back Better climate and social spending package. Early in his presidency, Biden said the U.S. would push the world forward on climate action in large part through leading by example. It couldn’t ask other countries to meet goals or take aggressive actions if it wasn’t willing to meet the moment itself. But the consensus among climate experts and advocates appears to be that while the Biden administration is talking the talk, it is not yet walking the walk — that the rhetoric has not translated into the aggressive policies that scientists say are required to, in the words of the United Nations’ most recent climate report, “secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” Even before Russia’s invasion, U.S. climate groups were disappointed in Biden’s ability to deliver at home. Greenpeace USA, a major environmental organization, gave his first year in office a failing grade on its running scorecard of Biden’s climate actions. The Build Back Better plan and its ambitious climate spending were the administration’s chief legislative vehicle to achieve many of its goals. But its future, as a climate plan or as any plan at all, was in doubt even before the invasion inspired Democratic skittishness about the political impact of rising gas prices and GOP calls to expand domestic oil and gas production. Biden has also come under fire from forest experts. Along with advancing several planned logging projects in mature, carbon-rich forests in the Pacific Northwest, the administration in November released a long-term strategy for slashing emissions that appeared to float cutting down old-growth trees and replacing them with younger stands as a solution to climate change and climate-fueled wildfires. Dozens of climate and public land advocacy organizations have since launched a national campaign to pressure Biden to enact rules to conserve remaining mature forests across the federal estate. John Noël, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said it’s been “disorienting” to watch fossil fuel permitting and production increase under Biden’s watch after the president described climate change an “existential threat.” “The overall mood is pissed, straight up,” Noël said. “It’s totally unacceptable.” Greenpeace USA is among more than 200 climate, social justice and progressive groups that sent Biden a letter last month urging him to “resist short-sighted policies such as scaling up domestic fossil fuel production” and instead to use his executive power, specifically by invoking the Defense Production Act, to speed up America’s transition to clean energy technologies and flight fossil fuel-driven planetary warming. On Thursday, Biden did invoke the Defense Production Act in an effort boost production of critical minerals used in batteries and clean energy technology. Similarly, the 98-member Congressional Progressive Caucus has called on Biden to take several actions that they argue would allow him to deliver on his campaign promises, including declaring a national climate emergency, reinstating a ban on crude oil exports, prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, and ending fossil fuel subsidies. At some point, the Biden administration has to pick a side, said Oil Change International’s Rees. “This desire to not make anybody mad is going to make everybody mad,” he said. “They need to decide if they are going to be with people or polluters.” Biden and his team seemingly have as much if not more work to do to prove themselves on the international stage. Ahead of last year’s COP26 climate summit, Biden pledged to double U.S. climate aid for developing nations from $5.6 billion to $11.4 billion per year by 2024. It was expected to close the gap on the U.S. and other rich nations’ decade-old broken promise of providing $100 billion in climate finance for low-income and vulnerable countries to develop clean energy and adapt to the mounting impacts of climate change. But when Congress passed its $1.5 trillion spending bill on March 10, less than two weeks after the United Nations’ latest dire climate study, it included a measly $1 billion in international climate aid — less than half of what the White House had requested. (To put that in perspective, the U.S. alone experienced 20 separate billion-dollar climate and weather disasters last year.) “This is devastating to the politics around climate action because there are so many kinds of initiatives and political developments that need those funds,” said Joseph Curtin, director of The Rockefeller Foundation’s power and climate initiative. “It’s a major impediment to progress.” On Monday, the White House released its $5.8 trillion federal budget for 2023. While Biden’s statement announcing the request did not mention climate, the proposal calls for $44.9 billion to tackle the crisis, including $11 billion in international climate aid. But the budget request is just that — a request — and the same congressional obstacles that have plagued Biden and his team from the beginning remain. There is still time for Biden to get things right on climate on the international stage, Curtin said. But with so much attention and resources being directed at the crisis in Eastern Europe, it’s going to require some juggling. In the eight months between now and the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Curtin said it is critical that Biden and his team shore up financial support for initiatives like Net Zero World, which is aimed at providing technical support for countries looking to accelerate a clean energy transition, and South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to speed up South Africa’s shift away from coal. The U.S., the European Union, France, Germany and the United Kingdom committed to invest a combined $8.5 billion toward the South Africa initiative. “I think [climate] is a high priority in the White House,” Curtin said. “But I think it’s taking a little bit of time to crank up the machinery, to deliver on these commitments. Rather than give a very negative grade, I’d prefer to wait and see and assume that the intention is there to deliver on some of these promises.” “Quite honestly, I can’t see any other way of arriving at COP27.” Reporter, HuffPost Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Weatherman Interrupts Live Broadcast To Warn His Kids About Tornado,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Reporting the weather was a really personal experience for one Washington, D.C. meteorologist on Thursday. Doug Kammerer of NBC Washington was doing a live broadcast about a tornado warning when he suddenly realized his own home was in harm’s way. Knowing his kids were home alone, Kammerer temporarily switched into dad mode and called home while he was still in the middle of his live broadcast, according to RawStory. “Kent, you there, buddy?” Kammerer said on his cellphone while on air. “Hey man, I want you to get down to the basement. We got a tornado warning. I want to make sure you and Callie get down as soon as you can.” Kammerer also told his kids, “Get in the bedroom down there and wait 10-15 minutes, OK. Do it now.” After the call, Kammerer told his colleagues and viewers he had a good reason to interrupt the live broadcast and call home. “I gotta warn my kids, because I know what my kids are doing right now, they’re probably online gaming. And they’re not seeing this,” he explained. Although Kammerer’s call was unorthodox, he got support from fellow meteorologist James Morrow, who works for at National Weather Service headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. “The decision to cut in is not easy for stations to do, and for meteorologists to ask permission to do,” Morrow told NPR. “But as a consumer of their feed, and a scientists who understands the risks of strong tornadic storms like this, it was heartening to see this type of coverage for what could’ve turned into a very serious situation.” Kammerer later admitted on Twitter that he found the situation a little nerve-wracking. Yes, had to warn my family! Kids were home alone and I knew they were not watching me on TV! They are safe. Thank you!

12,15 Underrated National Parks You Should Visit,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life The pandemic may have restricted travel over the past two years, but it also opened many Americans’ eyes to the beautiful sights in their own backyards. Indeed, the National Park System reported a record for visitors in 2020 and 2021, with travelers flocking to popular spots like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Park. But those famous destinations represent only a fraction of the 63 national parks in the U.S. And though you may not have heard of many of them, they are more than worthy of attention. We asked seasoned national park visitors and travel experts to share which of the 63 national parks they think are overlooked. Read on for 15 hidden gems to add to your national park bucket list. “There’s really no doubt in my mind that Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota is the most underrated national park in America,” said Jim Pattiz, co-founder of the organization More Than Just Parks. “Voyageurs really has it all,” he added. “Thousands of acres of pristine lakes and forests that are home to wolves, moose and world-class fishing. The kind of solitude you only get in the remote backcountry of most other parks, and nightly opportunities to see the northern lights in all their glory.” Pattiz recommended visitors spend time on the glassy lake waters and take in the spectacular sunrise and sunset views. “There’s something about gliding along in a canoe through a mosaic of placid water and wooded islands with only the sound of your oar and the calls of distant loons to fill the vast quiet space,” he said. “Voyageurs is the only park my wife and I go back to every year because it provides an outdoor sanctuary that other parks simply can’t seem to replicate.” “While North Cascades National Park is well known to outdoor enthusiasts in the state of Washington, it’s surprisingly underrated to the general public,” said Heather Gyselman, a product manager for adventure travel at REI. “Outside of Alaska, it’s home to more glaciers than anywhere else in the U.S. and set amongst some of the most magnificent mountains and peaks within the Cascade Mountain range.” She noted that the park is part of the North Cascades National Park complex, which also contains Ross Lake National Recreation Area and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. “All offer something special,” Gyselman said. “Whether you’re looking to escape gray skies on sunny Lake Chelan or find inspiration while standing in the midst of snowcapped peaks from Sahale Arm, there’s something for everyone.” Adventure travel blogger Andy Fine praised the park’s serene wilderness, breathtaking vistas and ease of access from Seattle. “The North Cascades offers an incredible mix of epic mountain views painted with the bluest lakes and spiring mountain peaks crowned by endless glaciers,” he said. “It’s rough around the edges, but when fully immersed in, the park can provide some lifetime worthy experiences.” “There are probably a dozen U.S. national parks that fly below the radar,” said Joe Yogerst, author of “50 States, 500 Campgrounds: Where to Go, When to Go, What to See, What to Do.” “One of my all-time favorites is Capitol Reef in Utah,” he added. ”[It’s] an incredible red-rock wilderness with awesome hiking trails, slot canyons and pioneer history that gets a fraction of the visitors that make summers super crowded at better-known parks in the Southwest, like Arches, Zion and the Grand Canyon.” Capitol Reef, in Utah’s south-central desert, includes popular sites such as Chimney Rock pillar, Hickman Bridge arch and the white sandstone formation known as Capitol Dome. “When folks travel to the Southwest, they often think of the Grand Canyon in Arizona or Zion in Utah, but another very overlooked park that should be added to your list is Saguaro National Park, just outside of Tucson,” said Will Pattiz, the other co-founder of More Than Just Parks. The park’s name pays homage to the iconic saguaro cactus, which visitors can admire throughout its desert grounds. The visual effect is pure American Southwest. “The sunsets at Saguaro National Park are perhaps the most spectacular of any you’ll find in the southwestern United States,” he added. “The Tucson valley creates especially long-lasting sunsets, with stunning purple and golden hues.” Kurt Repanshek, founder of National Parks Traveler, thinks Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota is one of the most underrated national parks. He noted that the landscape remains largely unchanged from when its namesake first explored the area. “The rutted and tortuous badlands, mottled grayish white, bluff and blue, present a maze,” he said. “And yet the river bottoms are alive with cottonwoods, shrubs and grasses that attract a range of wildlife. Most imposing are ponderous and powerful bison that demand respect and a wide berth.” Repanshek recommended exploring Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site and Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site nearby as well. “Another overlooked park is Dry Tortugas, a subtropical archipelago located at the very western end of the Florida Keys that you can only reach by ferry or seaplane,” Yogerst said. “You can explore a Civil War fort, scuba or snorkel coral reefs, and camp on the beach.” Indeed, this 100-square-mile park consists of mostly open water with a smattering of small islands, but visitors rave about the opportunities for marine exploration and the tour of historic Fort Jefferson on Garden Key. “Big Bend in West Texas is another special park that not a lot of people visit, probably because it’s not near any large cities and far off the interstates that people drive across the country,” Yogerst said. “For me, the best things about Big Bend is canoe camping through the deep canyons along the Rio Grande and hiking the forested Chisos Basin, an extinct volcano that rises high above the park’s desert terrain.” Gyselman also endorsed Big Bend, hyping its diverse terrain and impressive peaks. “In Big Bend National Park, you can enjoy colorful sunsets over the Chihuahuan Desert, hike through the gorgeous Chisos Mountains or cool off with a paddle down the Rio Grande,” she said. “It’s a park where you can unplug, reset and reflect.” And national parks travel expert Mikah Meyer pointed out that it’s accessible during the winter, unlike many other U.S. national parks. “With its most temperate days between October and March, Big Bend is a great winter escape for those looking for year-round park opportunities,” he said. “Perhaps one of the biggest hidden gem national parks is Denali National Park,” said Kate Brassington, co-founder of The Family Vacation Guide. “It can be a daunting choice due to its vast wilderness, but in reality it appeals to all ages and has something for every aged explorer.” She noted that the Alaska park has family-friendly accommodations, trails and attractions. “The park itself has limited cell reception, food services and water, alongside unpredictable weather conditions, so it means you need to be much more prepared than a more ‘conventional’ park choice, but trust that the views and experience will be worth it!” Brassington said. “From interactive exhibits to the park’s junior ranger program, it will be a hidden gem, trip of a lifetime.” “I think that Death Valley National Park is one of the most overlooked parks, mainly because the name seems to scare people away,” said Jack Steward, co-host of the “Rock the Park” TV series. “I think most people think that the park is just a massive pile of sand, but in reality it has tall mountains, beautiful canyons, bristle cone pines, which are the oldest trees on earth. It also has ghost towns, historic mining camps, over 900 miles of scenic roads to explore, and plenty of places to camp and hike.” Riley Mahoney, creator of the website The Parks Expert, noted that Death Valley is the largest national park in the Lower 48 and one of the most diverse, so there’s something for everyone to enjoy. “Within its borders, you’ll find the lowest point on the continent, Badwater Basin, at 282 feet below sea level,” she said. “From Dante’s View, a great place to view the sunset, you can see Mt. Whitney in nearby Sequoia National Park, the highest point in the continental U.S. Fans of ‘Star Wars’ will also find it’s as close as they may come to landing on Tatooine.” “There is something particularly beautiful about the underappreciated national parks,” said Martin Jones, CEO and travel expert at ParkSleepFly. “The serenity of the untouched locations provides for a unique experience and the opportunity to truly appreciate the stunning views, away from the hustle and bustle.” He believes that Glacier Bay in Alaska doesn’t always get a lot of attention, given its location, but is absolutely worth the trek from the continental U.S. “Those who have visited this spectacular park are clearly in love with its majestic fjords and glaciers and snow-capped mountains,” he said. “Glacier Bay is a real gem, and there are many different outdoor pursuits you can take part in whilst visiting this national park. Hiking in the mountains and kayaking on the open water are only a couple of the adventurous activities.” “The Everglades showcases spectacular views of wildlife, often engaged in phenomenal acts of natural history,” said Janisse Ray, naturalist and author of “Wild Spectacle: Seeking Wonders in a World Beyond Humans.” She advised visiting this “vast, subtropical wilderness” during the dry season, from November to April, to find wildlife concentrated around ponds and avoid the sweltering heat of summer in South Florida. “This is a place that never fails to surprise and bewitch,” Ray added. “Hiking through sawgrass prairies, hope to see large alligators or a Florida panther ― and kayaking in Ten Thousand Islands, hope for manatees, bottlenose dolphins and even crocodiles. The bird life is especially spectacular.” “Katmai National Park, in southern Alaska, is one of the least visited of all national parks, as it often requires a flight to Anchorage, a short flight to the town of King Salmon and then a boat or float plane to Brooks Camp,” said Derek Wright and Amy Beth Wright, outdoor enthusiasts and creators of Parks and Points. Katmai is best known for its population of coastal brown bears and their annual summer hunt for salmon. “The park service also runs a Fat Bear Week competition, where the public votes on their favorite hibernation-ready bear,” the Wrights explained in an email. “It’s a life-changing experience to get to enjoy this yearly extravaganza in real life!” In addition to bear sightings, visitors can enjoy fishing, hiking and taking a tour of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, the site of the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. “Some of our highlights were waking super early to keep an eye out for a wolf combing the beach for breakfast in the dawn hours, and watching the sunrise and bright and pastel colors illuminate the sky over Lake Naknek,” the Wrights noted. “There’s no cell service and no public internet connection, so you really do disconnect from the digital world and fully immerse yourself in the park.” “Kings Canyon is often overlooked in comparison to nearby parks like Sequoia and Yosemite,” said travel blogger Renee Hahnel. “Many people don’t realize just how beautiful this park is, with its 14,000-foot mountain peaks, giant trees, lush meadows and deep canyons.” She pointed out that Kings Canyon runs deeper than the Grand Canyon and reaches depths of 8,200 feet in some places. “John Muir described Kings Canyon as a ‘rival to Yosemite,’ and he wasn’t wrong!” Hahnel added. “Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in western Colorado is another hidden gem ― boasting just a 10th of Rocky Mountain National Park’s visitors,” said Dan Austin, founder and director of special projects at Austin Adventures. He touted the jaw-dropping canyon views of cliffs darkened by shadows and recommended going in the morning to snag an unforgettable photo. “Along the seven-mile-long rim drive, there are 12 fantastic overlooks, including an opportunity to see the Painted Wall with its pinkish rock veins in stark contrast to the black rock around them,” Austin said. “Make sure to also go below the rim on the five-mile road where a 16% grade will give you the full sense of how steep the canyon is. There’s a great riverside picnic spot and camping area at the end.” “Located 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, Lake Clark is home to some of the country’s most breathtaking scenery,” Hahnel said. “Visitors are treated to an abundance of mountains, jagged granite spires, impressive glaciers, active volcanoes, thundering waterfalls, the largest lake in the state and a lively coastline.” Like Katmai, Lake Clark is also famous for its large brown bear population and opportunities to view them as they fish for salmon. “Park biologists have counted as many as 219 brown bears within a 54-square-mile area on the coast!” Hahnel said. “Visiting Richard Proenneke’s cabin on Upper Twin Lake is also a must when visiting Lake Clark.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life"
13,"Mehmet Oz Goes Full Climate Denial, Says Carbon Dioxide Isn't A Problem",environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Politics Reporter, HuffPost Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor turned GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, declared Wednesday that carbon dioxide is not a climate problem because it accounts for just a small fraction of the air in Earth’s atmosphere, a longtime talking point of climate change deniers. Oz made the remark during a forum in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he and his Republican rivals were asked how they would address soaring energy prices as U.S. senators. In a combative primary, the political newcomer known for hosting a long-running daytime TV show has taken heat for his past stance against fracking due to health concerns, which his campaign has disavowed. Each of the candidates onstage argued that Pennsylvania, one of the nation’s largest energy-producing states, should tap even more of its resources. “As a scientist, I’ll tell you the Green New Deal is a lie,” said Oz, who is a medical doctor, not a climate scientist. He was referring to what is little more than a loose set of guiding principles to combat global climate change. “It’s not just unfair because we’re sacrificing our energy independence. Actually, we want more than energy independence, we want energy dominance.” Then Oz launched into a talking point that would make even the most fervent climate deniers proud. The “ideology that carbon is bad” is “a lie,” he said. “Carbon dioxide, my friends, is 0.04% of our air. That’s not the problem.” Carbon dioxide is absolutely the problem when it comes to planetary warming. CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity are the main driver of climate change, accounting for more than three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. Oz’s comment is one climate deniers have been making for years, but it also comes just short of parroting another favorite denialist talking point: that carbon dioxide emissions are “beneficial” to crop production and the lushness of the planet. On the campaign trail, Oz has portrayed himself as a longtime champion of Pennsylvania’s gas industry. He’s posted videos of himself bemoaning Biden’s energy policies while pumping gas and has taken a particular liking to something he said people chanted at a town hall in Pennsylvania earlier this month: “Back off Biden! Give us freedom to frack!” Back off Biden and give us the freedom to Frack! pic.twitter.com/XkIE6qV4R0 But as HuffPost first reported, Oz’s affinity for hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is new. As a TV celebrity doctor, Oz co-authored multiple articles warning his readers about the potential health and environmental risks associated with the drilling technique, which involves pumping a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to release oil and natural gas. The practice is widespread throughout Pennsylvania. At Wednesday’s forum, former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick brought up Oz’s past columns that caution against fracking, which Oz’s campaign claims were actually authored by someone else. “Mehmet, in your particular case, in your shows and in your columns, you’ve argued for more regulation in fracking,” McCormick said. “You’ve made the case that there’s health effects from fracking, and you’ve argued for a moratorium in Pennsylvania, like what’s in New York.” “That’s not true,” Oz interjected. “That’s a lie and you know it’s a lie.” In a 2014 health and wellness Q&A, Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, then the chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, wrote that it was “a fact” that fracking pumps “toxic chemicals” deep into the ground and advocated for states and municipalities to follow New York’s lead, which at the time had placed a moratorium on fracking pending the outcome of a health study. In a 2015 piece published in right-wing news outlet Newsmax titled, “Surprise! Fracking May Cause Birth Defects,” the two highlighted then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s subsequent decision to permanently ban fracking statewide, writing that the governor had “heard enough.” Oz and Roizen went on to call for legislation that “requires anyone who profits from a fracking site to drink the local water.” Oz and Roizen also authored a column in 2017 highlighting the many ways climate-fueled extreme heat, wildfires, floods and infectious disease outbreaks are harming public health. Oz’s campaign has attempted to distance Oz from his previous medical columns, despite the fact that his name is on them, claiming that many of the views in them belonged entirely to Roizen. “Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen have very different positions on energy policy and fracking,” Brittany Yanick, the campaign’s communications director, told HuffPost earlier this month. “Dr. Roizen took over sole management of the daily column in 2009 and when they disagreed on views, he was supposed to clearly specify he felt a different way than Dr. Oz — these are clear examples that he didn’t do that.” Wednesday’s forum, hosted by the Manufacturer and Business Association in Erie, was the first time that Oz and McCormick, the two front-runners, appeared together at a public event, along with Republicans Jeff Bartos, a real estate developer, and Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator.

14,Monkeys Near Florida Airport Becoming Simian Celebrities,environment," DANIA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — As departing jetliners roared overhead, an aging vervet monkey moped on a mangrove branch one recent afternoon in the woods he inhabits near a South Florida airport, his ego bruised. Mikey, as he is called by his human observers, has long been the laid-back alpha male of a troop of monkeys ruling this tract of land, tucked off a busy runway at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. But this day he lost when challenged by a feisty youngster called Spike. Mikey fled screaming and was now sullenly staring at humans watching him from 15 feet (4 meters) away. “Did you have a bad day?” asks Deborah “Missy” Williams, a Lynn University science professor who has been studying the troop and others nearby since 2014. She is also founder of the Dania Beach Vervet Project, which seeks to preserve this unique colony. “We will leave you alone so you can ponder.” The United States has no native monkeys, but the smallish vervets have roamed Dania Beach since the late 1940s after a dozen brought from West Africa fled a now long-closed breeding facility and roadside zoo. Today, 40 descendants are broken into four troops living within 1,500 acres (600 hectares) around the airport. Florida also has a few colonies of escaped macaques and squirrel monkeys. Florida wildlife officials often kill invasive species to protect native animals. But they tolerate the vervets, if they stay put. The monkeys are local celebrities, their travails detailed by TV and newspapers, and popular visitors with nearby workers, who feed them despite signs saying that’s illegal. “My friends are like, ‘You have monkeys at your job?’” laughed airport parking lot attendant Harlen Caldera as she gave them raisins and nuts. Some ate from her hand, while others snatched what food she scattered. Travelers are often surprised to see the monkeys. They squeal in delight and grab their cellphones, hoping for photos. Vervets are gray and black with a greenish tinge, helping them blend into the trees. Males typically grow to 2 feet (0.6 meters) and 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms); females reach 18 inches (0.5 meters) and 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). They live about 20 years. Caldera and her coworkers are protective of the monkeys, which have no fear of humans, making sure no one tries to catch or harm them. “You never know what people will do,” she said. The entrance to the 16 acres (6.5 hectares) ruled by Mikey, the matriarch, Snow White, and their troop is at the parking lot’s rear, sealed by a locked fence. The mangrove trees are thick and the trail muddy — except where it’s covered in shallow water. Williams began studying monkeys while doing doctoral work at Florida Atlantic University, and stayed on. As she and her guests waded deeper into the monkeys’ grounds one recent afternoon, the 16-member troop approached. The colony lives on spiders, ants, lizards, seeds and flowers — when not scrounging people food. “They quickly learn to adapt to a human diet — they love sugary things and salty things,” Williams said, noting they tolerate human food remarkably well. In Africa, vervets are eaten by leopards, eagles and snakes. But in Florida the dangers are outside the mangroves — mostly cars and trappers, who sell them as pets. Because of their small population, Williams is concerned inbreeding will harm the monkeys’ health. In Africa, vervet males leave their birth troop when they reach sexual maturity at 5 years and join another. They move again every few years. With only four local troops, there isn’t enough rotation among the males, making the genetic pool small. As monkeys are an invasive species, Florida puts tight restrictions on how Williams’ group can help them. Trapped monkeys can’t be released — they must be euthanized or placed into captivity. As Williams doesn’t believe monkeys should be pets, she doesn’t seek veterinary care for seriously injured and ill monkeys, hoping nature will heal them. But her group is building an enclosure for vervets captured for treatment or because they wandered too far. Ultimately, Williams wants Florida to allow the release of captured vervets. Unlike Burmese pythons, iguanas and other invasive species, she argues, the colony doesn’t harm the environment. “The monkeys’ lives matter regardless if they are nonnative or native,” she said. “All options should be exhausted to avoid euthanasia.” Her models show that without change, the colony will die off within 50 years. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded that while the colony can remain, no exception allowing the monkeys’ release after capture can be made because their effects on the ecosystem are “not well understood.” “There is also an inherent risk of injury when handling wildlife. Monkeys can act defensively and may bite or scratch. Mammals, including vervet monkeys, may harbor diseases transmissible to humans including rabies,” the statement said. As darkness neared, the troop moved from the mangroves into the airport parking lot. It’s dinner time and there are seeds to pluck and workers’ treats to get. Some played while others groomed each other. Spike and Mikey again tussled before Williams’ admonition separated them. The aging king and his would-be heir then sat feet apart, eyeing each other warily. Soon sated, the monkeys climbed back into their trees to spend another night in their unexpected realm, paying no heed to the loud metallic birds flying above."
15,"Van Packed With Kangaroos, Wallabies Escapes Shell-Shocked Kharkiv Zoo",environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Kangaroos and wallabies whose enclosures were shelled at a Ukrainian zoo are now safe thanks to the efforts of a brave driver whose video has since gone viral. The Feldman Ecopark in Kharkiv posted a video earlier this week showing the confused-looking creatures in the back of a van with straw spread out on the floor. Ukraine’s foreign ministry later shared a clip on Twitter. These kangaroos were evacuated from Feldman Ecopark in #Kharkiv. Their enclosures were repeatedly shelled by #Russian Armed Forces. Now kangaroos are safe 💙💛#StopRussianAggression#closeUAskyNOW#StandWithUkraine️ pic.twitter.com/gdNfzN2bui “Today is a month since the beginning of the war, and we’re continuing the evacuation of the animals,” the driver says in the Facebook video, according to a translation from The Washington Post. While the zoo and ministry each mentioned kangaroos, the video also shows wallabies in the van, Max Pulsinelli, spokesperson for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told HuffPost. Wallabies are slightly smaller, close cousins of kangaroos. The animals’ enclosures have been “repeatedly shelled” in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the zoo said in its Facebook post. It also noted that by the time the video was posted, the marsupials had gotten to their destination and were “already safe,” though the post did not specify where they went. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has faced heavy shelling throughout the Russian invasion, and the Ecopark has not been spared. In early March, Russian bombs killed two employees of the zoo who were trying to feed the animals, the BBC reported. Numerous animals at the park have also been killed, while others, like deer and moose, have been set free into the forest by zookeepers who felt they had better chances surviving on their own. Many of the zoo’s surviving animals have also already been successfully evacuated, including great apes, monkeys, turtles, birds, alpacas and a lion, according to NPR. Many workers at zoos across Ukraine have chosen not to evacuate themselves to remain and care for their animal charges, who are often stressed and terrified from the sounds of shelling. Evacuating zoo animals can pose major challenges due to the size of some animals and the highly specific needs that different species have, and the logistics become even harder during a war, when normal routes become inaccessible and usually routine supplies are hard to get. Last week, a lion and wolf were evacuated from a zoo in southeast Ukraine, and had to be driven in the back of a van with no tranquilizers ― a dangerous situation for both the animals and the drivers. Animals remaining in zoos are at risk not only from bombs, but from running out of food due to a combination of shortages and their regular visitor revenue becoming nonexistent. At least one zoo has asked people around the world to help feed its animals by buying tickets online, even though a real-life visit is clearly off the table. Assignment editor, HuffPost"

0,This Texas City’s Water Crisis Is Shaping A Democratic Congressional Primary,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Days before Texas’ Democratic primary elections on March 1, congressional candidate Jessica Cisneros was shuttling back and forth to a friend’s house to shower and draw water for cooking. An estimated 125,000 Laredo residents had to boil their tap water for 13 days after the city’s main water line ruptured in late February. Cisneros and her family were part of a smaller subset of residents whose water was shut off completely for five days. Laredo has issued a water boil notice six times since September 2019 for some or all residents because the local government was unable to guarantee the water’s safety. The final pre-election disruption added a layer of inconvenience to Cisneros’ packed campaign schedule. But it also reinforced her reasons for challenging nine-term U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar for the Democratic nomination in Texas’ 28th Congressional District. “He’s had 17, 18 years to show the improvements in the community that he’s been able to accomplish in his tenure,” Cisneros told HuffPost. “But we don’t even have water here.” Coverage of Cisneros’ two runs against the more conservative Cuellar — he defeated her by less than four percentage points in 2020 — has understandably focused on the two Democrats’ major ideological and policy differences. But HuffPost’s conversations with voters in Texas’ 28th suggest that their opinions of Cuellar’s tenure and their relative appetite for change were more important indicators of their candidate preference than ideology. Now, as Cisneros prepares to face Cuellar in a May 24 runoff — neither candidate obtained an outright majority on March 1 — she is making the lack of consistent drinking water in Laredo, both candidates’ hometown, a central part of her argument that the district needs new representation. Although the federal government is obviously not responsible for Laredo’s water infrastructure, a core component of Cuellar’s pitch to voters is that his seat on the House Appropriations Committee has brought the struggling district a steady flow of much-needed federal dollars, she noted. “Where’s that money going to?” Cisneros asked. “Because half of the city of Laredo didn’t have running water” as voters were casting ballots in Cuellar’s reelection race. Cisneros has also seized on comments that Cuellar made that appeared to downplay his influence over local policymaking. Earlier this month, Cuellar told the Laredo Morning Times that while he would like to secure the city more federal funds to update the city’s water infrastructure, his influence over the local government is limited. “That’s a local issue,” Cuellar said. “City Council should have done the replacement for many years, they just never did.” To Cisneros, that answer doesn’t cut it. “Being a congressperson isn’t just about what you vote on,” Cisneros said. “It’s about being a leader and making sure that you’re generating pressure, bringing attention to issues, and making the effort to talk to voters directly about what their needs are and what the person in office can do to make sure those needs are met.” Asked by HuffPost to respond to Cisneros’ criticisms, Cuellar’s office provided a lengthy statement from Cuellar documenting both the federal funding he has acquired for Laredo’s water infrastructure and his efforts to coordinate with the local government. In the statement, Cuellar touted his work securing the appropriation of $35 million for the renovation of Laredo’s Jefferson Water Treatment Plant in 2013 and claimed credit for helping ensure that the government of Laredo received $95 million from President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan relief bill. He also said he voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that provided the state of Texas with $30 billion in funding, from which Laredo could benefit. In addition, Cuellar pointed out that he has been in frequent contact with the head of San Antonio’s water authority, who has been advising Laredo on restoring clean water during the recent boil notices. Cuellar also said that he and his team have spoken often to Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz (D), city council members and their staffs about opportunities to apply for federal funding that might help the city update its water system. “Congressman Cuellar not only has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to address the Laredo water issue, but has worked with the City directly to apply for eligible funding,” Cuellar said in a statement. “Congressman Cuellar will continue to be in constant contact with the Mayor and the City to work hand in hand to solve this local issue.” Cisneros has also sought to connect Laredo’s water struggles to Cuellar’s record of siding with the fossil-fuel industry against clean water regulation. In February 2017, mere days after then-President Donald Trump took office, Cuellar was one of just four House Democrats to vote in favor of overturning a federal rule aimed at protecting streams from coal mining waste. While the rule likely would have made some forms of coal mining not economically viable, the rule’s defenders pointed to research showing it would also reduce the presence of contaminants in some regions’ sources of drinking water. Amy Travieso, a former Cuellar deputy chief of staff-turned-U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist, lobbied for passage of the law overturning the rule. Asked why Cuellar’s support for a bill that only affected coal-mining regions was relevant to his record in Texas’ 28th, Cisneros told HuffPost it spoke to his callous approach to clean drinking water overall. “If he’s willing to sell out the basic needs of those communities — drinkable, safe water — what would he do for this area as well?” she said. The Cuellar campaign did not respond to a request for a response to Cisneros’ criticism of the 2017 vote. As with any complicated infrastructure issue, there is no single explanation for Laredo’s water troubles. On the one hand, the city’s water challenges appear to stem from a lack of resources. The water line that ruptured in February is more than 50 years old. Replacing the central water pipes and tanks in just the city’s core areas would cost $500 million, according to Saenz, Laredo’s mayor. But several previous water boil notices were due to a lack of adequate chlorination of the water supply rather than a break in the water pipe. Some Laredoans, including a group of frustrated residents who have formed the grassroots group AGUAS — an acronym that spells out “waters” in Spanish and translates to “Action of People United for Safe Water” — blame local mismanagement and corruption as well. They accuse the city government of failing to treat the problem with sufficient urgency in part because it disproportionately affects Laredo’s less-prosperous south side and the unincorporated “colonia” communities east of the city that lack representation on the city council. AGUAS has asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, to penalize the city government for failing to notify residents about the low chlorine levels within 24 hours of the state agency confirming that a water boil notice was necessary in September 2019. “Our one-dollar bill — it has the same value in the barrios as it has in other areas of Laredo, which are much wealthier and are better developed,” said Carlos Blanco, an AGUAS activist who has stopped drinking tap water altogether. Blanco would not say whether he prefers Cuellar or Cisneros. But Cuellar’s detractors believe that the congressman, who is also a former Texas state representative and Texas secretary of state, could use his considerable influence to facilitate greater changes in local governance. Not just an ordinary federal lawmaker, Cuellar’s roots in Laredo run so deep that he is sometimes called the “King of Laredo.” His brother Martin is the longtime sheriff of Webb County, where Laredo is located, and his sister Rosie served as county tax assessor. The Cuellar family has “done some good for the community,” said Verennise Arellano, a Laredo school teacher who cited the water issues as part of the reason why she supported Cisneros in both 2020 and 2022. “But it gets to the point where you don’t see any change anymore, where everyone is complacent.” Arellano is not exactly a card-carrying leftist. Despite the availability of more progressive candidates, she voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. She is instead motivated by a desire for change, even if it means taking a chance on someone without experience in elected office. “We need to have a fresh person,” Arellano said. “Maybe we’re wrong — Jessica might not be the person we’re looking for. But we need the change. We need to see it.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

1,"Colorado Wildfire Forces Evacuation Of More Than 19,000 People",environment," BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Authorities issued an evacuation order for 19,400 people Saturday near a fast-moving Colorado wildfire in rolling hills south of the college town of Boulder, not far from the site of a destructive 2021 blaze that leveled more than 1,000 homes. The wildfire was fueled by wind earlier in the day and had grown to 122 acres (49 hectares) with no containment, Boulder Fire-Rescue spokesperson Marya Washburn said. The Boulder Office of Emergency Management said an overnight shelter was opened after evacuation orders covered 8,000 homes and 7,000 structures. No structures had been damaged. Winds and temperatures have died down, Washburn said. Officials expect to be dealing with the fire for several days due to heavy fuels, said Boulder Fire-Rescue Wildland Division Chief Brian Oliver. The fire is in an area where a blaze destroyed 1,000 homes last year in unincorporated Boulder County and suburban Superior and Louisville. Superior town officials told residents in an email that there were no immediate concerns for the community. Miller said her neighbors helped her escape along with her husband, Craig, their three adult sons and two dogs, Ginger and Chloe. She said the hardest losses from the blaze were things they didn’t look at much, like baby shoes, family pictures and letters from her grandmother. “I feel exhausted by all of this, and I just feel like enough as far as these fires and disasters,” she said. She pointed to a recent Texas wildfire that left a deputy dead and homes destroyed. “ ... So I’m standing there and it’s just kind of a repeat.” Saturday’s fire started around 2 p.m. and burned protected wildland near the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder police said. Authorities have called it the NCAR fire and its cause is not yet known, said Washburn. ___ Associated Press photographer Damian Dovarganes contributed to this report."
2,Deer Keep Leaping Off A Pennsylvania Highway Bypass To Their Deaths,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Transportation officials in Pennsylvania are investigating a disturbing phenomenon involving a highway bypass where around two dozen deer have leapt to their deaths over the past few years. “They panic, one jumps off, and they all leap off,” Johnsonburg resident Bill Boylan, who lives near the U.S. 219 bypass told local news station WJAC. He told the news outlet that since he lived near the bypass, “we’ve had 25 deer jump to their death in a populated area.” The deer leaping off the bypass all appear to be female, fellow resident Julie Padasak told WJAC, calling the situation “disturbing.” The sad episodes have been “periodic” over the course of several years, Boylan told The Philadelphia Inquirer, but he fears that the sad situation could be dangerous for humans as well. A white-tailed doe typically weighs  between 80 and 160 pounds. The distance from the top of the bypass is about 60 feet, Boylan told the Inquirer. Residents of a northwest Pennsylvania town are trying to prevent deer from continuing to jump to their deaths off a bypass. >>>> https://t.co/yZONogkPH9 Boylan said he’s been complaining to the the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for years and wants it to do something to prevent the deer from going onto the bypass. PennDOT told WJAC it’s “taking a look” at the situation and hopes to have more information about the root cause of the problem “over the next couple of weeks.” Deer have been known to jump to their deaths on other human-built structures in the past. In 2005, five deer climbed on top of a five-story parking garage in West Virginia and leapt off. “They took the plunge,” police Cpl. Steve Cox told The Associated Press at the time. “It was just absolutely weird.” In 2017, a couple driving in Cedar Rapids, Iowa were horrified to witness a group of four “panicked” deer all vault over a bridge’s barrier, falling 20 to 30 feet to their deaths. And in 2019, Oklahoma game warden Carlos Gomez, who had to remove the bodies of two deer beneath an overpass, told Tulsa World that deer becoming confused by human structures and leaping to their death likely “happens more than we know.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
3,Iditarod Mushers Punished For Giving Sled Dogs Shelter From Snowstorm,environment," ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A fierce winter storm in the last stretch of this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog, which ultimately forced six mushers to scratch the same day, now has cost three other mushers for sheltering their dogs instead of leaving them outside in the harsh conditions. Mille Porsild of Denmark, Michelle Phillips of Canada and Riley Dyche of Fairbanks were penalized for taking dogs inside shelter cabins to ride out the storm with winds so strong, they whipped up white-out conditions, the Anchorage Daily News reported Friday. The decision to punish the mushers was made by race marshal Mark Nordman, who said the indoor rest for the dogs amounted to a competitive advantage over teams that trailed them into Nome. “No doubt that Michelle and Mille did the right thing for their dogs,” Nordman said. “But it also affected the competition for racers going forward.” Porsild was dropped from 14th to 17th position, while Phillips dropped one notch to 18th. Dyche wasn’t demoted in the standings, but he was fined $1,000 after officials determined there were no other mushers close to him that would have been affected by the dogs resting inside. The drop in finishing position equated to $3,450 less for Porsild and $1,000 less for Phillips. The nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska was won March 15 by Brent Sass, who was also affected by the storm just as he was nearing the finish line in Nome. He said he fell off the sled and couldn’t see anything, and thought he was going to have to hunker down with his dogs and ride out the storm. The demotion of the three mushers, which was not widely publicized by the Iditarod, immediately drew a harsh retort from the race’s biggest critic, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. “Nothing makes it clearer that this death race must end than the fact that the Iditarod slapped mushers with a fine as punishment for acting to prevent dogs’ deaths,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement Friday. She called for cruelty charges to be filed against mushers who did leave their dogs outside while they went inside shelter cabins, “Cruelty is baked into this deadly race, and it’s time for it to stop.” Porsild defended her decision bring the dogs inside. “Stopping and having the dogs in the shelter cabin gave Michelle and I no competition edge; on the contrary we both lost the edge we had — especially me and my team,” she wrote to the Daily News from Denmark. Iditarod rules say dogs cannot be taken inside shelters except for race veterinarians’ medical examination or treatment. However, the entry immediately after that one in the Iditarod rule book says: “There will be no cruel or inhumane treatment of dogs. Cruel or inhumane treatment involves any action or inaction, which causes preventable pain or suffering to a dog.” Four mushers — Matt Hall, three-time champion Mitch Seavey, Lev Shvarts and former champion Joar Leifseth Ulsom — filed complaints against Porsild and Phillips. Hall and Seavey were each moved up a spot when Porsild and Phillips were demoted, and Shvarts moved up two spots. “There was no doubt to me that my dogs sitting unprotected in these conditions could lead to death or deaths of dog(s),” Porsild wrote in an email to Nordman after the race, explaining why she did it. “With no natural wind breaks or materials available to shelter them I made what I felt was the best choice for my dog’s welfare in that extreme situation,” Phillips wrote on Facebook. Separately, Dyche also took his team inside a different shelter cabin to avoid the storm and was fined for not informing race officials he did so. Dyche told the newspaper that he knew it was a violation to bring the dogs inside, but he had no choice after failing to improvise a windbreak for them. He said as he sat in the cabin with the dogs for the next 24 hours and heard the winds hammer the cabin, he knew he made the right decision. Porsild, who returned to Norway after the race, was not informed by race officials of the demotion. She found out only when Phillips told her days later. Phillips announced on Facebook that this was her last Iditarod."
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Scientists Figure Out How Vampire Bats Got A Taste For Blood,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have figured out why vampire bats are the only mammals that can survive on a diet of just blood. They compared the genome of common vampire bats to 26 other bat species and identified 13 genes that are missing or no longer work in vampire bats. Over the years, those gene tweaks helped them adapt to a blood diet rich in iron and protein but with minimal fats or carbohydrates, the researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances. The bats live in South and Central America and are basically “living Draculas,” said co-author Michael Hiller of Germany’s Max Planck Institute. About 3 inches (8 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 7 inches (18 centimeters), the bats bite and than lap up blood from livestock or other animals at night. Most mammals couldn’t survive on a low-calorie liquid diet of blood. Only three vampire species of the 1,400 kinds of bats can do that — the others eat mostly insects, fruit, nectar, pollen or meat, such as small frogs and fish. “Blood is a terrible food source,” said Hannah Kim Frank, a bat researcher at Tulane University, who was not involved in the study. “It’s totally bizarre and amazing that vampire bats can survive on blood — they are really weird, even among bats.” Some other creatures also have a taste for blood, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, leeches and fleas. The latest work expands upon research by another team that pinpointed three of the 13 gene losses. “The new paper shows how different vampire bats are from even other closely related bats, which eat nectar and fruit,” said Kate Langwig, a bat researcher at Virginia Tech, who had no role in the study. With such a low-calorie diet, vampire bats can’t go long without a meal. In a pinch, well-fed ones will regurgitate their food to share with a starving neighbor. They seem to keep track of who has helped them in the past, said Hiller, noting that vampire bats have complex social relationships. “It’s not a kin thing,” said Tulane’s Frank. “They just notice and remember: You’re a good sharer, I will reward you.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

11,Ice Shelf Collapses In Previously Stable East Antarctica,environment," An ice shelf the size of New York City has collapsed in East Antarctica, an area long thought to be stable and not hit much by climate change, concerned scientists said Friday. The collapse, captured by satellite images, marked the first time in human history that the frigid region had an ice shelf collapse. It happened at the beginning of a freakish warm spell last week when temperatures soared more than 70 degrees (40 Celsius) warmer than normal in some spots of East Antarctica. Satellite photos show the area had been shrinking rapidly the last couple of years, and now scientists say they wonder if they have been overestimating East Antarctica’s stability and resistance to global warming that has been melting ice rapidly on the smaller western side and the vulnerable peninsula. The ice shelf, about 460 square miles wide (1200 square kilometers) holding in the Conger and Glenzer glaciers from the warmer water, collapsed between March 14 and 16, said ice scientist Catherine Walker of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. She said scientists have never seen this happen in this part of the continent and that makes it worrisome. “The Glenzer Conger ice shelf presumably had been there for thousands of years and it’s not ever going to be there again,” said University of Minnesota ice scientist Peter Neff. The issue isn’t the amount of ice lost in this collapse, Neff and Walker said. It’s negligible. But it’s more about the where it happened. Neff said he worries that previous assumptions about East Antarctica’s stability may not be so right. And that’s important because the water frozen in East Antarctica if it melted — and that’s a millennia-long process if not longer — would raise seas across the globe more than 160 feet (50 meters). It’s more than five times the ice in the more vulnerable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where scientists have concentrated much of their research. Scientists had been seeing the ice shelf shrink a bit since the 1970s, Neff said. Then in 2020, the shelf’s ice loss sped up to losing about half of itself every month or so, Walker said. “We probably are seeing the result of a lot of long time increased ocean warming there,” Walker said. “it’s just been melting and melting.” And then last week’s warming “probably is something like, you know, the last straw on the camel’s back.” Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

12,World's Largest Wildlife Crossing Slated For Construction Over California Freeway,environment," LOS ANGELES (AP) — Groundbreaking is set for next month on what’s billed as the world’s largest wildlife crossing — a bridge over a major Southern California highway that will provide more room to roam for mountain lions and other animals hemmed in by urban sprawl. A ceremony marking the start of construction for the span over U.S. 101 near Los Angeles will take place on Earth Day, April 22, the National Wildlife Federation announced Thursday. The bridge will give big cats, coyotes, deer, lizards, snakes and other creatures a safe route to open space in the Santa Monica Mountains and better access to food and potential mates, said the wildlife federation’s Beth Pratt. “Crossings like this are nothing new,” Pratt said, noting there is one outside Yosemite for toads. “This one’s historic because we’re putting it over one of the busiest freeways in the world.” She helped organize the project along with other conservationists and state transportation officials. Pratt said the bridge will be the first of its kind near a major metropolis and the largest in the world, stretching 200 feet (61 meters) above 10 highway lanes and a feeder road just 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of downtown LA. Construction will take place mostly at night and won’t require any lengthy shutdowns of the 101 freeway, officials have said. It’s slated to be completed by early 2025. The $90 million price tag will be covered by about 60% private donations, with the rest coming from public funds set aside for conservation purposes. The span will be named the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, for the philanthropist whose foundation donated $25 million. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the project an “inspiring example” of public-private partnership. “California’s diverse array of native species and ecosystems have earned the state recognition as a global biodiversity hotspot. In the face of extreme climate impacts, it’s more important than ever that we work together to protect our rich natural heritage,” Newsom said in a statement Thursday. The star of the fundraising campaign was the mountain lion P-22. Famous for traveling across two freeways and making a huge Los Angeles park his home, the big cat became a symbol of the shrinking genetic diversity of wild animals that must remain all but trapped by sprawling development or risk becoming roadkill. Scientists tracking cougars fitted with GPS collars found over decades that roadways are largely confining animals in mountains that run along the Malibu coast and across the middle of LA to Griffith Park, where P-22 settled. Despite being the face of the project, P-22 is unlikely to use the bridge because he’s confined to the park many miles away. But many of his relatives could benefit, Pratt said. Some 300,000 cars a day travel that stretch of the 101 in Agoura Hills, a small city surrounded by a patchwork of protected wildland that the new crossing will connect. Drivers in the Liberty Canyon area will speed under the bridge 165 feet (50 meters) wide with brush and trees growing on top, seamlessly joining hillsides on both sides of the lanes. Architects designed the topography to be indistinguishable from the scenery on either side. Berms and hollows with high edges will block sound and light from the lanes below. Wildlife crossings — bridges and tunnels — are common in western Europe and Canada. A famous one in Banff National Park in Alberta spans the Trans-Canada Highway and is frequently used by bears, moose and elk. The Los Angeles-area bridge has enjoyed nearly universal support, unusual for a public works project. The draft environmental impact document received nearly 9,000 comments — with only 15 opposed, according to the wildlife federation."
13,16 Mistakes Tourists Make While Visiting Denver,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Denver has become a popular tourist destination thanks to its rich cultural history, thriving brewery scene, stunning parks and more. But visitors to the Mile High City don’t always know how to get the proper experience ― and many make their fair share of missteps. We asked Denver locals to share some of the faux pas they’ve observed. From packing the wrong outfits to underestimating the effects of the high altitude, here are 16 mistakes tourists often make while visiting Denver ― and some advice for avoiding these errors during your travels. “Don’t stay indoors, opt to go outside. We love our outdoors and you will, too. Hop in on a game of volleyball at Wash Park (Washington Park), or play a round of golf at one of the many courses throughout the city. There is something for everyone. So before you book a museum each day, consider a day outside.” ― Breanna Phippen, blogger at Bites with Bre “Don’t underestimate Denver’s altitude. Denver has an elevation of 5,280 feet, making us closer to the sun. Your body will need time to adjust to the altitude, which will affect working out, hiking and drinking. Make sure to pace yourself, stay extra hydrated, wear sunscreen and know that headaches and nosebleeds can happen while visiting the Mile High City.” ― Jamie Lee, blogger at The Denver Housewife “Book yourself a float tank, IV therapy or both. Your body will thank you. The altitude is no joke and can affect anyone. Sip your adult beverages slowly and don’t expect to hit any personal records in your fitness.” ― Phippen “Going out in the late afternoon without layers is a mistake when traveling in Colorado, particularly in the early spring and late fall. The air feels much warmer than the outside temperature from the sun, so you’ll be comfortable wearing a short sleeve or tank. However, as soon as the sun goes down over the mountains, it instantly feels much colder and you’ll want a jacket.” ― Shelby Elmore, a marketing professional “Denver is known for its uncertain weather. We can often see all four seasons in a day or week. Pack layers for your trip since it can snow until the middle of May, and heavy afternoon downpours and hailstorms are normal during summer afternoons. Wear comfortable shoes, hats, sunscreen and layers because you never know how the weather will change during the day.” ― Lee “Consider your footwear. Ditch the dress shoes or high heels for Birkenstocks and gym shoes. We appreciate the laid-back style, and the majority of bars, restaurants and even clubs require casual for their dress code.” ― Phippen “Share the road. We are a bicycle-friendly community. Road cyclists will always choose the bike lane, but remember they have the right to the full car lane. It’s also easier to get around the city by bike, scooter or foot, so ditch the car rental.” ― Phippen “The biggest mistake I’ve seen tourists make while visiting Denver is often overlooking all of the city’s hidden gems. Of the unique features that make Denver authentically local, guests should explore our small, distinctive neighborhood streets ― each anchored by one of our large, beautiful city parks. Guests can also enjoy hundreds of off-the-beaten-path, chef-driven restaurants, as well as plenty of small bars, breweries and quaint boutiques. Denver is a unique city in that it is both urban yet rural, outdoorsy yet chic, and cultured, yet rustic. It’s a great big city filled with a small-town atmosphere.” ― Tony Dunn, general manager of Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel “Pace yourself and hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Denver is the Mile High City, so if you are coming from sea level, be kind to your body and dial it back on physical exertion and alcoholic drinking until your body acclimates to the altitude. The city is famous for its outdoor activities and breweries, but if you want to be in a position to actually enjoy all that the city has to offer (rather than feeling sick or winded), please remember to slow it down at least for the first day or two, and be sure to drink lots of water!” ― Laura Young, blogger at New Denizen “You’d be surprised how much more the elevation seems to increase the effects of alcohol. Also, drink a ton of water, especially if you’re drinking, because you’ll feel much more dehydrated.” ― Elmore “Skip Rocky Mountain oysters. No, they are not oysters from the sea. Many tourists can be tricked by the name until they learn what they really just ate: deep-fried bull testicles.” ― Phippen “If you are canni-curious, talk to the budtender before eating the whole edible. As [Colorado is] one of the first states to legalize marijuana, Denver is a great destination for cannabis tourism. However, that goes in hand with our weed being strong. Take it easy when consuming. Our edibles can take a few hours to hit, too. For example, an edible chocolate bar sold as a 100-milligram package is divided into tiny 10-milligram squares. That little square alone is enough to send you to the moon.” ― Phippen “One mistake I see travelers make is that they feel the best restaurants are the ones in the heart of downtown or the ones with the best Yelp review. These can be good, don’t get me wrong. But the best is when you ask people (or strangers) from that city what their hidden gem is and why. It makes the experience more exciting and authentic. This way you aren’t always mystified by location or atmosphere, but you understand who’s living in the city and their contributions to it. This may take you off the normal route, but it’ll take you so much further with that unique memory to take from it.” ― Haley Paez, blogger at Mile High & Hungry “Denver is not the mountains. Those are to the west, and we are situated east of the mountains between the foothills and plains. If you are looking to head to the mountains without trekking to a ski town, plan a visit to Golden, Evergreen or Idaho Springs. All of these towns are within 20 to 40 minutes from the city.” ― Phippen “Don’t pass up the chance to devour breakfast burritos. Denver loves their breakfast burritos so much the mayor declared an annual statewide Breakfast Burrito Day (Oct. 14). We like our burritos served handheld-style, wrapped in a piece of foil and stuffed with green chili.” ― Phippen “Skip the coffee chains and caffeinate at one of the many roasteries like Huckleberry, Thump Coffee or Pablo’s Coffee, to name a few.” ― Phippen “Don’t miss a Broncos-colored sunset from one of the many outdoor patios. Speaking of patios, Denverites love happy hour ― they can start as early as 2 p.m. and stay as late as 7 p.m.” ― Phippen “While there is the free shuttle that runs up and down 16th Street Mall, this is not the best spot to be if you want to vacation like a Denverite. Hop on a scooter to RiNo and take a stroll through the RiNo art alley to find the freshest murals and art come to life. Walk to Larimer Square to shop the boutiques or take an Uber to Cherry Creek North for luxury shopping.” ― Phippen “A mistake I see is people predetermining cities based on expectation or comparing it to others. The beauty of all the cities and subcommunities of the world is their own personality that only they can provide. There’s value in every place, and it makes it more enriching to let the city be in the driver’s seat. A common one for Denver is that the food scene is weak compared to other places. But when you take the time to see who’s here and let them express their passion, you’re bound to be surprised.” ― Paez Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life"
14,Great Barrier Reef Hit With ‘Grim’ Sixth Mass Bleaching Event,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY — Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef is undergoing yet another devastating mass coral bleaching event, the fourth since 2016, the country’s marine park authority said Friday. It’s the sixth mass bleaching since 1998 and the first time the reef has been hit by such a disaster during a La Niña year, which typically brings cooler weather. Scientists who had hoped the season would give coral time to recover said the latest mass bleaching was a “grim” sign for the future. Bleaching happens most often when delicate coral polyps are effectively cooked by unusually warm water. Bleached coral, which turns a sickly white, can recover if water temperatures return to normal. But if the warm water lingers for too long, large swaths of reefs can die. “It is important to note that bleached coral is stressed but still alive,” the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in a statement. “If conditions moderate, bleached corals can recover from this stress, as was the case in 2020 when there was very low coral mortality associated with a mass bleaching event.” Having completed aerial surveys with @aims_gov_au, today we confirm the fourth mass bleaching event on the #GreatBarrierReef in seven years and the first ever under La Niña conditions. #climatechange #ClimateAction https://t.co/1fBKm4HpX7 I can assure you that measuring the decline of the #GreatBarrierReef, as it bleaches again and again, is the saddest part of being a marine scientist….. https://t.co/9eOntzur8B pic.twitter.com/D6m04xKuEc Still, bleaching has happened again and again on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016, and a study published in November found that just 2% of the structure had escaped bleaching over the previous 30 years. That figure is shocking, as the Great Barrier is the largest living structure on the planet, stretching nearly 1,500 miles and comprising more than 3,000 individual reefs. The Australian government has faced fierce criticism from scientists and environmental groups in recent years over its attempts to protect the reef with injections of cash. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a $700 million package to protect the structure in January, bolstering a $1.4 billion effort called the Reef 2050 plan. At the same time, Australia has largely failed to address the root cause of the reef’s demise: rapidly warming waters linked to climate change. Morrison has embraced the coal and gas industry, vowing to support mining for “decades to come,” and Australia’s emissions strategies are ranked as “highly inefficient” by the group Climate Action Tracker. “I make no apologies for Australia’s standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or economic interests,” Morrison said in November at the United Nations’ climate conference. “We have a balanced plan to achieve net zero by 2050, but we’re not going to make rural and regional Australians pay for that.” A United Nations team is currently in Australia to assess the reef’s status on the UNESCO world heritage list. The Australian government heavily lobbied to delay calls that the reef be listed as “in danger” last year. A meeting on that matter will now take place in June, after a pivotal Australian federal election. Environmental groups said the timing of the bleaching announcement was extraordinary. “The beloved, vibrant colors of the Great Barrier Reef are being replaced by ghostly white corals,” Greenpeace Australia campaigner Martin Zavan said in a statement. “It is vital that the UN mission currently surveying the health of the Reef is able to witness and record this climate damage firsthand, and not just the postcard-perfect locations the Morrison government chooses to showcase.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Remarkably Young Cheetah Cubs Hunt Gazelles After A Nudge From Mom,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A mother cheetah encouraged her cubs to attack a pair of newborn gazelles as a hunting lesson in Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Conservation Area ― and the youngsters responded with vigor, tour guide Francis Kijazi told Latest Sightings. (Watch the video below, but please note that the scene includes a kill.) What makes the recent moment so unusual is that the cubs are estimated to be 2 months old, far younger than the usual age to begin stalking prey. “Cheetah cubs will start hunting from 6 months old ― their mother will let them prey on smaller animals to teach them vital hunting skills that help them refine their technique,” Sarah Oxley, project administrator for the wildlife viewing platform Latest Sightings, told HuffPost. Kijazi said it was the first time in 12 years that he had seen such behavior from cheetahs so young. The hunting instinct appeared particularly strong in this bunch, especially one cub that body-slammed and bit one of the newborns. The video picks up after the mother’s encouragement. While one Grant’s gazelle appears to be under attack, there are two in the footage. The mother cheetah eventually shows up and the hunt takes a lethal turn. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Nevada Tribes Call For New National Monument Near Navy Bombing Range,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A coalition of four Native American tribes is lobbying for the establishment of a sweeping new national monument surrounding a Navy bombing range in central Nevada in order to permanently protect the area’s cultural and natural resources. Two leaders of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe met with senior Biden administration officials and members of Congress this week to pitch their vision for a Numu Newe National Monument spanning nearly 3 million acres of federal lands that are the ancestral home of the Paiute and Shoshone people. “Numu” and “Newe” mean “the people” in the Paiute and Shoshone languages. Four federally recognized tribes in Nevada — the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe, the Walker River Paiute Tribe, the Lovelock Paiute Tribe and the Yomba Shoshone Tribe — are supporting what would be Nevada’s fifth national monument. The site could be established via either a presidential proclamation or legislation. The proposed monument would consist of public lands east of Fallon, Nevada, and adjacent to the four tribes’ reservations. It would encompass the Stillwater, Clan Alpine, August and Desatoya mountain ranges, as well as Job Peak, also known as Fox Peak, which is central to the Northern Paiutes’ origin story. The area is already home to several designated wilderness study areas. The proposed area would be the largest U.S. national monument on land, dwarfing Utah’s 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. (The offshore Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument is much larger.) Area tribes, including the Fallon Paiute Shoshone, Walker River Paiute and Yomba Shoshone, have fiercely opposed the Navy’s effort to triple the size of Fallon Naval Air Station’s bombing and training range in the high desert east of Reno. The tribes argue that the planned expansion, currently on hold, would destroy cultural sites and burial grounds, and restrict access for religious ceremonies and other activities. The tribes see their proposal as a compromise that safeguards their sacred landscapes while allowing for the Navy to continue national security activities on the existing range. “While the Tribes value a strong military defense, the Navy acknowledges that they have been harmed by Naval Air Station Fallon operations, including the contamination of the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s Reservation, lack of access, constant flyovers, and the bombing of a sacred medicine rock,” reads a summary of the tribes’ proposal shared with HuffPost. “Protecting these lands is a step toward remedying historical wrongs and reducing the environmental justice implications of forcing tribes to bear the disproportionate burden of national defense training.” Over several days this week, Cathi Tuni-Williams, chair of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe, and Leanna Hale, the tribe’s director of land and water, and others presented their idea to top officials in the Biden administration, including Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Interior Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau. They also met with members and staff of Nevada’s congressional delegation, including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D) and staff of Rep. Mark Amodei (R). They met with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) earlier this month. Tuni-Williams told HuffPost she grew up fishing, hunting deer and rabbit, and gathering pine nuts in the mountains east of her tribe’s reservation. The area, she said, is a place where Paiute and Shoshone people return for retreat, serenity and prayer. “Our big purpose here is to recognize and honor our heritage and protect what we have left from years of natural resources dwindling, our sacred sites dwindling,” Tuni-Williams said. Protecting the area is about preserving an identity, Hale said. “Without these cultural lands, items and way of life, we cease to be numa,” she said, using an alternative Paiute term for “the people.” The campaign comes as the Biden administration looks to advance its goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 as a way to combat the dual climate and extinction crises. But national monuments have become a political lightning rod in recent years, and one as sprawling as what the tribes’ are asking for is sure to attract opponents. In 2017, then-President Donald Trump carved more than 2 million acres from a pair of national monuments in Utah — Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears — in what was the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history. But in October, President Joe Biden reversed the Trump-era rollbacks and restored the sites to their original boundaries. Five tribes — the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Ute Indian Tribe — consider the Bears Ears landscape sacred. The Nevada tribes now championing the designation of a Numu Newe National Monument say the proposal not only provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to get closer to its “30x30” conservation target, but to fulfill a joint order that Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack signed in November 2021. Among other things, the order directed federal agencies to “​​make agreements with Indian Tribes to collaborate in the co-stewardship of Federal lands and waters.” While in Congress, Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe of New Mexico and the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history, voiced deep concern about the Navy’s bid to expand its bombing range by more than 600,000 acres. “They’ve lived on the land since time immemorial, their ancestors are buried there,” Haaland told the Reno Gazette Journal in 2020. “The idea this land that is hallowed ground can be used for this type of training, it is really sacrilegious in a way.” The Interior Department declined to comment on the tribes’ national monument effort. During a congressional hearing in July, Rosen questioned Del Toro, then Biden’s nominee for Navy secretary, about the Navy’s request for a major expansion. The senator also expressed disappointment that the military branch hadn’t incorporated stakeholders’ suggested changes into its most recent legislative proposal. “It’s incredibly important to expand that Naval Air Station, as you know, and the range in order to accomplish our national security mission,” Del Toro said. “In doing so, it’s also equally important to respect the tribes that have sacred land there.” Del Toro’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Thursday. Rosen’s office also did not respond. A spokesperson for Cortez Masto confirmed that the senator met with the tribes earlier this month and is currently reviewing the proposal. Tuni-Williams said the tribes want to be good neighbors and to partner with the Navy, federal land managers and all other stakeholders to steward and manage the landscape. So far, the response to their idea for a monument has been positive, she said. “I’m really excited and I’m optimistic that we will be able to fulfill this proposal,” she said.

1,Cannabis Farmers Not High On Chemically Made THC,environment," Over the past few years, Jonny Griffis has invested millions of dollars in his legal marijuana farm in northern Michigan, which produces extracts to be used in things like gummy bears and vape oils. But now that farm — like many other licensed grows in states that have legalized marijuana — faces an existential threat: high-inducing cannabis compounds derived not from the heavily regulated and taxed legal marijuana industry, but from a chemical process involving less strictly regulated, cheaply grown hemp. “It’s going to make our farm obsolete,” Griffis, the chief operating officer of True North Collective, testified before Michigan’s Marijuana Regulatory Agency recently. “The $3 million or so that I’ve invested ... is going to be wiped out.” At the center of the issue is THC, marijuana’s main intoxicating component. While marijuana and hemp are the same plant — cannabis — the distinction between the two is a legal one, and comes down to the amount of THC in the plant, specifically the amount of a type of THC called delta-9. Hemp is defined in federal law by its low delta-9 THC content and is traditionally used for food, clothing and industrial applications. “Rope not dope” was long a motto for those who advocated the legalization of hemp. But since Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, authorizing the growing of hemp nationwide in accordance with state or tribal licensing programs, there’s been an unforeseen consequence: People exploiting what they see as a loophole in the law have taken that hemp, extracted a non-intoxicating compound called CBD, and chemically changed it — generally by the addition of solvents and heat — into various types of impairing THC. Unlike the completely artificial, often dangerous drugs known as K2 or Spice and called “synthetic marijuana,” the chemically created THC at issue here consists of molecules found naturally in cannabis, though sometimes in vanishingly small amounts. It’s far cheaper to produce THC chemically from hemp than to extract it from marijuana. Because it is derived from hemp, that THC — often in a form called delta-8 — can wind up in candies, vape oils and other products sold in gas stations, convenience stores and online, even in states where marijuana is illegal. The Food and Drug Administration warned last year that the substances pose a public health risk due to multiple factors, including the way they are marketed and because of potential contamination when manufactured. At least 17 states have banned such products, but they remain available in many, including the pioneering legal marijuana state of Washington, where gas station and vape-shop sales of THC created from hemp offer competition to the heavily taxed, regulated and tested marijuana market. Virginia lawmakers this month approved a bill to strictly limit the amount of THC allowed in hemp-derived products; Gov. Glenn Youngkin has not yet signed it. In Kentucky and Georgia, recent lawsuits have sought to establish that delta-8 products are legal; a Kentucky judge sided with hemp advocates there on Feb. 28, allowing the products to continue to be sold as lawmakers consider a ban. The U.S. Hemp Roundtable, a hemp industry association, has decried the use of hemp-extracted CBD to create intoxicating products, saying it “undermines the integrity of the hemp industry and intent of the 2018 Farm Bill.” Supporters call chemically derived THC economical and environmentally friendly. Hemp can be grown in vast fields outdoors, without expensive lighting systems, and can have a lower carbon footprint than marijuana. Further, processors can make a more consistent product using chemistry to make THC from CBD, they say, and regulators shouldn’t stand in the way of market innovations or pick winners and losers in the industry. They liken it to the synthetically created vanilla or caffeine added to food and drinks. “Most growers don’t like to hear this, because they feel like it’s taking away from their market, but it’s a great product,” said Abe Fleishman, of Northstar Hemp in Oregon. “It provides an opportunity for companies to scale production, for one, and to make a new product that is, in my opinion, cleaner than your regular THC products.” For critics, the safety isn’t proven; the process of making it can leave behind trace amounts of unidentifiable compounds. The method also allows for the manufacture of lesser-known cannabis compounds whose health effects aren’t well understood. Chemically produced THC is unlikely to displace the top-shelf dried cannabis flower preferred by many connoisseurs, but it is so cheap to make that it drastically undercuts marijuana growers who focus on the extract market, and who have spent a lot of time and money adapting to stringent rules for their industry. Griffis said he’s seen the price of delta-9 distillate drop from $50,000 a liter to $6,000 — and falling — as THC made from hemp floods the market. “It’s an issue that almost every state cannabis regulator is thinking about,” said Gillian Schauer, executive director of the Cannabis Regulators Association. “It’s presenting a lot of challenges to protecting public health and consumer safety, and also to protecting existing state cannabis markets.” And, Schauer said, THC chemically made from hemp is only the tip of the iceberg: It can also be made from bioengineered yeast, so regulators will soon find themselves wrestling with that as well. In Michigan, the Marijuana Regulatory Agency is considering rules that would allow processors to convert CBD into THC with written prior approval from the agency, which would require demonstrations of the conversion method and product testing. They would also have to label their product as synthetic — a suggestion that has angered processors who note that the molecules are found in nature. Oregon’s Liquor and Cannabis Commission gave marijuana licensees a six-month grace period to sell off intoxicating THC-from-hemp products they had already acquired before a ban takes effect in July. In California, hemp-derived THC products are not allowed in legal marijuana shops, but regulators are examining the steps necessary to allow them. Colorado and Washington, which in 2012 became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, last year made clear that synthetically derived cannabinoids, including THC, are not allowed in their legal industries. After an uproar from licensed growers who said they were being undercut, Washington’s Liquor and Cannabis board seized more than 1,600 pounds (726 kilograms) of chemically created THC products made by a single licensed marijuana company, Unicorn Brands. The board went on to ban them from the regulated market. For David Postman, the board’s chairman, THC made from hemp represents an industrialization of the cannabis industry that he isn’t sure voters wanted when they passed Washington’s legal marijuana law, which was billed as a harm-reduction measure. “The LCB and the majority of the cannabis industry do not think the legal market should include mind-impairing, lab-created THC,” Postman said. “Allowing synthetically derived THC in the state’s legal cannabis market could devastate the industry.” Vicki Christophersen, a lobbyist for the industry group Washington CannaBusiness Association, argues that the board’s approach is stifling innovation in ways that will make it tough for Washington to compete nationally, should the federal ban on marijuana ever be lifted. “The collaborations that occur between the hemp industry and the adult-use cannabis industry are not only inevitable, but they’re important,” she said. “We need to look at what is going to advance Washington’s industry alongside all the other competitor states that are advancing at a much higher speed than we are.” ___ Johnson reported from Seattle.

2,"Hospital In Doha, Qatar, Only Treats Falcons",environment," DOHA, Qatar (AP) — At first glance, the Souq Waqif clinic in the historic center of Doha, the capital of Qatar, could be any other state-of-the-art hospital. Nurses in blue scrubs move briskly through the bright wards, conducting rounds. Radiology and operating rooms whir with the beeps and blinks of monitors. Specialists squint at X-rays and masked doctors make incisions with all the high-tech tools of modern surgery on hand. There’s just one thing: The rooms are filled with falcons. In the tiny, wealthy emirate of Qatar, the desert birds are among the nation’s most pampered residents. Long revered across the Arabian Peninsula for their ferocity and hunting prowess, falcons today serve as sheikhly status symbols recalling a Bedouin past. The bond between falconers and their falcons has been an inspiration since the Paleolithic period, when drawings of the creatures first appeared on cave walls. Although less fashionable now than in the days of yore, the art of falconry is still passed down from one generation to the next in Qatar and other oil-rich sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. With demand growing in recent years, clubs that teach the sport have sprouted up across the region. Falcons compete in an increasing number of races and beauty contests. The finest falcons fetch at least a few thousand dollars and Qataris spare no expense to maintain their good health. “The establishment of the hospital was to support the hobby and heritage of raising falcons ... it’s a pastime that stretches its veins into multiple generations,” Souq Waqif hospital director Dr. Ikdam Al Karkhi recently told The Associated Press. “Keeping them alive and well is an essential duty.” Public hospitals like Souq Waqif offer expert care to sick and wounded hawks, roughly 30,000 a year. The marbled reception area bustles with owners and handlers bringing their birds in for check-ups, medical tests, feather replacements, orthopedic surgeries — and even something akin to mani-pedis. Falcon nail filing is very serious business, as birds transplanted from the desert wild to opulent homes in skyscraper-studded Doha or bred in captivity cannot easily find sharp surfaces on which to trim their talons. The falcon’s hunt may be a long-venerated tradition, but it’s also grisly work. The cornered prey at times puts up a fight, clawing an attacking falcon and hobbling its wings. Each of a falcon’s feathers is vital to its flight, necessitating careful feather replacement after a scuffle. Doctors pull from a bank of shed feathers to find one that perfectly matches the wounded bird’s breed — plumage of the same pattern, length and color. “If these damaged feathers remain, it can cause loss or reduction of the bird’s fitness,” Al Karkhi said. “They must be treated.” Hospital surgeons treat other casualties of the hunt, too. Falcons’ beaks and talons suffer damage from all that swooping and plunging and gobbling. In the clinic waiting room, falcons perch regally on their owners’ gloved wrists. The Qatari men in their flowing white robes treat the prized birds like children, stroking their feathers and misting their beaks with water. “If a person is neglecting their bird, it’s a huge problem,” said Hamad Al Mehshadi, a falcon festival manager taking his raptor for a regular medical checkup. “When one holds onto their bird, it is something else. The love of the bird is extraordinary.” Oil wealth and global business may have transformed Doha into a futuristic capital with a gleaming array of skyscrapers and megaprojects, including giant stadiums soon to host millions of soccer fans for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup. But Souq Waqif still sees a steady stream of 150 falcons a day — a sign that the echoes of Qatar’s ancient past are not lost. “Even the look that a falcon and its owner share, it’s different than any other look,” Al Karkhi said. Falconers “feel the loyalty of this bird — a fierce warrior in the wild and yet a pet in my hand.” ___ Follow Lujain Jo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/lujainjo."

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,328 Million-Year-Old Vampire Squid Ancestor Named After Biden 'As A Compliment',environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost President Joe Biden has a new namesake: an ancient, soft-bodied cephalopod that had 10 suction-cupped arms and was likely the ancestor of the modern octopus and vampire squid. The 328-million-year-old fossil, named Syllipsimopodi bideni (“Syllipsimopodi” means “prehensile foot”), was described in a paper published in Nature Communications earlier this month. The fossil was first found in Montana in 1988 and donated to Canada’s Royal Ontario Museum. It was then more or less ignored until Christopher Whalen, a paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History, started looking at it under a microscope, The New York Times reported. The fossil turned out to be “an exceptionally well-preserved vampyropod,” Whalen and fellow AMNH paleontologist Neil Landman wrote in their paper. Vampyropods include octopuses and vampire squid (which are not actually squid). Scientists believe that Syllipsimopodi bideni is the oldest known ancestor of such animals. Contemporary octopuses famously have eight arms, as do vampire squid ― though vampire squid additionally have two long filaments that help them feed. The new discovery suggests that both animals evolved from an ancestor that had 10 arms, two of which went away over the course of evolution. “This fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed 10 arms,” Whalen said in a statement from AMNH. But it was largely the ocean creature’s name that’s garnered headlines over the past month. The researchers who described the fossil have emphasized they meant it in a nice way. “It was intended as a compliment,” Whalen told the New Haven Register this week. “We liked the plans he put forward to address climate change and fund science, so it seemed like a nice way to sort of bring attention to those policies,” Whalen said. He added that they had submitted the paper around the time of the Capitol riots in 2021 and “felt like it would be a good time to say something, even in a small way, that was positive about the start of Biden’s presidency rather than negative.” As The Washington Post noted, it’s pretty common for new species to be named after presidents. A moth and a blind, limbless amphibian were both named after Donald Trump. There were at least nine different creatures named after Barack Obama, including two parasites (this was also apparently meant as an honor). One scientist said at the time that he named a newly discovered parasitic flatworm after Obama in part because both the former president and the flatworm were “cool as hell.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
11,Louisiana Digging Out After Tornadoes Plow Through Homes,environment," ARABI, La. (AP) — Residents in the New Orleans area were digging out and assessing damage Wednesday after tornadoes lashed the region, flipping vehicles, ripping off rooftops and depositing a house with a family inside in the middle of their street. Other tornadoes spawned by the same system caused so much damage in Texas  that the governor declared a disaster in 16 counties. Buildings were shredded in Alabama, where torrential rainfall was recorded. Two people were killed and multiple others were injured as the storm front blew across the South. The dead included a woman north of Dallas and a person in St. Bernard Parish, next to New Orleans. Authorities didn’t immediately describe how they were killed. Planning to fly over damaged areas later Wednesday, Gov. John Bel Edwards declared an emergency in St. Bernard, Orleans, Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes. There were “no injuries, casualties or significant damage reported in Orleans Parish,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Wednesday, but tornadoes touched down in Arabi, just east of the city, and further east in Lacombe, across Lake Pontchartrain. In Arabi, debris hung from electrical wires and trees amid destroyed houses. Power poles were down, forcing emergency workers to walk slowly through darkened neighborhoods checking for damage early Wednesday. “I wasn’t mentally prepared to see what I was seeing,” said Amy Sims, who jumped into her car when the tornado warning sounded and drove to the Arabi Heights area to check on relatives. She said emergency medics, some crying, were dodging live wires as they went door-to-door through shattered homes. “A bomb looked like it had gone off,” she said, adding that her cousin’s home and family were OK, but houses all around them were flattened. The National Weather Service said the Arabi damage had been caused by a tornado of at least EF-3 strength, meaning it had winds of 158-206 mph (254-332 km/h), while the Lacombe-area twister was an EF-1, with winds as strong as 90 mph (145 km/h). Television stations broadcast live images as the storm damaged an area about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) long and a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) wide in St. Bernard Parish, where Ochsner Health said eight patients were treated in an emergency department. Collin Arnold, director of homeland security and emergency preparedness in neighboring New Orleans, described “incredible devastation” in Arabi, where he said a state team including fire, EMS and police officers from across Louisiana was doing searches and damage assessments. Louisiana activated 300 National Guard personnel to clear roads and provide support. They joined firefighters and others searching door-to-door to make sure no one had been left behind, said John Rahaim Jr., the parish’s homeland security director. Residents of severely damaged or destroyed homes in Arabi swept up broken glass and tried to salvage their belongings. The community next to the city’s Lower 9th Ward was wrecked by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and hit hard again when Hurricane Ida swept through last year. Stacey Mancuso’s family had just finished repairing the damage from Ida, which ripped off the roof and caused extensive water damage. Huddling in the laundry room with her husband, two children and dogs, they all survived as the tornado blew away part of their new roof. “We’re alive. That’s what I can say at this point,” said Mancuso. Still, the twister was the third time they’ve had major weather damage since Katrina. Entergy reported that about 3,700 of its customers remained without electricity Wednesday. A strong smell of natural gas was in the air, and downed power lines forced emergency workers to walk slowly through the wreckage. Michelle Malasovich was texting relatives from her home in Arabi when “all of a sudden the lights started flickering.” Her husband saw the twister approaching. “It just kept getting louder and louder,” Malasovich said. After it passed, they saw some columns were blown off their porch, and her Jeep’s windows were blown out. Others fared worse: “Our neighbor’s house is in the middle of the street right now.” The couple inside that home emerged from the wreckage seeking help to rescue their daughter, who was on a breathing machine and trapped inside, neighbors and authorities said. “A young girl was on a ventilator, her father was looking for firefighters to come help,” St. Bernard Parish President Guy McInnis said. “And they were already in there taking care of the young lady and she’s doing fine.” Gene Katz said he, his wife and their two children hid in a closet as the tornado pushed their home off its slab and caved in the part where they took shelter. “By the time we closed the door, the roof came off, and that was it,” he said. As the storm front moved eastward, an apparent twister shredded a metal building and shattered windows east of Mobile Bay. The weather service reported more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rainfall in the central Alabama city of Sylacauga overnight. The roofs of several homes were damaged in Toxey, Alabama, where tornado warnings were issued. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said a dozen counties had damage to homes and two injuries were reported. The vicious weather hit Texas on Monday, with several tornadoes reported along the Interstate 35 corridor. In Elgin, broken trees lined the rural roads and pieces of metal hung from the branches as residents stepped gingerly through the mess. J.D. Harkins, 59, said he saw two tornadoes pass by his Elgin home. “There used to be a barn there,” Harkins said, pointing to an empty plot on his uncle’s property, covered with debris. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said 10 people were injured by storms in the Crockett area, while more than a dozen were reportedly hurt elsewhere. The Grayson County Emergency Management Office said a 73-year-old woman was killed in Sherwood Shores, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of Dallas, but provided no details. ___ Associated Press journalists Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina; Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama; Kimberly Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; Ken Miller in Oklahoma City; Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas; Terry Wallace in Dallas; Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans; and Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report."
12,Girl Survives Tornado That Lifted House Through The Air And Dropped It On Another Street,environment," ARABI, Louisiana (AP) — The tornado that ripped through a New Orleans suburb lifted one house into the air and dropped it onto the middle of a street with a family inside. Neighbors said the parents of a girl climbed out of the wreckage screaming frantically for help. Their daughter was on a breathing machine, and now was stuck inside. Chuck Heirsch told The Times-Picayune / New Orleans Advocate that he called 911 as he saw his neighbor on Prosperity Street trying to reach his daughter. “They were screaming. His wife was hysterical. They were already traumatized from taking that ‘Wizard of Oz’ ride,” Heirsch said. “All the men in the neighborhood ran to the house. The mother, they brought her to me. I just held her,” Nerissa Ledet told the newspaper. “I tried to console her. I said, ‘You know they’re going to get her out.’” Firefighters quickly arrived and carried her out in a blanket. St. Bernard Parish President Guy McInnis described the rescue, saying she’s in a hospital and “doing fine.”"
13,View To A Kill: Humans Interrupt Cheetah's Impala Hunt And People Are Mad,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The fascinating spectacle of a cheetah hunting an impala turned infuriating when rule-breaking tourists interfered. (Watch the video below.) In video posted Tuesday by Latest Sightings from South Africa’s Kruger National Park, the quick cat singled out its prey in an impala herd and chased it into a spectator’s BMW, according to the YouTube post. Many people hung out of their parked cars to view the action, violating the park’s rules and apparently spooking the cheetah. The big cat retreated to the bush as the impala lay stunned next to the car, but eventually slinked back to drag the impala away. Some who watched the footage, which was shot by Hardus Lubbe, Petrus de Kock and Thabane Malatji, expressed dismay at the encroachment of visitors. “Extremely unethical from an animal stewardship perspective,” one commenter wrote on YouTube. “Why on earth were so many cars permitted to enter into such a small area of the park?” “Both prey and predators were affected by the congested traffic and human noise,” another complained. Sarah Oxley, the project administrator for Latest Sightings, which posts wildlife videos from Kruger National Park, told HuffPost Wednesday “it is quite sad to see that many visitors breaking the rules.” “Because the sighting happened near Crocodile Bridge a popular entry point into the park, the traffic built up really quickly and that is why there are so many people at the sighting,” Oxley added.

14,Trump Still Can't Wrap Head Around Climate Change: 'You Have A Thing Called Weather',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump clearly hasn’t been studying up on climate change since his stint in the Oval Office. The observation he offered in a Fox Business interview Monday is that “you have a thing called weather.” Trump pushed his “weather” theory when host Stuart Varney asked him if thought “human activity” — such as the burning of fossil fuels — is responsible for climate change. “In my opinion, you have a thing called weather,” Trump responded. “And you go up and you go down.” He added: “If you look into the 1920s, they were talking about global freezing. OK? In other words, the globe was going to freeze. And then they go global warming, and then they couldn’t use that because the temperatures were actually quite cool, and it’s many different things ... the climate’s always been changing.” (Last week, Trump laughed that a rise in sea levels as the polar ice caps melt just means “more oceanfront property.”) So that’s apparently a no on human activity. Also in the interview, Trump accused President Joe Biden of perpetrating a climate change “hoax” to avoid increasing oil production. There were no claims of “global freezing” in the 1920s, as Trump claims, though some scientists hypothesized, in largely discredited findings, that world temperatures declined from 1945 to 1972. In any case, any natural trend toward another ice age was interrupted by the “massive influence” of the burgeoning burning of fossil fuels, scientists have noted. On other issues, Trump insisted in the Fox Business interview that this year’s midterm elections and the 2024 elections should focus on his lies that the 2020 presidential vote was rigged against him, because that would be “good for me.” Varney can barely believe it when Trump claims the 2022 and 2024 elections should mainly be about how he was ""cheated"" in 2020 pic.twitter.com/P2YTgvrymu Check out Trump’s climate change observations in the video clip up top.

15,"1.5 Degrees Celsius Climate Goal Is 'On Life Support,' UN Chief Warns",environment," Reporter, HuffPost The world’s goal of stopping the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius will soon become unattainable, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a grim warning Monday. “We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,” Guterres told an audience at the Economist Sustainability Summit in London. “The 1.5-degree goal is on life support. It is in intensive care.” “There is no kind way to put it,” he said. Guterres’ remarks come six years after 196 countries agreed to an international treaty on climate change called the Paris Agreement. In order to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, the nations agreed that they would all commit to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, cutting the world’s output in half by 2030 and reaching a net-zero output by 2050. The most ambitious goal of the treaty was to keep further global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Surpassing that threshold, climate scientists say, would lead to irreversible damage to the planet and humanity with an array of disasters: sea-level rise, flooding, hurricanes, heat waves, drought, wildfires, famine, disease and overall ecosystem destruction. But even with the agreement in place, experts say countries have not acted quickly enough. “The problem is getting worse. If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5 goodbye. Even 2 degrees may be out of reach,” Guterres said Monday. The secretary-general’s comments mirror the results of a U.N. climate report released last month, showing that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than past U.N. assessments. Global carbon emissions hit a record high in 2019 before dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic as economies around the world went into hibernation in 2020. But emissions bounced back with a vengeance last year. “According to present national commitments, global emissions are set to increase by almost 14% in the 2020s,” Guterres said. “Last year alone, global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 6% to their highest levels in history. Coal emissions have surged to record highs.” Wealthy countries with big carbon footprints are not taking enough action to move away from fossil fuels, he added. The United States is one of the world’s biggest polluters, but politicization of the issue has made it difficult for President Joe Biden to carry out the necessary steps that his predecessor, Donald Trump, refused to take. Deadlock in Congress has stopped the Biden administration from renewing a $2 trillion package that includes $300 billion in tax credits for wind, solar and nuclear energy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also throws a wrench into the matter. While experts say cutting off reliance on Russian oil imports may spur countries to invest more in renewable resources, the conflict could also make climate spending less of a priority as countries beef up military spending.

0,Vicious Alaska Storm Knocks 6 Mushers Out Of Iditarod Dog Sled Race,environment," ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Three additional mushers running at the back of the pack have scratched from this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race after accepting assistance during a massive ground storm. The vicious Friday storm forced six mushers in total to scratch after they sought help in the storm that packed high winds. Two of those mushers needed a rescue off the trial just miles from the end of the nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska. Race marshal Mark Nordman was informed late Friday that Sebastien Dos Santos Borges, a rookie from Chazey-Bons, France, and KattiJo and Jeff Deeter, a married couple from Fairbanks running separate dog teams, accepted help and had scratched, said a Saturday afternoon statement from race officials. Dos Santos Borges and the Deeters all accepted assistance between the checkpoints of White Mountain and Safety, which is just 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the finish line in Nome. A White Mountain search and rescue team on snowmobiles assisted the mushers to a Nome Kennel Club shelter cabin, where they rode out the storm. When conditions improved, Iditarod volunteers were able to assist getting the three and their dog teams to Nome, where the dogs will be checked by veterinarians. All three mushers were in contact with Nordman while they were at the shelter cabin, and reported their teams were in good health. Earlier Friday, two mushers had to be rescued, and a third scratched after receiving assistance back to a checkpoint. Rookie Gerhardt Thiart, a native of South Africa now living in Cheboygan, Michigan, activated his emergency beacon because of the storm and a leg injury. A passerby on a snowmobile happened upon him and took him to White Mountain. He was eventually flown to Nome for evaluation of his injury. Musher Bridgett Watkins of Fairbanks was able to contact family in Nome for help. Independent of that call, her husband Scotty had left Nome with others on snowmobiles to assist mushers in the storm and he located her. She was taken to the clinic in White Mountain for evaluation and eventually flown to Nome, 77 miles (124 kilometers) away. Another musher, rookie Sean Williams of Chugiak, also scratched late Friday after receiving assistance back to White Mountain from someone on a snowmobile. The world’s most famous sled dog race started for 49 mushers March 6 north of Anchorage. The trail took them over two mountain ranges, along the frozen Yukon River and then along the Bering Sea ice on Alaska’s western coast. Since then, 12 mushers have scratched, half of them on Friday. Brent Sass of Eureka won the race Tuesday. He had his own bad weather encounter just a few miles from the finish line in high winds blowing off the Bering Sea. He fell off his sled and lost the trail. He thought he was going to have to hunker down, stopping with his dogs to wait until the weather improved. “I couldn’t see anything,” he said in a post-race interview. “The dogs, the only reason we got out of there is because they trusted me to get them back to the trail. And once we got back to the trail, they just took off a hundred miles an hour again, and we were able to stay on the trail and get in here. It was a lot of work,” he said. There were still four mushers on the trail Saturday evening, making their way from White Mountain to safety."
1,5.3 Million Chickens Will Be Killed In Iowa Over Bird Flu Outbreak,environment," DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The confirmation of bird flu at another Iowa egg-laying farm will force the killing of more than 5 million chickens, state officials said Friday. It’s the second confirmed case of avian influenza in Buena Vista County, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) northwest of Des Moines, but the latest outbreak is at an operation with 5.3 million chickens. The earlier case was at a farm with about 50,000 turkeys. The latest case confirmed by the state Department of Agriculture means nearly 12.6 million chicken and turkeys in at least eight states have been killed or will be destroyed soon. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 24 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year. The first Iowa case was identified on March 1 in a backyard flock of 42 ducks and geese in Pottawattamie County in western Iowa. Another egg-laying chicken farm with nearly 916,000 birds was reported with the virus on March 10 in Taylor County in southwest Iowa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products. Cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F kills bacteria and viruses."
2,"Texas Firefighters Battle Wildfires That Have Killed 1, Burned 50 Homes",environment," EASTLAND, Texas (AP) — Fire crews in Texas hope to make progress Saturday against a massive complex of wildfires that have killed one person and burned at least 50 homes, officials said. Winds were expected to diminish on Saturday, raising hopes for the attack on the flames, said Angel Lopez, a spokesman for the task force attacking the wildfire complex near Eastland, about 120 miles west of Dallas. However, gusty winds were expected to return Sunday, again raising the wildfire threat to critical levels in western and central Texas, he said. At a news conference in Eastland, Gov. Greg Abbott said late Friday that at least 50 homes had been destroyed by flames with more possibly to be found. He declared a disaster in the 11 counties hardest hit by wildfires. The Texas A&M Forest Services warned that fires could also affect parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, and Nebraska warned of an extreme fire risk. The Eastland County Sheriff’s Office released more details on the death of Deputy Sgt. Barbara Fenley. In a statement, the office said she was going door to door, getting residents to evacuate their homes Thursday and it was “last heard that she was going to check on an elderly individual.” “With the extreme deteriorating conditions and low visibility from smoke, Sgt. Fenley ran off the roadway and was engulfed in the fire,” the sheriff’s statement said. As of Friday afternoon, the fires had burned about 130 square miles (330 square kilometers), about 70 square miles (185 square kilometers) in the Eastland Complex alone, according to Texas A&M Forest Service. The fires in that complex were only 4% contained late Friday, with fires burning in thick brush and grass fields. About 18,000 people live in Eastland County. About 475 homes were evacuated in the town of Gorman, said Matthew Ford, spokesman for Texas A&M Forest Service. Several months of dry, windy weather have fueled deadly wildfires in Kansas  and Oklahoma, including one a few weeks ago. In remote, western Nebraska ranching country, a large wildfire has been burning for several days. Meteorologists said they were hopeful that rain showers expected early next week across the Plains would reduce the risk. “We’ve been so dry that even an inch of rain would make a difference,” said Robb Lawson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Wichita, Kansas. Smaller fires were burning in other parts of Texas, and Thursday’s low humidity and high winds created an ideal scenario for the blazes to quickly grow out of control. Texas A&M Forest Service had warned of a wildfire outbreak this week because of the forecast. The fires caused hazy conditions hundreds of miles away, with the Houston Fire Department and the city’s Office of Emergency Management on Friday morning sending out automated phone messages alerting area residents to smoke and ash."
3,"Arctic, Antarctica See Freakish Extreme Heat At Same Time",environment," Earth’s poles are undergoing simultaneous freakish extreme heat with parts of Antarctica more than 70 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 50 degrees (30 degrees Celsius) warmer than average. Weather stations in Antarctica shattered records Friday as the region neared autumn. The two-mile high (3,234 meters) Concordia station was at 10 degrees (-12.2 degrees Celsius),which is about 70 degrees warmer than average, while the even higher Vostok station hit a shade above 0 degrees (-17.7 degrees Celsius), beating its all-time record by about 27 degrees (15 degrees Celsius), according to a tweet from extreme weather record tracker Maximiliano Herrera. The coastal Terra Nova Base was far above freezing at 44.6 degrees (7 degrees Celsius). It caught officials at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, by surprise because they were paying attention to the Arctic where it was 50 degrees warmer than average and areas around the North Pole were nearing or at the melting point, which is really unusual for mid-March, said center ice scientist Walt Meier. “They are opposite seasons. You don’t see the north and the south (poles) both melting at the same time,” Meier told The Associated Press Friday evening. “It’s definitely an unusual occurrence.” “It’s pretty stunning,” Meier added. “Wow. I have never seen anything like this in the Antarctic,” said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who returned recently from an expedition to the continent. “Not a good sign when you see that sort of thing happen,” said University of Wisconsin meteorologist Matthew Lazzara. Lazzara monitors temperatures at East Antarctica’s Dome C-ii and logged 14 degrees (-10 degrees Celsius) Friday, where the normal is -45 degrees (-43 degrees Celsius): “That’s a temperature that you should see in January, not March. January is summer there. That’s dramatic.” Both Lazzara and Meier said what happened in Antarctica is probably just a random weather event and not a sign of climate change. But if it happens again or repeatedly then it might be something to worry about and part of global warming, they said. The Antarctic warm spell was first reported by The Washington Post. The Antarctic continent as a whole on Friday was about 8.6 degrees (4.8 degrees Celsius) warmer than a baseline temperature between 1979 and 2000, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, based on U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration weather models. That 8-degree heating over an already warmed-up average is unusual, think of it as if the entire United States was 8 degrees hotter than normal, Meier said. At the same time, on Friday the Arctic as a whole was 6 degrees (3.3 degrees) warmer than the 1979 to 2000 average. By comparison, the world as a whole was only 1.1 degrees (0.6 degrees Celsius) above the 1979 to 2000 average. Globally the 1979 to 2000 average is about half a degree (.3 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average. What makes the Antarctic warming really weird is that the southern continent — except for its vulnerable peninsula which is warming quickly and losing ice rapidly — has not been warming much, especially when compared to the rest of the globe, Meier said. Antarctica did set a record for the lowest summer sea ice — records go back to 1979 — with it shrinking to 741,000 square miles (1.9 million square kilometers) in late February, the snow and ice data center reported. What likely happened was “a big atmospheric river” pumped in warm and moist air from the Pacific southward, Meier said. And in the Arctic, which has been warming two to three times faster than the rest of the globe and is considered vulnerable to climate change, warm Atlantic air was coming north off the coast of Greenland."
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

11,EPA Union Urges Agency To Scrap Trump-Era Plan To Relocate Houston Lab,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Federal workers at the Environmental Protection Agency are fighting to keep a key laboratory in Houston, warning that following through on a Trump-era plan to relocate the facility to rural Oklahoma would force out dedicated staff and harm heavily polluted industrial communities along the Gulf Coast. The American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing federal workers, including more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan on Thursday urging him to reverse course on the Region 6 lab. “The closing of the Lab in Houston — the petrochemical corridor of the world, with its high concentration of chemical plants and refineries — is counterproductive to EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment” and would be “a step backwards in your commitment to serve environmental justice communities in the Gulf Coast area,” AFGE President Everett Kelley writes in the letter. AFGE provided Regan with a petition signed by more than 2,400 people opposing the planned relocation of the lab from Houston to Ada, Oklahoma, approximately 400 miles north. “In an attempt to save money, they are hurting the science,” said a longtime Houston lab employee, who requested anonymity over fear of retaliation. “We have a new administration now and they need to be made aware of these problems, because they’ve inherited this mess. These decisions were made during the last administration in an attempt to shrink the EPA.” The employee added that the situation has tanked morale at the Houston facility and that they anticipate many staffers will opt not to make the move. The Houston lab serves all of Region 6 — Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. It conducts air, water and soil testing at hazardous waste sites and in the wake of environmental disasters, such as hurricanes and oil spills. The relocation, on track to be finalized next year, is part of a series of EPA lab closures and consolidations that the Trump administration advanced beginning in 2017. Notably, former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is from Oklahoma and previously served as the state’s attorney general. So far, the Biden administration has pressed ahead with plans to shutter the Houston facility, maintaining that doing so will cut costs. “As a result of this co-location, EPA expects to save $1.8 million annually in lease and facility expenses and reduce agency lab space by approximately 41,000 square feet,” reads the EPA’s FY 2021 budget justification document. But other EPA lab relocations have been plagued by delays and unanticipated costs, the agency’s internal watchdog concluded in a 2020 report. Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokesperson, told HuffPost that the location change “will not alter the Lab’s service capabilities” and that the agency will retain staff in Houston to handle emergency response, inspections and enforcement. “EPA takes seriously the concerns of its workers and values their input,” she wrote in an email response. “In keeping with this commitment, we work to ensure full transparency into decision-making that affects their working conditions and lives. The agency is following the direction set forth by Congress for more than 10 years to reduce its federal footprint to be more efficient and effective with taxpayer dollars.” “The agency will be fully able to meet our commitment to serving communities in the Gulf Coast area,” she added. The Trump administration did not hide its motivation for relocating federal workers. Relocations are “a wonderful way to sort of streamline government,” former President Donald Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a 2019 Republican gala in South Carolina, referring to the decision to uproot D.C.-based Agriculture Department employees and move them to the Kansas City area. “It’s really, really hard to drain the swamp, but we’re working at it.” The approach worked. When the Trump administration moved the Bureau of Land Management headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction, Colorado, for example, it resulted in nearly 300 employees resigning or taking early retirement. The Biden administration has since relocated BLM headquarters back to D.C. In its letter to Regan, AFGE stressed that the Biden administration has an opportunity to “rectify misguided decisions by the Trump Administration … to undercut the mission and day-to-day work of dedicated EPA employees.” “While the Obama Administration studied potential efficiencies from downscaling Federal offices, it was the Trump administration that acted on them in this case, sidelining overarching goals to invest in environmental justice, enforcement, and inspections,” the letter states. “Your administration has a chance for you to undo these harms, and we encourage you to take it.” Read the full letter below: Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Dr. Oz's First-Class Flip-Flop On Fracking,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV surgeon better known as Dr. Oz, used to write and tweet about the health benefits of coconut oil, lavender oil, CBD oil, MCT oil, avocado and olive oil. He also appeared to be a strong opponent of fracking, warning his readers in multiple articles about the potential health risks associated with one of the more controversial fossil fuel extracting technologies. Hydraulic fracturing, better known as “fracking,” involves pumping a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to release oil and natural gas. In 2014, an Ohio man asked Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, then the chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, whether it was true that fracking is polluting air and groundwater and threatening public health. Oz and Roizen replied that it was “a fact” that the process pumps “toxic chemicals” deep into the ground. “We wonder how eager the leaders of the natural gas industry would be to drink well water from a farm next to one of their drilling sites,” Oz and Roizen wrote in a health and wellness Q&A, adding that in Pennsylvania, “there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting.” But now that Oz is a GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, he is apparently less concerned about fracking’s possible health effects on his potential constituents and more interested in preserving an industry active in the state. “Back off Biden! Give us freedom to frack!” Oz said Wednesday in a rambling TikTok video while pumping gas somewhere in the Keystone State. Back off Biden and give us the freedom to Frack! pic.twitter.com/XkIE6qV4R0 Oz’s campaign is even denying that he ever voiced any concern about fracking in the first place, claiming that he had no part in any of those earlier columns — even though he is listed as their primary author. That denial calls into question which of Oz’s medical advice columns he actually stands behind and raises questions about his brand as a trusted health professional. Oz has joined the chorus of Republican voices citing Russia’s war in Ukraine to demand President Joe Biden “unleash” American oil and gas production. His Twitter feed is a spitting image of those of many fossil fuel industry-backed GOP lawmakers in recent weeks. Permits mean nothing if Biden refuses to provide certainty that our energy producers' investments will be able to continue. Give us the freedom to frack. pic.twitter.com/ArdXPXqFp1 Oz’s promotion of fracking stands in stark contrast to the position he apparently held before running for public office. In January 2015, he and Roizen also co-authored a piece in right-wing news outlet Newsmax titled, “Surprise! Fracking May Cause Birth Defects.” In it, they cited a study from the University of Missouri-Columbia that they noted “determined that for 15 million Americans living within one mile of sites for fracking sites … exposure to the chemicals released ‘may be harmful to human health’ and ‘can result in adverse reproductive health and developmental defects.’” The two also called for legislation that “requires anyone who profits from a fracking site to drink the local water.” In a second piece in Newsmax in December 2015, Oz and Roizen slammed the lack of accountability surrounding chemicals used by the fracking industry. “Believe it or not, when chemicals under immense pressure are injected into the ground during hydraulic fracturing, no one is currently held accountable for the amount and/or type of chemicals being used,” they wrote. Oz and Roizen threw their support behind an American Medical Association initiative calling for the disclosure and monitoring of fracking chemicals to better protect human health, and encouraged readers living near fracking wells to “get a good water filter now.” To say Oz’s views on fracking have morphed would be an understatement. He has done a complete 180 on the issue, even though environmental and public health concerns about the practice persist and a recent poll found that the majority of Pennsylvania residents — 55% — oppose fracking and want to see it brought to an end. An Environmental Protection Agency study in 2016 concluded that such fracking activities “can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.” Oz’s campaign, however, claims his past position on fracking wasn’t really his at all. A spokesperson claimed that the views in their shared columns belonged entirely to Roizen, even though Oz’s name appeared in the byline. “Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen have very different positions on energy policy and fracking,” Brittany Yanick, the campaign’s communications director, told HuffPost. “Dr. Roizen took over sole management of the daily column in 2009 and when they disagreed on views, he was supposed to clearly specify he felt a different way than Dr. Oz — these are clear examples that he didn’t do that.” Yanick provided HuffPost with a letter that Roizen signed eight days before Oz announced his Senate bid. In it, Roizen wrote, “When Dr. Oz shifted his focus to launch his show in 2009, I took over the sole management of his daily column. When controversial topics arose, we were supposed to debate options. If we disagreed on an editorial direction, I would specify that ‘Dr. Roizen’ felt a certain way. We have found several columns where this process was not followed. I write to ensure that our agreement is part of the public record.” The campaign’s argument raises the question of whether there are other medical advice columns published in 2009 or later that Oz also doesn’t stand behind — columns that had no disclaimer and therefore led readers to believe Oz backed them. Roizen did not return a phone call on Thursday. Yanick told HuffPost that Oz “has always supported hydraulic fracturing and a strong domestic energy industry.” The campaign provided HuffPost with 10 different comments Oz has made voicing that support — yet all of them were from 2022. Yanick did not respond when HuffPost asked if there are examples that predate his bid for Senate. Oz is campaigning on a pledge to “fight back against heavy-handed regulations and protect the PA energy industry!” More specifically, he’s going to bat for frackers, arguing that the technology is effective and safe. Pennsylvania is a leader in the production of coal and natural gas. As the next US Senator from PA, I will fight back against heavy-handed regulations and protect the PA energy industry! “Fracking is something I’ve looked at very carefully,” he said on Sean Hannity’s radio show in December 2021. “You can spread all kinds of rumors about fracking, but it works. It seems to be able to do things that otherwise we wouldn’t be able to do and keeping ourselves energy independent.” Oz has even criticized people who’ve raised environmental and human health concerns about the practice — something that the articles attributed to him actually did. In a February interview with The Dom Giordano Program, Oz said Pennsylvanians are “angry” that “corporate elitists” have “aided and abetted by not allowing smart energy policy to thrive, because they’ve had to go along to get along.” “They allowed green energy ideologists to argue that anything having to do with natural gas, for example, is bad for the environment, bad for humanity, and can’t occur,” he said. Oz added that natural gas is the “right” choice scientifically and medically. “As a doctor, and as an outsider, I can say that natural gas is a much faster way for us to keep the planet safe than most of the other ideas, like buying Teslas,” he said. While it is true that the U.S. fracking boom helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing coal-fired electricity, natural gas is not the “clean” fuel the industry claims it is. A 2019 report, for example, concluded that new oil and gas drilling, which relies heavily on hydraulic fracturing, would generate planet-warming pollutants equivalent to 1,000 new coal plants. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas that accounts for one-third of all human-caused planetary warming. And methane leaks are pervasive across the oil and gas sector. Oz’s flip-flop on fracking highlights the Republican Party’s allegiance to a fossil fuel industry that is the primary driver of global climate change. Along with cheerleading for fracking, the GOP candidate has adopted all of his party’s talking points to blame Biden for high gas prices and Russia’s violent invasion of Ukraine. If history is any guide, his rhetoric is all but certain to pay off in the form of industry campaign donations.

13,California Man Pleads Guilty To Taking 2 Baby Bears From Their Den,environment," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California man who admitted to taking two bear cubs from their den and notified officials after he was unable to care for them pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited species, wildlife officials said. Cody Dylon Setzer, 29, and a co-worker who has not been identified and cooperated with authorities took the month-old bears from their den in a tree that had fallen across a forest road, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said Tuesday. Setzer contacted wildlife officers on March 9, 2019, and told them he had found the baby bears along Highway 263 north of Yreka in Siskiyou County, the department said. But wildlife officers became suspicious of his story after they went out to the site and found no bear tracks or habitat. “Bear cubs are 100% dependent upon the sow and if they had been wondering on their own they wouldn’t have survived,” said Capt. Patrick Foy of the department’s law enforcement division. Setzer’s co-worker at a timber management company confessed to wildlife offices and cooperated with the investigation, Foy said. “The other person literally brought them back to the den site,” he said. The den site was located east of Salt Creek and Interstate 5 in Shasta County, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of where Setzer said he had found them and had been destroyed. Their mother was never located, Foy said. The bear cubs were taken to CDFW’s Wildlife Health Laboratory in Rancho Cordova and later turned over for rehabilitation to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, which said they were the youngest ever brought into its facility. The cubs were returned to their native habitat in Shasta County on April 28, 2020, after growing old enough to survive on their own, the department said. The department published the story Tuesday on its blog about bears to encourage anyone who may witness wildlife poaching to contact authorities. In November, Setzer pleaded guilty in Siskiyou Superior Court to possession of a prohibited species and obstructing a peace officer in the course of his duties. He was ordered to pay $2,290 in fines and fees and complete 200 hours of community service. Setzer was also placed on probation for 12 months with his hunting and fishing privileges suspended for the duration of his probation, and sentenced to 90 days in the county jail, which will be stayed if he successfully completes probation, the department said."
14,Deep-Sea Octopuses Are Making Shelters Out Of Human Trash,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost One man’s trash is an octopus’ treasure. A group of researchers from Italy and Brazil wanted to take a closer at how deep-sea octopuses interact with trash that makes its way to the ocean after being discarded by humans. While the eight-armed creatures have been photographed with litter for years ― doing things like hiding inside bottles or carrying around halves of discarded coconut shells ― there hasn’t been a lot of scientific research about the phenomenon, the scientists wrote in a paper published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin last month. For their own study, the researchers crowdsourced 261 images taken by divers that show ocean floor-dwelling octopuses interacting with trash all over the world. They then used those images to help them determine exactly what octopuses do with human garbage. “The deep-sea records were extremely interesting, because even at great depths these animals are interacting with the litter,” Maira Proietti at the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil, who supervised the research, told The Guardian. The primary way octopuses appeared to use litter was for shelter, like hiding inside a bottle. Glass containers were what they most frequently used, followed by plastic and then metal ones. They also used smaller pieces of trash in other ways, the researchers noted, repurposing objects like “metal and plastic caps/lids, glass and plasticfragments, a metal spoon, and coconut shells as camouflage,” or making use of bigger items like cans, plastic bags and even part of a surfboard to help them hide between rocks. While this ingenuity demonstrates the cephalopods’ intelligence and “extreme ability to adapt,” Proietti stressed that “it is not a good thing to think that the animals may be using litter as shelter because the seashells are gone.” And some of the octopuses’ behavior could be dangerous for them, like using broken glass for shelter. Proietti told the CBC that one octopus was photographed sheltering inside a car battery, which could be giving off harmful chemicals. The researchers acknowledged that their study had some limitations. For example, it appeared that the number of photos of octopuses with trash was increasing over time. But it’s not clear if this was because of more trash in the ocean, or due to digital and underwater photography becoming cheaper and more accessible, meaning that more divers would be taking photos. But they see their analysis as a jumping-off point for more research to be done on the subject. “It is possible that the negative impacts of litter on octopuses is underestimated due to the lack of available data, and we therefore emphasize that the problem must be more thoroughly assessed,” they wrote in the paper.

15,"Endangered Rhino Born In Czech Zoo, Named Kyiv",environment," PRAGUE (AP) — A Czech zoo has welcomed a critically endangered eastern black rhinoceros baby that has taken the name of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in honor of that country’s resistance to invading Russian forces. The rhino was born early on March 4 in the Dvur Kralove zoo, a rare occurrence for the facility even if it has the most rhinos belonging to the subspecies. “The name is another expression of our support for the Ukrainian heroes,“ zoo Director Premysl Rabas said. Kyiv’s mother Eva has been taking care of him in a best possible way, the zoo said, with the baby gaining 1 kilogram (2.20 pounds) a day. It currently weighs about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) . Poaching has reduced the number of the eastern black rhinos living in the wild to around 800. The Czech park has 14. Only three other such rhinos have been born in other zoos around the world in the last year. A total of 47 eastern black rhinos have been born in Dvur Kralove since the park received the first one in 1971. Many of them are now in various zoos around the globe but nine have been returned to Rwanda and Tanzania to live in the wild."

Lake Powell’s fall to below 3,525 feet (1,075 meters) puts it at its lowest level since the lake filled after the federal government dammed the Colorado River at Glen Canyon more than a half century ago — a record marking yet another sobering realization of the impacts of climate change and megadrought. It comes as hotter temperatures and less precipitation leave a smaller amount flowing through the over-tapped Colorado River. Though water scarcity is hardly new in the region, hydropower concerns at Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona reflect that a future western states assumed was years away is approaching — and fast. “We clearly weren’t sufficiently prepared for the need to move this quickly,” said John Fleck, director of the University of New Mexico’s Water Resources Program. Federal officials are confident water levels will rise in the coming months once snow melts in the Rockies. But they warn that more may need to be done to ensure Glen Canyon Dam can keep producing hydropower in the years ahead. “Spring runoff will resolve the deficit in the short term,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water and power in more than a dozen states. “However, our work is not done.” Though both Lake Powell and its downstream counterpart,  Lake Mead, are dropping faster than expected, much of the region’s focus has been on how to deal with water scarcity in Arizona, Nevada and California, not electricity supply. For Glen Canyon Dam, the new level is 35 feet (11 meters) above what’s considered “minimum power pool” — the level at which its turbines would stop producing hydroelectric power. If Lake Powell drops even more, it could soon hit “deadpool” — the point at which water likely would fail to flow through the dam and onto Lake Mead. Arizona, Nevada, California, and Mexico already are taking a combination of mandatory and voluntary cuts tied to Lake Mead’s levels. About 5 million customers in seven states — Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — buy power generated at Glen Canyon Dam. The government provides it at a cheaper rate than energy sold on the wholesale market, which can be wind, solar, coal or natural gas. For the cities, rural electric cooperatives and tribes that rely on its hydropower, less water flowing through Glen Canyon Dam can therefore increase total energy costs. Customers bear the brunt. The situation worries the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, one of the 50 tribal suppliers that rely on the dam for hydropower. It plans to spend $4.5 million on an alternative energy supply this year. “It’s a very sensitive issue for all of us right now,” said Walter Haase, the tribal utility’s general manager. Bureau of Reclamation officials last summer took an unprecedented step and diverted water from reservoirs in Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado in what they called “emergency releases” to replenish Lake Powell. In January, the agency also held back water scheduled to be released through the dam to prevent it from dipping even lower. Anxieties stretch beyond hydropower. Last summer, tourism and boating were hobbled by falling lake levels. The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is taking advantage of the low levels at Lake Powell to extend boat ramps. Most are now closed or come with warnings to launch at your own risk. In Page, Arizona, which benefits from recreation at Lake Powell, officials launched a campaign this month to highlight that lower levels aren’t necessarily bad for visitors, noting receding shorelines have revealed sunken boats, canyons and other geographic wonders. “There’s tremendous amounts of history out there,” City Councilman Richard Leightner said. “You can see some of the old dwellings, and parts of the Old Spanish Trail are accessible now. It’s an opportunity, but it just depends on the person’s frame of mind.” The record low also comes after a tough year for hydropower. Last year, as U.S. officials worked to expand renewable energy, drought in the West drove a decline in hydropower generation, making it harder for officials to meet demand. Hydropower accounts for more than one-third of the nation’s utility-scale renewable energy. Nick Williams, the bureau’s Upper Colorado Basin power manager, said many variables, including precipitation and heat, will determine the extent to which Lake Powell rebounds in the coming months. Regardless, hydrology modeling suggests there’s roughly a 1 in 4 chance it won’t be able to produce power by 2024. ___ Fonseca reported from Flagstaff, Arizona."
1,Watch An Angry Lion Charge At Scavengers Feasting On His Elephant Carcass,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A hungry lion charged at vultures and hyenas feeding on an elephant carcass in South Africa’s Timbavati Game Reserve recently ― and he had extra motivation to keep the remains for himself. (Watch the video below.) Field guide Rushada Schutte, who shot the remarkable footage, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the lion was limping from an injury in a previous fight. “He was going to make sure no one was eating his food because it is very difficult for him to run and hunt,” Schutte, who works at Timbavati’s Machaton Private Camp, wrote in an email. Schutte said she heard from other guides that the lion was making his way back to the scavenger-surrounded carcass from the river, where he had a drink. “So we positioned the vehicle in hopes that we would capture his return on video,” she said. “Lions are very possessive over their meals and (we) knew he would chase them off if he saw them eating his meal.” “He could not have made a better entrance upon his return,” Schutte wrote in the Instagram caption.

2,Jon Stewart Confusingly Seems To Side With Fossil Fuel Companies In New Apple TV+ Show,environment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Jon Stewart takes a deep dive on a number of issues, from gun control to COVID-19 safety protocols, on his new Apple TV+ series. His remarks on climate change, however, have left some of his fans feeling a bit perplexed. In a teaser clip from the March 10 episode of “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” the host appears to offer a surprising (if qualified) defense of fossil fuel companies. “A hundred of these companies create 70% of our global emissions,” Stewart says in the clip, which clocks in at about seven and a half minutes and can be viewed below. “Wouldn’t it be better to hold our noses, to not villainize them, to understand that no industry is ever going to cut its own throat and take away its profits? How do we bribe them?” We should hold fossil fuel companies accountable, but they are not our enemies. They are our frenemies. https://t.co/7cFHtrEmjh pic.twitter.com/WozngxyOaU Based on the isolated footage, it’s unclear whether the former “Daily Show” host was merely attempting to play devil’s advocate with his suggestions. Later in the clip, he talks about the unlikelihood of fossil fuel companies ever being held to account ― and suggests instead trying to leverage the industry’s desire for profit in a way that would get those companies to join in on the transition to a more sustainable world: Fossil fuel companies have so much power in this country, and they have the power, unfortunately, to destabilize the governments that would do the most to make that transition. And so what I’m saying is, co-opt whatever their greed principle is, to make it so that they own this transition ― or at least part of it ― so that they’re no longer incentivized to oppose it. Because that accountability never happens, because behind closed doors, there’s too much money involved. And so in some ways, we have to bribe them. Still, the clip garnered a blistering response from many viewers on social media. Several people pointed out that Stewart’s guests for the episode included Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, whose talking points went mostly unchallenged. “No, fossil fuel companies need to be taken over and dismantled at gunpoint,” Noah Weston, better known as the rapper and songwriter Soul Khan, tweeted. “They have been genocidally destructive after knowingly lying about the climate crisis for decades ... Fossil fuel extraction is going to be the most murderous enterprise in human history.” “‘The Problem with Jon Stewart’ is the most unintentionally perfect name for the whole program,” filmmaker Jesse Hawken tweeted. Stewart’s show was initially touted as his long-awaited return to television after a seven-year hiatus, but the series has drawn mixed reviews since its premiere last fall. Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall described show as being “stuck in the past,” while NPR’s Eric Deggans wrote that it feels “like a stitched-together pastiche of items from Stewart’s old show and a few other programs he inspired.” At Vox, Constance Grady wrote a consideration of “The Problem” that doubled as an essay on how the brand of liberalism Stewart popularized at “The Daily Show” has aged poorly.

3,Labs Still No. 1 US Dog Breed But Poodles Are Popping In Popularity,environment," NEW YORK (AP) — Labrador retrievers are still tugging hardest on U.S. dog lovers’ heartstrings, but poodles just strutted back into the American Kennel Club’s top five most popular dog breeds for the first time in nearly a quarter-century. The club’s annual popularity rankings came out Tuesday, drawn from more than 800,000 purebred puppies and older pooches that joined the nation’s oldest canine registry last year. With 197 recognized breeds, the list ranges from such familiar furry faces as Labs — No. 1 for an unprecedented 31 straight years — to the newly added Biewer terrier (making a strong debut at #82) and unusual pups like the hairless Xoloitzcuintli (#119). For dog fans, there’s plenty to dig into (like a dachshund, #10) and point out (like a pointer, #120). So we’ve rounded up (like a border collie, #31) some highlights: TOP 10 After Labs, the top 10 are: French bulldogs, golden retrievers, German shepherds, poodles, bulldogs, beagles, Rottweilers, German shorthaired pointers and dachshunds. OODLES OF POODLES Poodles reigned as top dog from 1960 to 1982 before falling off somewhat in popularity. But in the new statistics, they reclaimed the fifth spot for the first time since 1997. (The standard, miniature and toy sizes are all counted as one breed.) With their proud stance and elaborate cut in the show ring, “they do have a reputation, in some circles, as just being froufrou,” says longtime poodle owner and sometime breeder Page Hinds-Athan of Roswell, Georgia. “There’s definitely more to them.” Poodles historically were water retrievers, and they remain athletic animals renowned for their smarts, not to mention their allergy-friendly coats. Hinds-Athan’s poodles have made therapy visits in hospitals and compete in obedience. Other poodles work as guide dogs for the blind, hunt or compete in agility or other dog sports. Their intelligence comes with some high expectations, Hinds-Athan says: In training, “if you’re going to fuss at them, you’d better be really right. Because if you’re not really fair with them, they remember it.” AND DOODLES? Poodles also make up part of several popular hybrids, such as Labradoodles, maltipoos and sheepadoodles. The AKC, a governing body for many dog shows, doesn’t currently recognize any of those as breeds. But AKC spokesperson Brandi Hunter says poodle-mix fans have made some inquiries about what recognition would involve. One key requirement is articulating an ideal for the breed, in order to attain some consistency. “The predictability is one of the things that draws people to purebred dogs,” Hunter explains. ON THE RARE SIDE The rarest breed last year was the Norwegian lundehund, consistently sparse in the U.S. The smallish dogs boast extra toes and unusual flexibility that once helped them climb Norwegian cliffs to hunt puffins nesting in narrow crevices. BREEDS ON THE RISE The standings often don’t change a lot from year to year, but they do over time. Eight breeds, from the low-lying Pembroke Welsh corgi (#11) to the towering great Dane (#17), have entered the top 25 since the start of the century. Some have made Olympian leaps in popularity. French bulldogs, now #2 and a common sight from TV commercials to cosmopolitan streets, ranked a distant 71st in 2000. The cane corso, which wasn’t recognized until 2010, has since climbed from 51st to 21st. The imposing, mastiff-style cane corso goes back many centuries in rural Italy as a farm guardian that also pulled small carts and hunted wild boar. Its versatility endures, says Anthony Simonski, who has owned or bred corsi (that’s the proper plural) that compete in agility, dock diving and other sports and have appeared in TV shows and music videos. While the dogs are protective, “it’s not about being mean — it’s about understanding its job,” says Simonski, of Acworth, Georgia. Simonski has owned corsi since 1998 and is married to Cane Corso Association of America President Rebecca Simonski. He has mixed feelings about their growing popularity, feeling that it draws questionable breeders. “There’s a side of you going, ‘Oh, my God, the cat’s out of the bag.’ But the real problem is what people are doing with that cat once it’s out of the bag,” he says. DOG BREEDING DEBATED Some animal-rights advocates say dog breeding itself is a problem. They argue that fanciers focus more on dogs’ appearance than their health and that promoting purebreds ends up fueling puppy mills and stranding other dogs in shelters. The AKC says it and its affiliated breed clubs champion and invest in dog health, including through an AKC-affiliated foundation. The club also maintains that properly done breeding has a purpose: to produce dogs with known traits, from size to sniffing ability, that fit different human needs and lifestyles. New purebred registrations, which are voluntary, have increased by 45% in a decade, the club says."
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Trapped Antelope Await Attack By Wild Dogs In A Surprising Cliffhanger,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Wild dogs waited to pounce on cornered antelope atop a high rocky outcrop in South Africa. But three small antelope called klipspringers kept their cool as they clung to the cliff in a tense standoff at MalaMala Game Reserve, a recent YouTube video on Latest Sightings shows. (Watch it below.) The young dogs appeared poised to attack at several moments, but their shaky footing kept delaying what seemed to be inevitable. As it turned out, the dogs eventually gave up and sauntered off with the older members of the pack, head guide Gareth van Rooyen told Lastest Sightings, a wildlife viewing platform. Guides Michael Botes and Steff McWilliam shot the footage. Van Rooyen told the channel that the small antelopes’ pointy hooves make them nimble on rocks, while the dogs’ paws were not designed for such climbing. With hooves “about the diameter of a dime, this pint-sized rock hopper can jump onto a landing pad the size of a silver dollar,” the San Diego Zoo wrote of klipspringers. “Its delicate-looking feet are specially adapted for traction on rocky surfaces, with a slight suction-cup effect.” No wonder they didn’t become lunch. The dogs eventually found something else on the menu. They were seen later hunting an impala, according to van Rooyen. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
11,The GOP's Biggest Whoppers About Biden And Fossil Fuels,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Republican lawmakers and right-wing media have responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by waging a misinformation campaign about the Biden administration being “at war with fossil fuels.” The goal, of course, is to leverage the crisis in Eastern Europe to provide more access and regulatory relief to an oil and gas sector that is already very profitable, heavily subsidized, has enormous sway in Washington, and is sitting on unused permits to drill across millions of acres of land and water. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) accused President Joe Biden of leading “a frontal assault on oil and gas.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) bemoaned Biden’s “backwards, America-last energy policies.” And numerous other industry-backed members of the GOP have spent the days since Russia launched its violent war peddling industry talking points and demanding Biden “unleash” America’s full oil and gas potential. The GOP campaign to blame Biden for both Russia’s war and high gas prices has included misleading statements and outright falsehoods, as well as circulating lists of demands that closely mirror those of the fossil fuel industry. It is being led by some of Washington’s largest beneficiaries of industry campaign donations. And it comes on the heels of the latest dire climate report from the United Nations, which warns that the window for reining in greenhouse gases in order to “secure a livable and sustainable future” is rapidly closing. Let’s break down some of the biggest whoppers: In a post to Twitter this week, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) wrote that rising prices at the pump during Biden’s presidency “is what happens when you destroy America’s energy industry” — part of a broader argument that Biden is waging “war” on domestic fossil fuel companies. For a destroyed industry, Big Oil is doing exceptionally well. Two years after the pandemic tanked oil demand and prices, the nation’s largest producers — ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips — have seen their profits skyrocket alongside energy prices. And while Biden campaigned on a promise to “take on the fossil fuel industry” and end drilling on federal lands and waters, that has not materialized. In fact, to the frustration of climate and environmental advocates, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits during his first year in office than former President Donald Trump did in any of his first three, according to data compiled by the conservation group Center for Western Priorities. It also held the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico last year. A federal judge later vacated those leases, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held the offshore auction. “The Biden admin is doing next to nothing to practically inhibit near-term oil production,” Casey Merriman, an analyst at the industry research firm Energy Intelligence, wrote on Twitter. None of this is likely to temper Republican rhetoric. Biden’s “agencies have been waging war on domestic production, and we’ve seen domestic production dropping and dropping and dropping,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told Fox News this week. In reality, the U.S. produced more oil and gas during Biden’s first year in office than during Trump’s, and crude oil output is forecast to reach a record high in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Good morning https://t.co/PFNmFOGiEb pic.twitter.com/Qe5wChFb4g In an interview late last month with right-wing news outlet Newsmax, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine because of Biden’s energy policies, including “ending drilling on federal lands.” Biden did not end federal drilling — far from it. Early in his tenure, Biden paused new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters pending the outcome of a review of the federal leasing program — an action that industry-allied Republicans falsely labeled a “ban” and falsely predicted would devastate the energy sector. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana later struck down Biden’s executive order that froze new leasing. More recently, in February, the Biden administration instituted a second pause on new federal leasing and permitting in response to a second Trump-appointed judge’s ruling that blocked the administration from using a higher calculation for the damages associated with planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. None of this has prevented U.S. companies from moving ahead with drilling under already approved federal permits or on state or private lands. Approximately 75% of domestic oil production and 86% of gas production occurs on state and private lands, according to the Interior Department. As White House press secretary Jen Psaki has pointed out repeatedly in recent weeks, the industry has stockpiled more than 9,000 unused but approved permits to drill onshore. Nearly half of the roughly 25 million federal land acres currently under lease are not currently in production. “I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more,” Psaki told Fox News’ Peter Doocy during a press conference this week. White House @PressSec Jen Psaki:""There are 9,000 unused approved drilling permits. So, I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they're not using those if there's a desire to drill more."" pic.twitter.com/I86jhV2HbD While Republicans revive the “drill, baby, drill” mantra and demand Biden “unleash” American energy, the oil and gas sector and its Wall Street investors have made clear they have little interest in ramping up drilling amid record high prices, as NPR has reported. And even if they did, it would do little if anything to ease gas prices in the short term. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline was a proposed 1,179-mile, $8.5 billion project that would have transported some 830,000 barrels of dirty tar sands oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL via a climate executive order on his first day in office, effectively killing it. Only 8% of the pipeline was constructed and it never carried oil. Nevertheless, Republicans have attacked Biden with falsehoods about the beleaguered project, at times conflating it with the larger Keystone Pipeline system that’s been in operation since 2010 and which the Keystone XL was supposed to tie into. Biden “shut off the Keystone Pipeline,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) declared in an interview last week. “Get the Keystone Pipeline operating again!” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) demanded at a congressional hearing. “If we had a strong president, he would put the Keystone Pipeline back online,” Gov. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) told Fox News. And at a press conference Tuesday, Sen. Roy Blunt falsely stated that the Keystone XL would have “produced” roughly the same number of barrels that the U.S. currently imports from Russia. Again, the Keystone XL was never operational. And it was never going to “produce” a drop of oil. Rather, it was a proposed extension, or shortcut, to transport Canadian oil to Nebraska, where it would link up with the existing Keystone pipeline and be sent to refineries in Texas and ultimately exported overseas. Asked Wednesday if Biden would reconsider his decision to kill the Keystone XL, Psaki said doing so would not address any of the current petroleum problems in the U.S. “The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism, it is not an oil field,” Psaki said. “It does not provide more supply into the system.” There are many iterations, but the Republican argument is basically that Biden “reversed,” “sabotaged” and “sacrificed” the so-called “energy independence” — some call it “energy dominance” — that the U.S. purportedly achieved under Trump. “​​Trump gave us energy independence. Biden gave us expensive gas,” Jordan recently tweeted. “Biden’s anti-energy policies have caused skyrocketing prices, ended America’s energy independence, and compromised our national security,” House Republicans wrote in a post from their official Twitter account. “Energy independence” can have different meanings. If Republicans are talking about simply producing more energy than we consume, the U.S. remains energy independent today, as Robert Rapier, an energy industry engineer and author, pointed out in a Forbes piece this week. But if they’re talking about a nation free of any imported petroleum products, the U.S. never achieved that under Trump. “Flatly stated, the United States is not oil-independent, and hasn’t been since the early days of oil production,” Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman wrote this week. The U.S. has been the world’s largest producer of oil and gas since 2018. And in 2020, it became a net exporter of oil for the first time. Still, it imports millions of barrels of oil per day, including from Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and, until recently, Russia. Earlier this week, Biden signed an executive order banning Russian petroleum imports — a move that had bipartisan support but that Biden warned would drive gas prices up even higher. (Under Trump’s watch, Russian oil imports increased 39%, as HuffPost reported). As the last few months have highlighted, the U.S. remains at the mercy of a global energy market that sets oil and gas prices at home and abroad — a reality that the Biden administration and environmentalists argue should motivate the nation to transition quickly to renewable energy sources.

12,"California Can Set Tough Vehicle Emissions Rules Again, Biden Administration Says",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration on Wednesday restored California’s legal authority to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks in an attempt to better address climate change. The restoration comes after former President Donald Trump withdrew California’s ability to set its own tailpipe emissions standards in 2019, part of a broader effort to eviscerate the nation’s environmental policies. California first received a waiver under the Clean Air Act to create the tougher standards as a way to address its smog problems. The state has also been a leader in electric vehicle adoption. Trump’s decision wasn’t supported by the auto industry. In fact, five major car manufacturers signed a deal with California in 2020 to voluntarily follow the state’s emissions standards even though they weren’t required to by law. On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized California’s “longstanding” efforts to be a leader in addressing pollution from vehicles, and said the agency’s “partnership with states to confront the climate crisis has never been more important.” “With today’s action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. The impact of this change could be monumental. According to The New York Times, California is the most populous state and the world’s fifth-largest economy. California lawmakers’ actions reverberate throughout the auto industry and have been adopted by many other states. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Wednesday the state would only continue its transition towards zero-emission vehicles. As part of an effort to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035, the state plans to increase electric vehicle requirements by 2030. “The restoration of our state’s Clean Air Act waiver is a major victory for the environment, our economy, and the health of families across the country that comes at a pivotal moment underscoring the need to end our reliance on fossil fuels,” Newsom said in a statement. “California looks forward to partnering with the Biden Administration to make a zero-emission future a reality for all Americans.” President Joe Biden has also worked to hasten the adoption of electric vehicles. He signed an executive order last year to see the U.S. have half of all cars sold be electric, fuel cell or plug-in hybrids by 2030. Fossil fuels from transportation are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, clocking in at 29% of America’s total.

13,55 Tons Of Lettuce Fed To Florida Manatees In Bid To Save Them From Starvation,environment," ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — More than 55 tons of lettuce have been fed to starving Florida manatees as part of an experimental program to help the slow-moving marine mammals since their natural food is being destroyed by water pollution, wildlife officials said Wednesday. The lettuce, funded by more than 1,000 individual donations, is offered to manatees that gather in the warm water discharge near a power plant on Florida’s east coast as they typically do during cold months. Officials from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission  and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a conference call that the feeding program has made a difference. “That’s a substantial amount,” said Ron Mezich, feeding program coordinator for the Florida wildlife commission. “We’re not done yet.” The unprecedented feeding response came after a  record 1,100 manatees died last year, largely because of starvation. The problem requires a long-term solution because pollution from agriculture, septic tanks, urban runoff and other sources is killing the seagrass on which the marine mammals rely. Through Feb. 25 this year, about 375 confirmed manatee deaths have been recorded. That compares to 389 during the same period last year; both are far above the 136 deaths reported in 2020 during the first two months. More than 80 rescued manatees are currently being cared for at facilities in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and Ohio, according to Terri Calleson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Some of those are abandoned calves that typically take longer to recover. Florida legislators last year provided $8 million for several seagrass restoration projects that will get off the ground this year, officials said. But it won’t be an immediate solution. “We’re not solving the seagrass issue in a year,” said Tom Reinert of the Florida wildlife commission. There are currently about 7,500 manatees, also known as sea cows, living in Florida waters. They are listed federally as a threatened species, although there are efforts to give them the heightened endangered designation. The approach of warmer weather means manatees will disperse to areas where food is more plentiful, officials said. “It’s warming up, and that’s a good thing for manatees. They’ll be moving on,” Reinert said. Officials say most distressed manatees in Florida are reported by people who spot them and call a state hotline at 888-404-3922."
14,Oil Workers On Foreign-Flagged Ships Are At The Mercy of Corporations,environment," Reporter, Floodlight This story is a collaboration between Floodlight and HuffPost. It also appeared in The Lens and WWNO in New Orleans. It was supported by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism. As Hurricane Ida zeroed in on Louisiana, Howell McIntyre was trapped nearly 100 miles offshore aboard a 620-foot drillship named the Globetrotter II. The Category 4 storm pummeled the ship with 150 mph winds and waves as tall as oak trees, threatening to capsize it. McIntyre was knocked against a wall, banging his head and knees. Another worker, Michael Brunner, was thrown from his bed and slammed into lockers. “The entire crew believed they were going to die,” reads one lawsuit filed against employers Noble Drilling and Shell Oil on behalf of 10 crew members injured on the ship that day.Out of more than 100 workers aboard when Ida hit, at least 13 are suing for compensation related to traumatic brain and back injuries. They say the companies failed to send a helicopter to evacuate them, even as the storm’s danger became clear. But the workers face a significant legal hurdle: While the Globetrotter II is owned by a U.S. company and was contracted by a British company, it sails under a Liberian flag, which means it’s not subject to many of the labor and environmental regulations American vessels must follow. Flying a foreign flag is just one way companies evade accountability for injuries and deaths that occur while pulling oil and natural gas from the seafloor, an inherently dangerous line of work. Oil and gas extraction workers on land and offshore are about six times more likely than the average U.S. worker to be killed on the job, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2008 to 2017, the most recent data available. Even as the offshore workforce has shrunk 40% in recent years, fatalities have increased. And new data collected by Floodlight and HuffPost finds that offshore deaths in particular are being undercounted. At least 138 offshore oil and gas workers died on the job between 2007 and 2020, according to aggregated public records from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard. However, the BSEE disclosed only 53 fatalities during that time period. That’s in part because the agency has excluded deaths that occur on the way to or from drilling rigs and those from causes like heart attacks, which might be treatable if workers weren’t so far from civilization. Of the offshore fatalities where Floodlight and HuffPost were able to determine the flag of the ship, about 40% occurred on vessels flagged in other countries, including the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 men. Companies register their ships in other countries that have weaker worker protections and environmental regulations than the U.S., allowing them to save money by avoiding higher standards. But crews on foreign-flagged ships and their families may have a harder time getting compensated under a U.S. law that gives them the right to sue for injuries and death at sea, according to maritime injury lawyers. In the final weeks of the Obama administration, regulators tried to close a loophole that allows American companies to register vessels abroad — and had rare support from business-friendly Louisiana Republicans — but dropped the effort after significant industry pushback. The rule change would have limited the use of foreign-flagged vessels in the U.S. offshore industry. Billboards for maritime injury lawyers line the roads of Lafourche Parish. “We take care of your family while you can’t work,” reads a billboard in Lockport, Louisiana, advertising Blake Jones Law Firm. Every month, roughly 15,000 workers are flown from the parish to offshore oil and gas facilities, according to the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. For many, the opportunity to make good money offshore is still worth the risk. “There’s four choices if you go to school in south Louisiana: move, fish, oil and gas, or crime,” said Jon Mills, a deckhand from southern Louisiana. Mills was on a lift boat last April before it got caught in a storm and capsized off the coast of Louisiana, killing 13 men. “People called to see if I was OK,” he said. “Us boat guys, we’re like a family.” Those aboard the Globetrotter II during Hurricane Ida feared they would have the same fate. Nearby oil platforms were already fully evacuated and other drillships had moved out of the storm’s path, and the window they had to avoid the hurricane was closing. Videos the crew recorded as Ida bore down showed the vessel taking on water. Noble Drilling never gave the ship an order to stop work, and neither Noble nor Shell told the crew to evacuate. As New Orleans meteorologists warned that Ida’s winds were topping 100 mph, the captain, who was not named in reports, made the call to try to navigate away from the storm. But the crew wasn’t finished disconnecting the drillship from the seafloor and struggled to wrench off overtorqued bolts. When the ship moved, pieces of drilling risers broke away and more than a dozen tanks on the deck overturned, spilling 3,700 gallons of lube oil and hydraulic fluid into the Gulf. The vessel suffered $1 million in damage, according to the BSEE incident report. While the whole Globetrotter II crew survived, four injured workers were medevaced to shore to be evaluated after the storm. “You’re at the mercy of the company. They have to evacuate the crew by helicopter,” said Houston-based attorney Kurt Arnold, who filed the suit on behalf of 10 Globetrotter II workers. “They tried to cut it too close.” A Shell spokesperson directed requests for comment to the contractor that was running the operation, Noble Drilling. Craig Muirhead, Noble’s vice president of investor relations, declined to answer questions. While a 1920 U.S. maritime law called the Jones Act mandates that cargo vessels moving between U.S. ports must be U.S.-flagged, U.S. Customs and Border Protection created exceptions to the rule that allow for more widespread use of foreign-flagged vessels in the U.S. offshore oil industry, like the Globetrotter II. The International Transport Workers’ Federation has identified Liberia, where the Globetrotter II drillship was registered, as a “flag of convenience,” meaning shipowners can register their vessels without any connection to the country. The flag of the ship determines the shipowner’s requirements for wastewater, air pollution, safety equipment and how workers are compensated if something goes wrong, said Elizabeth DeSombre, author of “Flagging Standards: Globalization and Environmental, Safety, and Labor Regulations at Sea.” She said foreign-flagged vessels have more lax labor rules and therefore save on costs. “The big oil companies don’t want to be operating in a more expensive regulatory environment,” DeSombre said. Between 2005 and 2021, 51 fatalities in the Gulf of Mexico occurred on vessels flying flags of convenience. Some of the fatal events detailed in Coast Guard documents were never reported by the media. In one November 2018 incident, three workers died and two had to be medevaced off a floating platform named the Ocean Whittington after workers were exposed to deadly levels of carbon monoxide because the vessel didn’t have detectors. The platform was flying the Panama flag. Arnold, the Houston-based lawyer, said he is working with about 60 workers who were left out in the Gulf to ride out storms on offshore vessels in recent years. “This is the most I’ve represented within a year’s time period, which shows the companies aren’t taking the precautions that they should,” Arnold said. In January 2017, the Obama administration proposed throwing out Customs and Border Protection’s exemptions to the Jones Act. In an unusual occurrence in Louisiana, the proposal put even Republican officials at odds with the oil and gas industry. American-flagged ships are required to be built in the U.S. and employ more American workers, which helped the move gain support with the maritime unions. Thirty-one Louisiana state representatives, including Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, signed a letter in support of the rule change, underscoring that it would benefit Louisiana workers. Even Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican and staunch supporter of the oil industry, supported the revision. But Customs and Border Protection faced opposition from Louisiana’s oil and gas industry and the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees drilling in Texas’ Gulf waters. In a public comment to CBP, Bruce Culpepper, Shell’s president at the time, argued that the proposal was politically motivated and shouldn’t have emerged just 48 hours before the end of the Obama administration. Shell and Chevron also submitted comments on the draft rule, arguing there weren’t enough American-made vessels able to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton warned in comments that the proposal would kill jobs and reduce revenue, echoing talking points from the American Petroleum Institute. Four months later — under the new Trump administration — the agency dropped the proposed rulemaking altogether. The White House did not return a request for comment on whether it has plans to close the loophole. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) recently introduced a bill to improve the oversight of foreign-flagged ships that operate in the offshore industry. The American Offshore Worker Fairness Act, introduced in mid-February, would require offshore energy vessels to provide details about who owns the ships on an annual basis. The bill could address the concerns of maritime injury lawyers who say flags of convenience allow shipowners to remain legally anonymous, making it harder to bring claims against them. But the bill would only address one loophole that oil and gas companies use to try to escape liability when workers are injured or die offshore. Drillships are also frequently run by contracted companies because contractors cannot be held criminally liable for worker deaths. Under another law, oil and gas companies can try to cap the damages they have to pay to injured workers. Those payments are based on the value of the vessel, which drops after damages from accidents or severe weather events. Matthew Shaffer, a Houston-based attorney with Schechter, Shaffer & Harris who has filed three suits on behalf of workers injured on the Globetrotter II, said the entire system is set up against workers. The companies are “always interested in making money, and sometimes that comes at the cost of safety. It’s a fine line that they run,” Shaffer said. Mills, the deckhand from southern Louisiana, said that despite the risks of his job, he tries to see the beauty in his situation, like the uninterrupted views of the night sky from a ship out in the Gulf. “You see stuff people don’t get to see every day,” he said. Offshore workers are at nature’s mercy — for better or worse. Reporter, Floodlight"
15,Octopus Ancestors Lived Before Era Of Dinosaurs: Study,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have found the oldest known ancestor of octopuses – an approximately 330 million-year-old fossil unearthed in Montana. The researchers concluded the ancient creature lived millions of years earlier than previously believed, meaning that octopuses originated before the era of dinosaurs. The 4.7-inch (12-centimeter) fossil has 10 limbs — modern octopuses have eight — each with two rows of suckers. It probably lived in a shallow, tropical ocean bay. “It’s very rare to find soft tissue fossils, except in a few places,” said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study. “This is a very exciting finding. It pushes back the ancestry much farther than previously known.” The specimen was discovered in Montana’s Bear Gulch limestone formation and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada in 1988. For decades, the fossil sat overlooked in a drawer while scientists studied fossil sharks and other finds from the site. But then paleontologists noticed the 10 tiny limbs encased in limestone. The well-preserved fossil also “shows some evidence of an ink sac,” probably used to squirt out a dark liquid cloak to help to evade predators, just like modern octopuses, said Christopher Whalen, an American Museum of Natural History paleontologist and co-author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The creature, a vampyropod, was likely the ancestor of both modern octopuses and vampire squid, a confusingly named marine critter that’s much closer to an octopus than a squid. Previously, the “oldest known definitive” vampyropod was from around 240 million years ago, the authors said. The scientists named the fossil Syllipsimopodi bideni, after President Joe Biden. Whether or not having an ancient octopus — or vampire squid — bearing your name is actually a compliment, the scientists say they intended admiration for the president’s science and research priorities. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

0,Pentagon To Shut Down Navy Fuel Tank Facility In Hawaii Amid Massive Leak,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department will permanently shut down the Navy’s massive fuel tank facility in Hawaii that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water, and will remove all the fuel, the Pentagon said Monday. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the decision by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is based on a new Pentagon assessment, but also is in line with an order from Hawaii’s Department of Health to drain fuel from the tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The tanks, built into the side of a mountain during World War II to protect them from enemy attack, had leaked into a drinking water well and contaminated water at Pearl Harbor homes and offices. Nearly 6,000 people, mostly those living in military housing at or near Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam were sickened, seeking treatment for nausea, headaches, rashes and other ailments. And 4,000 military families were forced out of their homes and are in hotels. BREAKING: RED HILL IS CLOSING. Defense Secretary has just announced that the DoD will permanently shut down Red Hill. There will be challenges ahead, but make no mistake: Red Hill will be shut down. Austin spoke with Hawaii government leaders on Monday to inform them of the decision, which he said will protect the population and the environment, and will also lay the groundwork for a more secure military fueling system. “This is the right thing to do,” Austin said in a statement. “Centrally-located bulk fuel storage of this magnitude likely made sense in 1943, when Red Hill was built. And Red Hill has served our armed forces well for many decades. But it makes a lot less sense now. ” U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said she has been encouraging the Pentagon to make the shutdown decision for weeks. “I have said from day one that ensuring the health and safety of the residents of Oahu is my top priority and I share the community’s big sigh of relief with this news,” said Hirono, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Seabees assigned to Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Hawaii, continue to monitor pump systems at Red Hill Well in support of water recovery efforts. pic.twitter.com/5dxi9O2Hbz The Pentagon said it will move to a more dispersed fueling system for military ships and aircraft in the Indo-Pacific. Based on the new assessment, the expanded system will be more cost effective and provide greater security by spreading the fuel supply more broadly across the region. The new plan, laid out in recommendations delivered to Austin by a study group, would increase the fuel contracts that the U.S. has with other territories and nations in the Indo-Pacific, and add several more tanker ships that are based at sea. There are currently less than a dozen tanker ships, so several more would have to be built. An assessment team that had been studying how to make the tanks safe to operate will now determine how to shut the tanks down and remove the fuel in an environmentally safe way. The team must report back to Austin by the end of April with recommendations. After the facility can operate again, the defueling will begin and the process is expected to take about a year, meaning it would be finished some time next year. Austin has asked the Navy secretary to plan a budget for all necessary corrective action for any prior fuel releases from the facility. Austin said the department will also work with state, national and local leaders to clean up the contamination and consider other uses for the property after the fueling plant is closed. And the military will also provide healthcare to the families and workers affected. U.S. Rep. Kaiali’i Kahele said the military must also make sure it cleans up the contaminated aquifer underneath the fuel tanks which. The Navy’s water system and Honolulu’s municipal water utility use that aquifer. “At this point, the extent of contamination and environmental damage is not yet known. We know fuel continues to drip, as we speak, from the rock formations into our fresh water aquifer right now,” the Hawaii Democrat said in a statement. The tanks can hold 250 million gallons (1.1 billion liters) of fuel, and they are at less than half capacity right now. Officials said that 13 of the 20 tanks have fuel in them, two are permanently closed and five are being repaired. The Navy hasn’t determined how the petroleum got in the water. Officials are investigating a theory that jet fuel spilled from a ruptured pipe last May and somehow entered a fire suppression system drain pipe. They suspect fuel then leaked from the second pipe on Nov. 20, sending it into the drinking water well. Weeks after the leak was discovered, Hawaii state officials and members of Congress began to demand the shutdown of the facility. The Navy in early February appealed the state’s closure order, and at the time Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said the appeal would give the military time “to make evidence-based and transparent decisions.” Kirby on Monday said the department realizes the closure of the fuel complex will not be a quick fix. “We have work to do,” he said. “But we do believe that this decision by the Secretary today marks a significant first step in the path forward.” U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said political leaders will need to make that the military follows through on its plans. “In order to implement this decision, we’re going to have to provide additional resources and hold (the Department of Defense’s) feet to the fire through congressional oversight,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report from Honolulu."
1,4 Of 7 Killed In Iowa Tornadoes From Same Family: Sheriff,environment," Four of the seven people killed in devastating storms that tore through central Iowa were members of the same family who were huddled together in the pantry of a home that was razed by a powerful tornado, authorities said. Two children, their father and their grandmother all died Saturday when a tornado hit the grandparents’ home near rural Winterset that didn’t have a basement. Family members said the children’s mother, 8-year-old brother, grandfather and uncle survived the storm, but they were injured. The children and their parents, from Blue Springs, Missouri, were visiting their grandmother, Melissa Bazley, 63, when the tornado hit. The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children, 5-year-old Kinlee Bolger and 2-year-old Owen Bolger. A GoFundMe page for the family says Kuri Bolger, who is the children’s mother and Bazley’s daughter, was hospitalized after being seriously injured. Lynn Larson said her daughter-in-law, Kuri Bolger, underwent surgery on her leg Monday and faces another surgery on her arm to repair broken bones. Her oldest grandson was treated at the hospital and released. Larson said she and the rest of her family are “just devastated.” “I just can’t describe how wonderful Mike was. Everybody loved him,” Larson said. “It just rips your heart out. My grandchildren were wonderful. They were just the light of my life.” Two others killed in the tornado — Rodney Clark, 64, and Cecilia Lloyd, 72 — lived in homes just down the street from Bazley that were also hit by the tornado. It was rated an EF-4, with peak winds of 170 mph (274 kph), the National Weather Service said Monday. The tornado was on the ground for nearly 70 miles (113 kilometers), leaving the longest path of destruction since a 1984 tornado that carved a path 117 miles (188 kilometers) long. The seventh death came from Lucas County, about 54 miles (87 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines, when a separate tornado struck less than an hour later, injuring several other people. Officials there said Monday that Jesse Theron Fisher, 40, of Chariton, Iowa, died in the storm and another area resident remained hospitalized. The state Department of Natural Resources said that Fisher was in an RV at a campground at Red Haw State Park near Chariton when the storm struck. The storms that raked Iowa on Saturday were the deadliest to occur in the state since May 2008, when one tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine people in the northern Iowa city of Parkersburg. Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa. Saturday’s storms damaged or destroyed other homes and downed power lines and trees, causing some power outages. The tornadoes were followed by winter storms overnight Sunday into Monday that dropped about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) of snow in central Iowa and 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) in Mount Vernon in eastern Iowa. The snow prompted officials to cancel Monday’s planned storm cleanup efforts after hundreds of volunteers helped out on Sunday. The cleanup was expected to resume Tuesday, but more snow is in the forecast for Thursday, which could cause additional delays. Elsewhere, the National Weather Service said the storms generated an EF-1 tornado in southeastern Wisconsin near Stoughton that included winds up to 80 mph. The storm flattened trees, snapped power poles and blew out windows in homes. No injuries were reported. One expert estimated the storms Saturday likely caused more than $1 billion damage altogether. ___ The spelling of Kinlee Bolger’s first name has been corrected."
2,13 Mistakes Tourists Make While Visiting Arizona,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life The appeal of Arizona as a vacation spot is fairly obvious. The Southwest destination boasts abundant sunshine, stunning desert landscapes, national parks, bustling cities and more. But as many locals have noticed, visitors to the Grand Canyon State tend to make a few missteps during their travels. We asked Arizonans to share some of the faux pas they’ve observed over the years. From hiking blunders to missed food opportunities, here are 12 mistakes tourists often make while visiting Arizona ― and some advice for avoiding these errors during your travels. “Hydrate! Especially if you’re hiking. Tourists do not realize how essential water is in the desert and that heat can quickly creep up on you. Always having minimum a full water bottle with you could potentially be the difference between life and death. Especially during the summer.” ― Christina Nguyen, content creator at @h2ochristina “We see visitors underestimate the sun exposure and heat, arriving to the trail with not enough water and little to no sun protection. It’s best to have too much water than to have too little and recommend about 16 ounces or 0.5 liters per mile, and more if it’s strenuous. Most trailheads don’t have running water.” ― Lauren Franklin and Owen Steinwall, bloggers at The AZ Hikeaholics “We see tourists getting to the trailhead too late! Locals will get there early because the weather is cooler, and parking spots will fill up quickly.” ― Franklin and Steinwall “Make sure to research hiking spots and their parking lots before you go for it! Parking lots for hikes in Arizona are sometimes extremely small and don’t always have space for you.” ― Lacy Cain, founder of Wildjoy “The Valley of the Sun (Phoenix) is huge! You could be an hour away from someone in Phoenix yet you are both still in Phoenix. Look at the map and plan accordingly.” ― Paloma Guerrero, blogger at Glitter Glucose “It might be obvious, but the biggest mistake is visiting between the months of May to September ― best to enjoy Arizona during the good months and all its glory of hikes, outdoor activities, brunch outside, etc.” ― Jessica Bui, blogger at The Orange Home “If you want to experience all the beauty and nature here, travel to Arizona between October and April. It’s the best weather and you will actually enjoy the fun activities such as hiking! As a local, we do not like being outside during the summer months!” ― Aiesha Beasley, content creator and TikTok influencer “We get a lot of tourists that show up in the middle of the summer when it’s hotter than you know what and decide to go hiking with little or no water and then of course need to get rescued because they are falling apart on top of a mountain suffering from heatstroke and dehydration. If you visit Arizona during the summer, be prepared.” ― Chanté Fox, designer and blogger “Scottsdale is a well-known city in the Phoenix area, but there is so much more to explore in the valley other than Scottsdale if they ventured out of that bubble.” ― Beasley “Guests tend to underestimate all that downtown Phoenix has to offer. Sometimes even locals who are based in the suburbs miss out on all of the latest excitement in the downtown area. From new upscale dining to local breweries and unique cocktail culture to some of Arizona’s best museums and natural attractions such as the Desert Botanical Garden and a variety of hiking trails, there’s always something to see or do outside. Plus, nothing beats an opportunity to catch an Arizona sunset in real life!” ― Jon Erickson, market director of sales and marketing at Sheraton Phoenix Downtown “Few things instantly identify a visitor more than mispronunciation of our beloved Sonoran Desert icon, the saguaro cactus. Take a stroll through any of our public gardens and you’ll hear all sorts of references to ‘cigarros,’ in which case locals are tempted to respond that this is a no-smoking area! (For the record, it’s pronounced ‘sa-WAR-o.’) On a related note, the cholla cactus is pronounced ‘choya’ and not ‘chola’ or ‘challah’!” ― Lori A. Johnson, nature photographer “Make sure to rent a car! One of the best things to do here is to take scenic drives around our beautiful mountainous ranges. From the Apache Trail to Route 66 to Sedona-to-Flagstaff Byway, you are bound to see breathtaking sights.” ― Cain “Another mistake tourists make is not understanding a lot of our trails are in rocky desert, meaning they’re uneven and strenuous on the feet and ankles. We see a lot of rescues on the news of hikers that were too injured to get down the mountain. We recommend wearing sturdy shoes or boots and to use hiking poles if you’re comfortable with them.” ― Franklin and Steinwall “Tourists see our extensive urban hiking trail system with expansive views depicted in tourist brochures around the Phoenix area and prepare as if they’re out for a stroll in a typical city park, rather than a strenuous hike, by wearing inappropriate casual footwear, and failing to carry water, for starters. Almost every rescue that makes the evening news involves ill-prepared tourists, especially in summer when temperatures can reach 110 degrees or more, which is a dangerous time to hike for anyone, much less those not acclimated to the desert.” ― Johnson “Don’t only eat at nationwide chains while you’re here. We have the best LOCAL food! When you’re here, make a stop at a food truck to try a Sonoran Hot Dog (hot dog stuffed with pinto beans, salsa, bacon, cheese, etc.) or some fresh tacos. If you can make it down to Tucson, it’s one of the gastronomy capitals of the world with people coming from all over to try the cuisine.” ― Cain “Phoenix is the new LA. Make reservations ahead of time to all the hot spots! Some of my favorites are Glai Baan, Restaurant Progress, Fat Ox, and Vecina.” ― Bui “People have to remember that Google isn’t a local. Most of the ‘best places’ listed on there are only listed because they’ve put more dollars in their SEO strategies, not because it’s a hole-in-the-wall concept or French culinary-trained chefs curating farm-to-table menus. Social media is huge now, so I would encourage tourists to navigate those platforms for the do’s & don’ts. When I’m traveling, I use bucket list Instagrams like @miamibucketlist or @sdbucketlist for recommendations. I even take it a step further by finding local influencer pages and read through their travel guides, etc.” ― Ashley Muzzillo, event planner and content creator “Most people do not know that Arizona has large sections of tribal land, and it needs to be respected. There are about 20 million acres of tribal land which is about 27% of Arizona. Most tribes welcome visitors, but there are a lot of sacred off-limit areas that need to be respected. Understand where you are traveling and what you are doing to be respectful and get the proper permits if visiting.” ― Tyler Barks, photographer and videographer “There are certain areas in Maricopa County with no signal (dead spots). One time coming back from Rocky Point, we got a flat tire and we got lucky. Somebody stopped and gave us a ride because there was no signal for miles in Maricopa.” ― Karla Lu, blogger and founder of The Polymath Mom “Look, I’m an events planner, so I appreciate a schedule or thoughtful itinerary ― but don’t be afraid to veer from that if need be! Live in the moment and be open-minded, because not every box has to be checked. You might check new boxes that come along that were far cooler than your original list. Venture outside the ‘tourist zone’ too! That’s where supporting local gets real. Sure, visit the Grand Canyon or hike Camelback Mountain, but visit our farmers markets, that’s where you’ll find the hidden gems, native goods and local secrets!” ― Muzzillo Quotes have been edited and condensed for clarity.

3,Things Get Real Batty When Real Bat Appears During Screening Of 'The Batman',environment," AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Moviegoers in Austin, Texas, got to see more than one type of bat during a screening of “The Batman” this weekend. An actual bat was spotted swooping around inside the theater, putting the movie on pause while management called animal control and tried — unsuccessfully — to get the critter out, KXAN reported Friday. Guests were offered their money back, but most chose to stick it out and watch the film “bat and all,” according to one moviegoer. The Moviehouse & Eatery by Cinépolis says the bat was likely released into the theater as a prank. The theater’s general manager Heidi Deno said they will be “adding additional security and checking all bags upon guest entry.” There were no reports of anyone being bitten during the incident. Less than 1% of bats in the wild have rabies."
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke. I beg your pardon? Pardon me? Beg your pardon?@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan@RepMTG@RepMoBrooks@RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @replouiegohmert@RepScottPerry Pardon me? Traitor says what? Others pointed out that innocent people rarely request pardons. Wow. Congressmen helping Trump on & before 1/6 & then demanding pardons. Makes me think of 18 USC 201: A public official who corruptly seeks anything of value in return for an official act or colluding in fraud shall be imprisoned for up to 15 years & disqualified from office Hi Matt. Why did you ask for a pardon? Cheers 🍻 You sought a pardon because you knew you committed a crime, helping Trump try to overturn the election.Sit down. https://t.co/jNzth4P0m2 You asked for a pardon, and now the DOJ will impolitely ask you to head to your cell, Matt.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,"1,100 Homes Evacuated In Florida Panhandle As Firefighters Battle Fires",environment," PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) — Huge wildfires in the Florida Panhandle forced veterans in a nursing home to evacuate Sunday alongside residents of more than 1,000 homes in an area still recovering from a Category 5 hurricane three years ago. Firefighters battled the 9,000-acre (about 3,642 hectare) Bertha Swamp Road fire and the 841-acre (340-hectare) Adkins Avenue fire, which have threatened homes and forced residents of at least 1,100 houses in Bay County, Florida to flee over the weekend. The Adkins Avenue fire destroyed two structures and damaged another 12 homes late Friday. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the larger Bertha Swamp Road fire “a big boy,” at a news conference in Panama City on Sunday afternoon. “It’s moving very quickly.” On Sunday, a third fire developed, forcing the evacuation of a 120-bed, state-operated nursing home in Panama City. Public transit was being used to move the residents at the Clifford Chester Sims State Veterans’ Nursing Home. Buses also were on standby in case the 1,300 inmates at the nearby Bay County Jail needed to be evacuated to other facilities. Hurricane Michael in 2018 left behind 72 million tons of destroyed trees that have provided fuel for the Bay County wildfires, according to the Florida Forest Service. The hurricane was directly responsible for 16 deaths and about $25 billion in damage in the U.S. Local authorities say they don’t know when residents will be able to return to their homes. The county opened a shelter at the Bay County Fairgrounds for displaced residents. “I know there has been frustration with people not being able to get back into their homes,” said Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford. “But we have had things that have popped up on a minute’s notice and really caused problems. As soon as we can, we will let people go back.” The Adkins Avenue fire has been burning in Bay County since Friday, forcing the evacuation of at least 600 homes, and it was 35% contained Sunday. Fire officials initially said it was 1,400 acres (567 hectares) but adjusted the size downward Sunday afternoon. 🔥 UPDATE: The @FLForestService's Blue Incident Management team will assume command of the #AdkinsAvenueFire & #BerthaSwampRoadFire on Monday under the name #ChipolaComplex. There are currently 168 wildfires burning 15.3k acres across #Florida. Read on: https://t.co/gFUT9O5W1O pic.twitter.com/I5XTlTZfMW The much-larger Bertha Swamp Fire started in neighboring Gulf County on Friday but spread to Bay and Calhoun counties Saturday, forcing the evacuation of scores of more homes. It was 10% contained as of Sunday. “It’s just hard to believe that something could be that big,” said Brad Monroe, chief of Bay County Emergency Services. “If you fly around it, it’s just incredible. It’s hard to comprehend how big, strong and fierce this fire is.” Florida Forest Service helicopters had dropped more than 103,000 gallons (about 468,000 liters) of water on the Adkins Avenue fire since Friday, and 25 bulldozers had been deployed to plow fire lines. Firefighters from all over Florida were deployed to the county to battle the blazes. “Unfortunately what we have going on today is almost a carbon copy of yesterday’s weather,” Joe Zwierzchowski, a spokesman for the Florida Forest Service, said Sunday morning. “We are looking at high, sustained winds of 10 to 15 (16 to 24 kilometers) miles per hour, gusting up to 20 to 25 miles (32 to 40 kilometers) per hour. So that’s going to make it a very dynamic situation.” Currently, there are nearly 150 wildfires burning more than 12,100 acres (about 4,900 hectares) throughout Florida, and the state is only at the very beginning of its wildfire season. “It is incredibly dry throughout the state and typically we see this kind of activity in the months of April and May,” Zwierzchowski said. “Seeing it in early March really gives us an indication of what the fire season is going to be like.” ___ Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida, and Julie Walker in New York City contributed to this report."
11,Official: 6 Dead As Large Tornado Roars Through Central Iowa,environment," DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Six people were killed Saturday when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said. Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured in addition to those killed when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m. Among those killed were children and adults. Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said 25 to 30 homes were badly damaged by the tornado. “This is the worst anyone has seen in a very long time,” he said. Officials didn’t identify those killed but said they were not all in the same location. Wendy Burkett told the Des Moines Register she and two of her three daughters were in their house Saturday afternoon when her husband, Tony, called her from a nearby shed where he was working and alerted her about a tornado warning. Burkett said she came outside and joined him in front of the house, looking down their driveway toward the southwest. “And then we saw it. The tornado,” she said. “There was debris flying around and it was getting louder and louder.” They hurried with their daughters to their basement as the tornado roared by within seconds. As they clung to each other, a window shattered outwards and water began spewing from the pipes, she said. But within about a minute, the tornado passed by, and while the family was unhurt, their home was in ruins amid debris all around, even in the trees. The National Weather Service in Des Moines tweeted later Saturday that initial photos and videos from the damage around the community of Winterset suggested it was at least an EF-3 tornado, capable of causing severe damage, on the Enhanced Fujita scale. It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating. Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa. Officials reported a number of homes were damaged, roads were blocked by downed lines and tree branches were shredded by the strong winds. Photos tweeted on social media showed downed trees, debris and damaged roofs and vehicles. At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area."
12,There's Probably No Stopping Big Invasive Spiders From Blanketing The East Coast,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost People living on the East Coast may soon be noticing some new eight-legged neighbors. Joro spiders, invasive palm-sized spiders that have become a relatively common sight in some Southeastern states, will likely be expanding their territory soon. “No predators, it doesn’t have anything that’s controlling its population size in the new habitat, but it has perfect conditions to spread,” Benjamin Frick, University of Georgia student and co-author of a new study about the hardiness of the spiders, told local news station WGCL. The study found that Joro spiders are well-equipped to survive cold temperatures, meaning they’re likely to thrive as their population spreads north. Joro spiders have a distinctive bulbous yellow abdomens and yellow-striped legs. They also have the neat ability to use their webs like balloons or parachutes to ride the wind. Originally they come from East Asia, but have been in the U.S. since at least 2013, when they most likely hitched a ride on shipping containers. But though some people find them a little freaky ― one Georgia resident referred to the arachnids as “a big no” ― scientists emphasize that they pose no threat to humans and so far haven’t been shown to have any negative environmental impacts. Last year, University of Georgia researchers said that the large numbers of spiders already seen in Georgia may actually be a good thing, since they were eating pests like mosquitoes. Now the school, which increasingly seems like it’s run by spiders, has issued a statement making a similar case. “There’s really nothing we can do to stop them,” a news release this week said. “But that’s not necessarily bad news.” Andy Davis, a research scientist at the university and another study co-author, urged people to have some compassion, even if the spiders make them feel icky. “People should try to learn to live with them,” he said. “If they’re literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they’re just going to be back next year.” Assignment editor, HuffPost"
13,A Natural Gas Giant Is Waging A Sneaky War On A Minor Colorado Climate Policy,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The natural gas industry bet billions of dollars that it can indefinitely extend its life as a “bridge fuel” away from coal-fired electricity to zero-carbon power sources. Now that renewables are eating into natural gas’s share of the electricity market, gas companies are trying to barricade themselves inside homes across the United States, hoping that slowing the switch from gas stoves and heating systems to cleaner alternatives will preserve a profit stronghold. In nearly two dozen states, that has meant successfully lobbying to ban cities from barring gas hookups in new buildings and mandating that developers go all-electric. But in Colorado, the nation’s largest gas-only utility has launched a new front group aimed at waging war against even modest proposals to nudge ratepayers toward electrification. Coloradans for Energy Access, an industry-run nonprofit that seeks to recast gas companies’ concerns as grassroots activism, is taking aim at a proposal state regulators are considering to end subsidies for new gas lines as part of the Centennial State’s goal to cut greenhouse gas output in half by the end of this decade. Audio HuffPost obtained of an internal meeting Coloradans for Energy Access held last month revealed that Texas-based utility Atmos Energy is playing a central role in the group. “Happy to be here on behalf of Coloradans for Energy Access. My full-time job, just so you all know, I work for Atmos Energy,” Jennifer Altieri, Atmos Energy’s vice president of public relations, said in a recording of the Feb. 7 presentation. “We’re the largest natural-gas-only distributor in the nation. That’s all we do.” Those last four words get to the heart of a widening fissure in the U.S. utility industry, which is the country’s No. 2 source of climate-changing emissions after automobiles. Some companies that sell both natural gas and electricity ― including major utilities in New York and California ― have begun to embrace the reality that decarbonization will mean growing their power sales at the expense of their gas businesses as ratepayers swap gas stoves, furnaces and appliances for electric alternatives. But gas stalwarts have dug in deeper. Instead of directing money toward building out new, electric-friendly revenue streams, those utilities are investing millions to fight any change to the status quo, despite clear warnings from scientists that doing so dooms U.S. efforts to curb global warming. “People are beginning to rally around getting gas combustion out of their homes around the nation,” said Rachel Golden, a principal at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute’s carbon-free buildings program. “As fossil fuel companies see this progress, they’re investing millions to form these front groups to fight back and preserve their business.” Since going live in January with a website and an opinion article in The Colorado Sun, Coloradans for Energy Access has made opposing a proposal before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to remove subsidies for new gas lines and hasten the state’s shift toward electric appliances its priority. The regulatory body is hosting a hearing on the proposal Monday. Though gas advocates say failure to subsidize the industry’s expansion will make gas more expensive, supporters of shifting away from fossil fuels say building more gas lines locks customers in to decades more use of a fuel whose pollution and volatile price swings can be easily avoided with modern technology. The concern over the highly technical issue highlights the true nature of the group’s constituency, said Amy Turner, a senior fellow at Columbia University’s Sabin Center on Climate Change Law. “It’s not a headline issue of a natural gas ban or mandating electric or even net-metering policies,” Turner said. “These are very niche, very in the weeds. Someone had to do a lot of work to identify these policy elements and mobilize opposition against them.” Atmos Energy, a nearly $16 billion company, partnered in that effort with FTI Consulting, the powerhouse consultancy behind many other fossil fuel industry propaganda campaigns. FTI employees staffed Energy in Depth and Western Wire, two pro-fossil fuel blogs that disguise themselves as journalism outlets. FTI, based in Washington, D.C., also designed, staffed or even ran a network of fake grassroots groups with such names as Texans for Natural Gas, the Arctic Energy Center and Main Street Investors Coalition that The New York Times, in an investigation of FTI’s fossil fuel work, described as deliberately appearing “to be separate efforts to amplify local voices or speak up for regular people.” During the nearly 50-minute call in February, William Allison, a senior director at FTI, said Coloradans for Energy Access’s purpose was to “protect and preserve access to natural gas in the state” and “make sure people have that choice and that freedom to choose the energy that suits them the most.” Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest utility, is also backing the group, as are a series of unions that work on fossil fuel projects. Some homebuilders groups ― who argue that designing houses and apartments for electric appliances raises costs, despite the fact that retrofitting those buildings to go electric after they’re built costs far more ― are also listed as part of the coalition. Atmos Energy did not respond to a request for comment. FTI Consulting spokesperson Matthew Bashalany declined to “comment on, confirm or deny client engagements or reports of client engagements” but directed HuffPost to Gary Arnold, a leader at a Colorado pipefitters union that is part of Coloradans for Energy Access. “Coloradans for Energy Access is a member driven and funded organization that’s focused on educating the public on the critical role that natural gas plays today in lowering emissions and keeping families warm at home,” Arnold, a business manager at Denver Pipefitters Local 208, wrote in an email. “Natural gas ― and the infrastructure that supports it ― provides good jobs [and] keeps [costs] low in homes and the workplace.” The launch of Coloradans for Energy Access comes as local gas utilities have found increasingly crafty ways of disrupting policies to promote electrification, which advocates say is critical to not only eliminating the 13% of U.S. emissions buildings spew but also reducing the damage indoor air pollution from gas stoves and furnaces does to human health. Late last year, Oklahoma Natural Gas, the state’s largest gas provider, urged regulators to allow it to impose an “exit fee” on ratepayers who quit gas service to go electric, forcing them to pay off up to $1,400 of the company’s debt. St. Louis-based Spire Energy, a $3.5 billion gas firm, last month tried to torpedo a proposal in the next set of generic U.S. building codes to expand electric vehicle charging in commercial structures. The move came nearly three years after gas utilities teamed up to gut a series of pro-electrification provisions from the last set of U.S. building codes. On the call, Atmos’s Altieri boasts that the company has helped pass pro-gas legislation in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kansas and Kentucky, which she described as “beautiful future states.” “It’s been very successful,” she said, but noted that Colorado’s “intricacies” show “the dire need for a coalition like this to not just have one voice, the gas utilities out there or just propane, it has to be multiple voices that are out there protecting our products.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,"Russia Shells Europe's Largest Nuclear Plant In Ukraine, Sparking Fire",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Russian troops shelled Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, prompting worries of an international disaster amid the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion of the country. The shelling took place at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, a city about 400 miles from Kyiv. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had spoken with Ukrainian officials, who said there are no changes in radiation levels at the site, which provides about 25% of Ukraine’s power. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, confirmed the reports on Thursday evening, saying a fire had broken out. He called for an immediate cease-fire to allow emergency officials to stop the blaze and said Russian troops were firing on the facility “from all sides.” “If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger” than the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, Kuleba tweeted. “Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” Reuters added later that the fire was in a training building outside the plant, although it could not verify its seriousness. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service said early Friday morning the blaze had been extinguished, and there were no deaths or injuries linked to the shelling. Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! Nuclear experts said the plant’s reactors are a different type than the ones used at Chernobyl and that emergency safety measures should kick in. The shelling should pose little risk if the containment vessels aren’t damaged and outside power can be restored to the site, although they warned that any military action at a nuclear facility was a danger. “We don’t know the status of the system or the power and until we do, we won’t know the full extent of the risk,” tweeted Jon B. Wolfsthal, a former adviser to then-Vice President Joe Biden. “Yes, a fire at any nuclear plant is a bad thing but there are a few things to know.” Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant, told a Ukrainian television station that one of the site’s six nuclear reactors was on fire. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but has nuclear fuel inside, he said. Open pools where spent nuclear fuel rods have been cooling are also a concern, The New York Times noted. Tuz added that firefighters initially weren’t able to get near the plant because they are being shot at, The Associated Press added. Rafael Mariano Gross, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also called for an immediate halt in military action near the plant, saying the body would continue to support Ukraine in hopes of maintaining nuclear safety and security.

15,A Battle Over Building Codes May Be The Most Important Climate Fight You’ve Never Heard Of,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost After failing to overturn an election expected to hasten the transition away from fossil fuels, conservative industry groups last year managed to get future votes canceled and tightened their grip over the process used to develop new building codes. The Biden administration protested, along with dozens of major cities, but the battle over a critical tool for shrinking the fourth-largest source of the United States’ climate-changing emissions got little attention. Now, fresh drama is afoot as the International Code Council writes the next set of codes, after a single email secretly sent by a gas utility nearly gutted a proposal widely seen as vital to increasing the adoption of electric vehicles. Last March, the private consortium of industry associations and municipal governments that crafts the generic codes adopted in all 50 states revoked local officials’ long-held right to vote on the final version of energy-related codes, replacing the election with a technocratic committee that gives companies equal say to public servants. Yet the ICC, as it is known, said the new process would make it easier for the highly technical building specifications to take bigger leaps toward decarbonizing the nation’s homes, stores and office towers. Instead, advocates now fear the latest incident illustrates how polluters enjoy even more control in a process over which they already wielded influence. The issue erupted on Feb. 9 in an email chain among members of the committee charged with authoring the energy codes for commercial buildings, one of two such panels formed as part of the procedure that replaced the old government voting system. After weeks of discussion over a proposal to require developers to include the circuitry to charge electric vehicles in more new buildings ― which can cost more than six times more to retrofit into a structure after it’s built ― the chairman of the committee, Duane Jonlin, abruptly announced in an email that he had decided to strike the proposal from the code. Instead, he said it belonged in the “appendix” that serves as a bonus menu that some more ambitious cities and towns may choose to adopt, according to copies of the exchange HuffPost obtained from a source who requested anonymity because the internal emails were private. More emails HuffPost obtained via a public records request reveal what triggered the hasty shift: Spire Energy, the $3.5 billion St. Louis-based gas company, privately reached out to challenge the electric vehicle provisions. Hours before Jonlin yanked the proposal, Thomas Schultz, a technical services analyst at Spire, emailed a consultant named Shaunna Mozingo to complain that the electric vehicle measure did not belong in the code. She, in turn, forwarded the email to Jonlin, who also serves as an energy code adviser to the city of Seattle. By that afternoon, Jonlin told committee members he had “made an executive decision” to remove the electric vehicle requirements from the code. In an interview last week, Jonlin told HuffPost he now planned to reverse that decision. But it’s still early in the process of writing the codes set to debut in 2024, and advocates say the about-face came with no guarantees that the electric vehicle policy won’t be nixed again in the months to come. Reached by phone, Schultz declined to comment. Mozingo confirmed in a voicemail that she sent the email. The incident ― wonky and soporific as it may seem ― highlights serious challenges for the nation’s energy codes at a moment when Americans struggle to afford rising utility bills and scientists warn that anything short of a revolutionary overhaul of energy systems threatens climate catastrophe. In its latest assessment of the world’s best peer-reviewed research, the United Nations’ climate science panel on Monday found global warming was happening with greater speed and intensity than previously understood, but singled out new housing construction as an “opportunity” to respond at scale to the crisis. Meanwhile, each new building constructed to older, less climate-friendly standards adds more carbon to the atmosphere and increases the total cost of decarbonization, since those structures will eventually need retrofits that cost far more to add later. And even with nearly 500,000 electric vehicles sold in the U.S. last year, the Biden administration has struggled to marshal the federal funding to provide the charging infrastructure required to make battery-powered cars competitive with incumbent models that benefit from the nation’s nearly 117,000 gas stations. “The new process gives outside power to the gas utility industry, which has a vested interest in the indefinite sales of fossil fuels,” said Charlie Spatz, a researcher with the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute who filed the public records request for Jonlin’s emails. “​​The gutting of the energy code-making process has provided the fossil fuel industry with an even larger megaphone, leaving committee chairs in a challenging situation.” Tailpipes and smokestacks have long served as the symbols of climate destruction, and with good reason: Traditional cars, gas- and coal-fired power plants, and factories are, in that order, the three largest sources of carbon emissions in the U.S., comprising 77% of the country’s output in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In fourth-place are homes and businesses, whose gas stovetops, oil furnaces and other fossil-fueled appliances comprise another 13%. But those are just greenhouse gases specific to buildings; counting the portion of power plant pollution from buildings’ energy use brings that figure up to nearly 40%. The United States’ sheer size and its federalized system of government severely limit the power cities and towns wield over the nation’s auto fleet, electricity system and manufacturing sector. But mayors, city councils and county officials hold tremendous sway over what kinds of houses, apartments, offices and storefronts developers can build within their jurisdictions. So when cities and towns pledge to slash their climate-changing emissions to reduce local air pollution and do their part to keep global warming from exceeding a catastrophic 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial averages, buildings are some of the few pollution sources they can meaningfully reduce. Building codes are incredibly complex and technical, and few municipalities have the resources to write their own. Likewise, the building industry, from contractors to material manufacturers, needs some uniformity in standards. Enter the ICC, which every three years updates a generic set of building codes that every state and some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean legally recognize as the standard. For years, the ICC convened industry groups, governments and environmentalists to hash out what should be in the latest version of the code. Then the government bureaucrats charged with enforcing the codes would vote on the final version. In 2019, however, the normally sleepy process was jolted when droves of U.S. cities ― frustrated by the paltry efficiency gains over the last few code cycles ― organized to vote in favor of measures to drastically ramp up the version of the energy code that took effect last year. It was an overwhelming success. The 2018 code improved efficiency by barely 1%. By contrast, the 2021 code they approved the next year increased efficiency by up to 14%, promising reductions of as much as 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030, equal to shutting down 47 coal-fired power plants. Industry groups immediately cried foul. The National Association of Home Builders and the Leading Builders of America, which had long held power over the ICC behind closed doors, challenged the legitimacy of the election, claiming that many of the government officials who cast ballots were ineligible to vote. The protest failed. But the American Gas Association, a trade group for natural gas utilities, appealed five of the provisions that voters had overwhelmingly approved. The ICC’s three-member appeals board overturned all five, including ones making it easier and cheaper for homeowners to use electric water heaters and electric vehicles. Of more than two dozen appeals filed by industry groups in total, those were the only ones granted. The ICC, in a move that puzzled many longtime observers, then proposed ending all future elections and switching to a committee-consensus model that gives governments and industry equal representation. The consortium said more than two-thirds of jurisdictions were operating under old versions of the code, so creating a more balanced approach was key to increasing adoption of the latest mandates. Yet the change drew fierce protest from local governments, environmentalists and architects. The Biden administration’s Department of Energy warned the ICC that ending voting would “be detrimental to an appropriate process with appropriate transparency” and stunt “important economic and environmental benefits at the local level.” Unfazed, the ICC announced the change in March 2021 anyway. The American Public Gas Association, another trade group representing gas utilities, told its board of directors the new system “should be beneficial,” according to an internal document HuffPost first published last year. It took the ICC four months to appoint members to the two committees writing the 2024 energy codes for commercial and residential buildings, which it is expected to finalize next spring. The consortium still has yet to name anyone to an independent third committee that is supposed to help dictate the speed at which codes slash carbon emissions. That separate body, which the ICC said will be constituted by early summer, is critical. When the ICC appeals board gutted some of the 2021 code’s biggest climate measures at gas utilities’ behest, it justified the decision by stating that the energy code could only include provisions that saved energy, such as insulation or modern light fixtures. Parts of the code that served primarily to aid the energy transition, by contrast, belonged in the appendix, where some cities and states could choose to adopt or ignore provisions seen as more political in a country where many still dismiss the reality of climate science. But 60% of states don’t allow cities and towns to adopt codes that differ from those used statewide, meaning the appendices are only available to a small fraction of U.S. municipalities. Squeezed for time and worried it would just be removed from the code at a later point, Jonlin ― a liberal longtime advocate of cutting emissions, who had opposed eliminating the government vote ― said he turned down the electric vehicle proposal out of fear that industry would successfully contest it anyway. “My big concern is that we not waste time,” he said by phone. “I want to make sure we don’t get to the end of the process and then have a challenge that then overrules us and then we have to do it over. That’s my big motivator: to make sure we’re doing it right the first time given the extremely limited time.” But the decision riled the committee, which ― lacking the as-yet-unnamed climate panel to refer to ― asked the ICC staff for advice. An ICC employee last week delivered a surprise verdict, telling the committee in a memo that the electric vehicle proposal could, in his opinion, be part of the code. “I’m going to reverse course,” Jonlin said. “We can have it the way it was originally.” “The gutting of the energy code-making process has provided the fossil fuel industry with an even larger megaphone, leaving committee chairs in a challenging situation.” Ryan Colker, a vice president at the ICC, said the incident illustrates that the new, bureaucratic way of writing the energy codes is working. “In this case, the new consensus process actually did what it was supposed to do,” he said by phone. “It brought light to an objection from someone, which then resulted in conversations within the committee and a resolution that ultimately allowed the committee to continue its deliberation and decide the best approach moving forward.” But the issue isn’t resolved, said Kim Cheslak, the director of codes at the New Buildings Institute and a member of the commercial committee. Jonlin put the electric vehicle proposal back into the code on the advice of an ICC staffer who does not speak on behalf of the all-powerful appeals board, which struck down similar policies during the last code cycle. She fears that could easily happen again. “It’s just one staffer’s opinion,” she said. “It’s not worth the paper it’s written on if the board can just overturn it anyway.” The two committees are currently reviewing 450 separate proposals, with plans to complete drafts of the codes by this June. Later this summer, the ICC will make the proposed codes available for public comment. The entire process aims to wrap up by the start of summer 2023. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

0,"Koalas, Other Wildlife Drowned And Battered By Australia's Flood Disaster",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Wildlife groups in eastern Australia are gravely concerned for animals as catastrophic floods sweep through the region, leaving many critters waterlogged, injured, stranded or without food. At least 14 people have died after torrential rain unleashed devastating flash floods in the states of Queensland and New South Wales over the past week. Thousands of others are homeless, without power or trapped in regions cut off by floodwaters, and more storms are still forecast to hit some areas. Many communities further south around Sydney were placed under evacuation orders Thursday. As floodwaters in some areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales start to recede, wildlife rescue groups are starting to field calls about animals affected by the disaster. Many vets and local rescuers have been flooded themselves, leaving limited sources to provide aid. In the northern New South Wales city of Lismore — which experienced its worst flood event in history this week, with water engulfing entire homes — a local volunteer for the WIRES wildlife rescue group said she was concerned that many small mammals like echidnas did not survive. “Unfortunately, it’s a really bad time of the year for echidnas because they’ve got all their puggles in burrows,” WIRES staffer Leoni Byron Jackson said. “So those areas have gone underwater. Those babies have drowned.” She said one woman had contacted her after finding an echidna clinging to a power pole ― a rare sight for the ground-dwelling animal ― while she was evacuating with her family. They were able to save it, bringing it with them to higher ground and releasing it. “Extreme weather events like the current floods can result in stress and shock for wildlife, with birds frequently most impacted as they become waterlogged and unable to fly,” a WIRES spokesperson told HuffPost. “Seabirds and young sea turtles can also be swept off course and found exhausted on beaches or sometimes many kilometers inland.” Wallabies, birds, bandicoots, koalas, kangaroos and their young are among the animals that have been reported as hurt, stranded, or needing to be rescued to WIRES, which is responding in both flood-hit states. Rescuers expect call volumes to keep going up as waters recede and communities begin to pick up the pieces. The greater impact, however, is still hard to predict. “It’s a bit like what happened with the fires because we’ve never seen anything as bad before,” the WIRES spokesperson said in a phone call. A representative for Queensland’s Department of Environment and Science said assessments were taking place across national parks and facilities to determine the extent of the damage. Its New South Wales counterpart said the situation was still unfolding. In the Sunshine Coast region of Queensland, a local woman made the news for reviving a seemingly lifeless platypus that she found washed up near a bridge. “I just kind of dropped in the knees and I don’t even know why I did it,” Mary Valley resident Lady Penelope told HuffPost. “I think I was just so over the loss, you know? And I just started doing those little two finger compressions they teach to do on babies that aren’t breathing. And much to my surprise, it just like sputtered and coughed and something came out its mouth and it started breathing.” “I had a few happy tears and just sat down in the mud beside it.” After about 10 minutes, “It sort of looked at me and blinked its eyes and then just walked back to the water,” she said. The Gold Coast’s Currumbin Wildlife Hospital said Thursday it had been inundated with animals and had admitted more than 100 in just a few days. Dr. Chris Brown, a well-known Australian vet and television host, said ground-dwelling animals like lizards, echidnas and snakes would struggle the most, though possums and birds were also being flooded out of tree hollows, and koala joeys separated from their mothers. “Our wildlife have been through a lot over the last 4 years so let’s hope they can find a way through this challenge,” he wrote on Instagram. In recent years, Australia has faced droughts, heatwaves, the devastating 2019-2020 wildfires, and now historic flooding. Climate scientists say these extreme weather events will become more likely as climate change worsens. For wildlife that survives the floodwaters, the dangers are still real. The risks include car trauma (when dazed animals cross roads), hypothermia, or malnutrition from loss of food sources and habitat. Brisbane-based wildlife group The Rescue Collective said one local rescuer had saved 13 koalas from floodwaters in three days. The iconic animals were listed as endangered earlier this year amid plummeting populations, due to climate change and habitat loss. Tens of thousands of koalas were hurt or killed in the catastrophic bushfires two years ago. Other footage from the Queensland capital city, Brisbane, showed a man swimming down a suburban street supporting a wallaby struggling to swim in deep water. People who come across wildlife in floodwaters are instructed to contact vets, wildlife hospitals and rescue groups like WIRES. If safe to do so, rescuers suggest drying the animal with a towel, wrapping it in fabric to keep it warm, and placing it in a clean, covered box in a dark place while waiting for help to arrive. Putting out boxes and towels can also provide shelter for animals that have fled to higher ground. A post shared by ABC Brisbane (@abcbrisbane) The longer-term impact of the flooding will be especially apparent in coastal waters, according to Richard Leck, WWF-Australia’s head of oceans. For marine species, once the significant short-term risks of debris entanglement pass, pollution issues remain for many years. The far-reaching effects can cause changes in species’ distributions, damage to reefs, and population decline for marine life. In Moreton Bay, a rich habitat for marine species northeast of Brisbane, “We’ve seen massive sediment pollution washing from the catchments that will smother seagrasses for foraging food for species like turtles and dugongs,” Leck said. Dugongs are likely to move further offshore, “but research has found that turtles, they tend not to move,” Leck said. “It will be probably in six to 12 months ... you will start to see really significant impact on turtle species because they’ll simply not have enough food to eat.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,"Biden Says Energy Plan Will Fight Climate Change, Inflation In State Of The Union Speech",environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Senior Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden honed a pragmatic new message on climate change in his first State of the Union speech Tuesday evening, recasting his sweeping proposal to spend more than any country ever has on clean energy as a way to simultaneously combat the rise in U.S. planet-heating emissions and inflation. Biden promised that fighting climate change would translate into an average $500 per year in energy savings for American households. The figure came from an October analysis by the Rhodium Group, a widely respected consultancy. As he’s done repeatedly throughout his first year in office, Biden emphasized that he views confronting climate change as an opportunity to create high-wage jobs in renewable energy and manufacturing, and set the United States up to compete directly with China. He pledged to build out 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations and replace lead pipes as part of 4,000 infrastructure projects the president said were already underway. Next he promised to “start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.” “It is never a good bet to bet against the American people,” Biden said. “We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways all across America. And we’ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate change and promote environmental justice.” Biden’s address comes one day after the United Nations released yet another sobering climate change report, which concludes that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than previously known and that the window to “secure a livable and sustainable future” is rapidly closing. “Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your home and your businesses to be energy efficient and get a tax credit,” Biden said. “Double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind and so much more. Lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month that you’re not going to have to pay at the pump.” Inflation, he said, is “robbing” Americans. “One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I think I have a better plan to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages. That means make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. Instead of relying on foreign supply chains — let’s make it in America.” With Russia financing its war in Ukraine with oil wealth and in the wake of scientists’ latest grim climate warning, Biden finds himself under enormous pressure to take one of two very different paths: lean into fossil fuels or move as quickly as possible toward renewable energy. Republicans argue now is the time to increase domestic production of the fossil fuels that are driving global warming. They have attempted to pin the blame for Russian President Vladmir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Biden, accusing him of financing Putin’s war by importing Russian oil, and are citing the ongoing conflict to justify more drilling at home. Ahead of the president’s speech Tuesday, House Republican leadership held a press conference where they slammed Biden for waging what they called a “war on American energy independence.” At the event, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) produced a printed list of immediate steps Biden should take to correct course, including ending a pause on new federal oil and gas leasing and permitting and fast-tracking natural gas export permits. The list is strikingly similar to one that the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest U.S. trade association, sent to the Whtie House on Tuesday. Meanwhile, climate and environmental groups are accusing Biden of not moving fast enough to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from polluting energy sources. In a press call earlier this week, members of the Build Back Fossil Free coalition called on the president to declare a climate emergency and use his executive authority to halt new fossil fuel projects. And climate group Evergreen Action published a report detailing six actions they want Biden to take to combat climate change, including regulating pollution from the power sector, investing in clean energy manufacturing and phasing out fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters.

2,14 Takeaways From The Latest U.N. Study On Climate Change’s Deadly Toll,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Environment Reporter, HuffPost Pollution-fueled climate change has already irreversibly damaged civilization and nature alike, and, while cities have begun to fortify themselves, the catastrophic new temperatures the planet is on track to reach in the coming decades will render much of that adaptation futile. That’s the alarming finding of the United Nations’ latest temperature-check on global warming. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s premier climate research body, provides a sweeping analysis of climate impacts and vulnerability, a summary of which was released Monday, asserting that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than past U.N. assessments. The conclusions are broadly described and inherently conservative, the result of a consensus process between 270 top scientists from 67 countries whose competing political interests are perhaps best illustrated by the omission of clear language about such issues as fossil fuels, nuclear power, carbon dioxide removal technology and methane gas. A study from another of the IPCC’s working groups, focusing on solutions, is due out next month, and will likely tackle more of those thorny topics. But the report emphasizes what millions of people can already intuit from dramatic shifts in weather patterns: Ways of life that sustained generations are coming to an abrupt and chaotic end, causing great suffering that world governments’ responses so far have proven woefully inadequate to ease, much less reverse. “We simultaneously need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to reduce the risks of climate change and address losses and damages that are already being experienced,” Adelle Thomas, an author of the report and researcher at the University of Bahamas, said in a call with reporters. “And we have a very limited amount of time to do this.” The effects of warming have already spread deadly diseases and increased mental illnesses. A mass exodus has begun as people in every region of the globe flee homes made inhospitable by climate change, with small island nations hit hardest. Drought and flooding is driving food insecurity and malnutrition in Africa, Central and South America. Ecosystems on every continent, in every topography, and in all oceans have experienced changes in structure and locations where animals and plants live as a result of warming that the report’s authors can attribute to warming with high degrees of certainty. There are myriad ways human societies can change to bend the curve of warming, including more nature conservation, a rapid shift to zero-carbon energy sources, and near-infinitely more financial resources devoted to cutting the output of planet-heating gasses and distributed far more widely among the world’s almost 8 billion people. But so far, “lack of funding, lack of political capacity and governance, [and] lack of commitment” have kept the planet on a devastating trajectory, said William Solecki, a co-author of the report and geographer at the City University of New York’s Hunter College. “The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,” the report’s summary concludes. “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.” Here are some of the key takeaways from the new report: What was long treated as a far-off threat is now a tangible part of life on Earth. Rising seas are swallowing low-lying islands and inundating coastal communities. Excessive drought is causing water shortages in the U.S. Southwest and Africa. Violent storms and heavy rains are wreaking havoc across the globe. And warming ocean waters are causing coral reefs to collapse and fisheries to quickly move toward the poles. Still, nations are dragging their feet when it comes to confronting planetary warming. “Globally, the issue of climate change has become quite well understood and that has increased public awareness,” Solecki said. “That has not translated into significant actions.” In North America, climate misinformation and the politicization of climate science remain ongoing barriers to aggressive climate action, the report notes. As if to serve as an exclamation point to that finding, the U.S. Supreme Court — staffed by a supermajority of right-wing justices, including at least one who questions the science of climate change and has direct family ties to the oil industry — is scheduled to begin hearing a case that could limit the federal government’s ability to regulate carbon emissions. The world has made progress adapting to mounting climate impacts, but researchers found that those efforts have been “fragmented,” “unequally distributed” and largely targeted at dealing with water problems. It’s already far from enough and, once we hit higher temperatures, it’ll be even less helpful. “The earlier the adaptation measures are implemented, the more the world will benefit because the potential to reduce climate risks through adaptation is higher until mid-century,” notes an FAQ released alongside Monday’s report. “At higher levels of warming, the effectiveness of most land- and water-based adaptation options starts declining, and the extent of residual risks increases, as do the chances of future unintended consequences.” In the face of climate disasters, many governments are taking a shortsighted, counterproductive approach to adaptation that not only fails to look holistically at climate impacts over time, but may worsen them. This includes building “inflexible infrastructure that cannot be adjusted easily or affordably” — think new construction projects on waterfronts that, even under optimistic scenarios, are slated to be underwater in the next few decades. It also means fortifying certain parts of cities, for example, while leaving out vulnerable communities “which cannot afford to move or adapt.” Since 2010, more of the world’s population has lived in cities than rural areas. As a result, strategies to hunker down in the face of climate problems — either with more air conditioning on hot days or better planning to deal with water issues — are overwhelmingly geared toward urban places. But that doesn’t mean everyone is covered. As more people come from the countryside to cities looking for work — a trend that is increasing as drought or pests make farming harder — poor newcomers are crowding into unplanned slums on the fringes of urban centers. Think, for example, of Rio de Janeiro’s favelas, where mudslides are a growing risk, or Lagos’ floating Makoko neighborhood, where makeshift homes on stilts face floods and waterborne illness. The report concludes: “There is limited evidence of investment in the informal settlements hosting the most vulnerable urban residents.” The migration from the countryside, meanwhile, leaves many of those who remain in rural areas in even more precarious situations, with even fewer resources coming their way. More so than previous IPCC reports, Monday’s hammers home the relationship between human, ecosystem and climate health. Heat waves and other climate impacts are devastating ecosystems upon which humans rely. And degraded lands and waters can not only negatively impact the health of nearby communities, but further exacerbate planetary warming and other environmental threats. The report finds that “human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent” and “current unsustainable development patterns are increasing exposure of ecosystems and people to climate hazards.” “We need to remember we are part of the nature around us, and not its owners,” said Edwin Castellanos, a report author and climate change researcher at Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. The findings make a clear case for conserving 30 to 50% of all lands and waters around the globe to combat the dual climate and biodiversity crises. “Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development,” reads a summary for policymakers. The Biden administration has set a goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030. Despite climate contrarians’ false claims about carbon dioxide emissions being “good” for food production, current and future climate change poses a monumental threat to food security. Already, climate change has slowed the overall growth of crop productivity, the report finds. Fisheries are suffering due to ocean warming and acidification, and extreme weather and climate events have exposed millions around the globe to food insecurity. Future warming is forecast to exacerbate existing problems by weakening soil health, disrupting pollination and fueling drought, with already vulnerable populations most at risk. “Overall, the picture is stark for food systems,” Rachel Bezner Kerr, a report author and professor at Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, said during a call with reporters. “No one is left unaffected by climate change.” The loss of species is one of the clearest examples of how anthropogenic climate change is already altering the planet in irreversible ways. Of 976 species of plants and animals the researchers examined, 47% suffered local population extinctions linked to climate change, with creatures like the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent, wiped out in Australia’s recent fires and heat waves. “The percentage of local losses is getting high enough to start affecting ecosystem integrity and stability and its own resistance to climate change,” Camille Parmesan, a report author and climate scientist at the University of Plymouth, told reporters. The risk of biodiversity loss only grows with every bit of additional future warming. At 1.5 degrees Celsius, between 3 and 14% of species in terrestrial ecosystems are likely to face “very high risk of extinction,” the report found. Those numbers climb to between 3 to 18% at 2 degrees, 3 to 29% at 3 degrees, and 3 to 39% at 4 degrees. Increased rain has spread toxic bacteria and diarrheal illnesses like cholera, while wildfire smoke and drought-fueled dust in the air has triggered lung and heart diseases. Mental health problems are also on the rise as trauma and depression afflict those who survive extreme weather shocks or lose their livelihoods, homes and cultures. “People are suffering and dying right now from climate change, and we are not seeing an investment to try and make sure we are prepared for an even warmer future,” said Kristie Ebi, a report author and health professor at the University of Washington. In many of the world’s metropoles, the housing supply has failed to keep pace with demand from growing populations, sending costs soaring; increasing homelessness; and spurring unsafe, unplanned and poorly integrated communities. Existing buildings, meanwhile, rely heavily on fossil fuels and waste energy via drafty windows and walls. Perhaps counterintuitively, therein lies a hopeful finding from the report: Cities need more new housing anyway, so building climate-friendly structures dovetails nicely with existing demands. “Continuing rapid growth in urban populations and unmet needs for healthy, decent, affordable and sustainable housing and infrastructure are a global opportunity to integrate inclusive adaptation strategies into development,” the report reads. For years now, the European Union and the United Kingdom have directed billions of dollars in subsidies meant for clean energy toward power plants that burn wood or other plant matter. It spewed carbon into the air, but — the thinking goes — the regrowth of trees or other crops also sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. Now, increasingly, so-called biomass or bioenergy companies that benefited from those subsidies are pushing to expand their menu of government handouts to include ones geared toward systems to permanently pull carbon from the sky, promising that technology to capture CO2 at wood-burning power plants’ smoke stacks will make their operations carbon “negative.” This claim has long been disputed by environmentalists, who say these companies create more pollution than they clear up, and the report seems to show that’s for good reason. The industry and the tree farms it plants to offset emissions are messing with ecosystems that wildlife and local people rely on: “bioenergy, with or without carbon capture and storage, can compound climate-related risks to biodiversity, water and food security, and livelihoods, especially if implemented at large scales, especially in regions with insecure land tenure.” Last summer, the historic drought parching the American West took a huge toll on the hydropower dams that provide a huge chunk of the electricity that keeps the lights on in states like California, Nevada and Utah. At one point in August, the California regulators shut down the 644-megawatt Edward Hyatt hydroelectric power plant after water levels at the Oroville Dam Reservoir plunged to just 24% of capacity. The problem is likely to get worse. Dams can adapt to 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees Celsius, equal to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming, the report states. But at higher levels, protective measures become less effective As warming worsens, societies have honed few substantive strategies to aid the 3.6 billion people globally living in the countryside. But one of the more prescriptive parts of the report offers clear ways to help. One would be cash handouts from governments to give farmers and nomadic people more resources to help themselves in the face of crop failure or livestock deaths. Another is job programs to meet growing climate needs, whether that is planting trees, fortifying infrastructure or guarding forests against loggers. From the study: “Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programmes, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.” It’s no secret that global financing to deal with climate impacts has favored the world’s capitals of capital, whether that’s seawalls in Amsterdam, raised roads in Miami or desalination plants in Abu Dhabi. Money has also flowed disproportionately to highly visible big-ticket engineering projects, in no small part because that cash is usually directed by national or supranational governments, or big global financiers. But more money is needed on the local level, where the vital and underfunded work of maintaining and improving existing infrastructure is done, the report found. “Access to finance is most difficult for city, local and non-state actors and in conditions where governance is fragile,” the report states. The environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth said the U.S. and other rich countries had tried to remove mentions of property losses and damages from climate change from the report. In a statement on Sunday, the group condemned the industrial world — which has spewed the vast majority of cumulative emissions into the atmosphere, with the U.S. contributing the most to the mess — for the “disgrace” of the “cowardly decisions” that “have led us here, to the brink of climate catastrophe.” “Developed countries’ attempts to remove the concept of loss and damage, and the finance for it from the IPCC report, was largely thwarted, but we condemn this resistance by those most responsible for the climate crisis,” Meena Raman, an advocate with Friends of the Earth Malaysia, said in a statement. “This has been a shameless attempt to wriggle off the hook.” John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, said the U.N. report “paints a dire picture of the impacts already occurring because of a warmer world and the terrible risks to our planet if we continue to ignore science.” “The question at this point is not whether we can altogether avoid the crisis — it is whether we can avoid the worst consequences,” he said in a statement.

3,PHOTOS: Deadly 'Rain Bomb' Leaves Parts Of Eastern Australia Underwater,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY, Australia ― At least eight people have died after flash floods swept through parts of Australia’s east coast over the weekend and on Monday. Torrential rain lashed the state of Queensland last week and over the weekend, leaving its southeastern regions and parts of the capital city, Brisbane, underwater. Images and videos revealed main roads and homes swallowed by floodwaters, large boats and jetties floating unmoored along the swollen Brisbane River and severe damage to property and vehicles. One video recorded Sunday showed a houseboat colliding with a ferry terminal, then sinking. Onlookers pulled a 70-year-old man who was aboard the houseboat from the water. Although he was uninjured, the boat was destroyed. The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said Monday that up to 18,000 homes had been flooded across the region. Over 1,500 people were in evacuation centers and more than 1,000 schools were closed. Many Brisbane residents also lost power, with energy providers warning it may be days before it was safe to restore it. On Sunday, Palaszczuk called the weather event a “rain bomb,” and described unrelenting “waves of water just coming down.” The disaster is the worst of its kind in a decade for Queensland, which faced destructive flooding in 2011 that left 35 people dead and billions in damage and economic losses. On Monday, the northern New South Wales city of Lismore saw its worst flooding in history, leaving people stranded on their rooftops and prompting close to 1,000 rescue calls when fast-rising floodwaters engulfed homes. “This is a natural disaster of unprecedented proportions,” Stephanie Cooke, the state’s minister for emergency services, said. Australia has been hit with a series of extreme climate events over the past few years, including the 2019-2020 wildfires, drought and now historic floods. “Unfortunately, periods of intense rainfall are becoming more powerful as climate change accelerates. We need urgent, deep emissions cuts this decade to limit warming any further. Every fraction of a degree counts,” the Australian Climate Council said Sunday. The country’s conservative government has been resistant to strong action against climate change and refuses to commit to phasing out coal power. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,Detroit Zoo Moves Birds Inside Over Avian Flu Outbreak In Michigan,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost The Detroit Zoo will be moving most of its birds inside, away from public view, in response to a highly contagious and deadly strain of avian flu identified in Michigan this week. “This is an important preventative measure,” Dr. Ann Duncan, the zoo’s director of animal health, said in a statement. “By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers of [highly pathogenic avian influenza].” The birds being sequestered include flamingos, the more than 20 species living inside the zoo’s “free-flight” aviary, and the peacocks that normally roam the grounds freely. For now, those animals will be housed inside the areas they typically go into to stay warm, Duncan told The Detroit Free Press. One kind of bird that visitors will still be able to see are the penguins, since their living area has its own “air handling system,” the zoo noted. Highly pathogenic avian flu has now been identified in seven states over the past month, including on commercial poultry farms, in backyard flocks of chickens and in wild ducks. Turkey farmers have reported birds dying within hours of apparently becoming infected, according to The New York Times. The United States Department of Agriculture announced on Thursday it had been found in non-commercial and non-poultry flocks of backyard birds Kalamazoo County, Michigan. Those birds were killed “to prevent the spread of disease,” the USDA said. Scientists believe that wild birds may be spreading the illness as they migrate across the country. At the same time, large industrial farms, where thousands of animals are packed into contained spaces, provide the perfect conditions for viruses to run rampant. This strain of bird flu has not jumped to humans and is not considered a risk to human health, though scientists fear the possibility of it mutating. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
11,'My Octopus Teacher' Was Mesmerizing But There's 1 Thing That Deeply Troubled Me,environment," Guest Writer Recently, Jacinta Shackleton, a marine biologist stationed at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, recorded a blanket octopus (the first one was spotted 21 years ago) while snorkeling. I was excited to see photos of the incredibly elusive creature, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what would have happened if someone who watched “My Octopus Teacher,” last year’s well-deserved Oscar-winning documentary, had discovered it. Would they have approached and tried to touch it? When I watched “My Octopus Teacher,” about South African filmmaker and conservationist Craig Foster’s yearlong underwater interactions with an octopus, I was mesmerized by the fantastic footage. As a certified dive master and science teacher, however, I am concerned by the message viewers might take away from the film: that anyone can strap on weights, descend deep, and start touching creatures underwater. I have logged hundreds of underwater hours and I know how rare it is to see an octopus or any other nocturnal sea creature during the day with good enough light to film, let alone see one leave its crevasse and move about freely. Such an experience is certainly worthy of capturing on camera. But as a teacher and human being concerned about our planet, I felt worried. I fell in love with scuba diving when I was in my 20s and I want as many people as possible to experience the thrill of breathing underwater and witnessing creatures that seem like they could only exist in science fiction. However, I also want people to make good choices. Foster claims that he was swimming alone while filming, but it appears to me that he had help. If he was alone, that worries me, as freediving like scuba diving is exponentially riskier when done solo. While wearing weights and diving without training or a partner is dangerous, touching the creatures you encounter is even worse. Dive masters are constantly telling people: “Take only photos, leave only bubbles.” My concern is that most people walk away from watching this masterful film with a renewed desire for closeness with nature, but without a sense of what is appropriate for connection with wild animals. In 1963, the Bronx Zoo had an exhibit called “the Most Dangerous Animal in the World,” and it featured just a mirror. The implication was that human beings can be (and often are) dangerous to the world around them, to each other, and to themselves. We can certainly see this play out underwater. During one of my many dives in Cozumel, a diver was antagonizing a barracuda. We never dove with him again. His behavior was unsafe for him, for the fish and for all of us around him. If you touch a rockfish, stonefish or lionfish, you may come in contact with their venomous quills or spines, and you can be poisoned. If you accidentally scrape your leg or arm on coral, you may get coral stuck in the wound, and some types of coral are toxic. What’s more, coral is fragile, and touching or standing on it can kill it (unfortunately coral reefs are currently facing many human-caused threats). I have seen people stick their camera and fingers into a coral head or small cave to get a better photo of an eel. If an eel bites you, it cannot release its second set of jaws, called the pharyngeal jaws. Someone will have to kill the eel to remove it from you. On the street or the beach, if someone’s dog runs up to you, you ask the owner if their pet is friendly. You ask for permission to approach or touch. When I was walking in the Canadian wilderness with tour operator Churchill Wild to see wolves and polar bears, there was a 9-year-old in our group. At one point, he crouched down ― something we had been given specific instructions not to do ― and the wolf closest to us immediately turned toward him. All of the adults quickly moved in front of the child and he stood up. Thankfully, nothing happened to him. It was a frightening and powerful reminder that when we are out of our normal habitat, we humans may not understand ― and therefore abide by ― all the rules, even if we think we know them. Sometimes humans and wildlife merge and evolve together in unexpected ways. Years ago, many people who fish in Grand Cayman began to clean their catch in one spot and the stingrays around the island came for the free lunch. Now, the area is known as Stingray City, a tourist destination where people can see and swim with many stingrays in one place. A similar thing happened in Oslob, Cebu, in the Philippines, where the whale sharks were following the fishing boats. People on the boats threw krill in the direction of the sharks and someone saw it on YouTube. Then the tourists came. When I was there, a marine biologist gave us instructions to stay 9 feet from the school bus-sized creatures. However, no one gave this memo to the whale sharks. When humans and wildlife come together ― no matter how beautiful or exciting it may seem ― we still need to remember that these creatures are wild and that we need to respect that, so we don’t hurt them or their habitat (and so we don’t get hurt, either). Our natural world needs our help. While I believe “My Octopus Teacher” has brought the wonder of the oceans and their creatures to millions of people, I am still troubled by the promotion of the idea that it’s safe to enter the private world of another creature (especially by yourself) and touch it without consent. I’m not claiming that Foster is or ever would suggest that anyone do what he did, but impressionable viewers may not be able to separate his actions from their own, and that could be trouble for everyone involved. Foster makes clear that his connection with the octopus heals him, and after months of staying at home due to COVID, most of us are searching to renew our relationships with ourselves, each other, and the natural world. But we need to do this with care and caution. We need to put the well-being of these creatures before our own desires. And we need to remember that what happens in a movie ― even a documentary ― isn’t permission to do it ourselves. I hope that everyone who loved this film will find a way to care for our planet’s ocean environments by supporting the establishment of more marine protected areas, reducing plastic, picking up trash, and being kind to the incredible marine animals and environments we might encounter. Sometimes the best way to be kind to them is to leave them alone ― to be satisfied with the gift of a glimpse of their beauty and nothing more. As Shackleton recently reminded us, there are many creatures still being discovered and nearly 80% of our underwater world is yet unmapped. I hope this recent sighting of the blanket octopus and “My Octopus Teacher” inspires many others to explore. There are terrific adventures to be found all over our planet, but we need to participate in ways that keep both us and the creatures we encounter safe from harm.

12,Biden's Offshore Wind Sale Brings In Record $4.3 Billion,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration’s first offshore wind lease sale raked in an astonishing $4.37 billion in high bids — more than any offshore energy auction in U.S. history, including all oil and gas lease sales. The record sale, which the Interior Department announced Friday, offered up six tracts totaling more than 488,000 acres in New York Bight, the waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast. The Biden administration called the blockbuster turnout a “major milestone” toward achieving its goal of securing 30 gigawatts, or 30,000 megawatts, of wind energy by 2030, enough to power 10 million homes for a year and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. “This week’s offshore wind sale makes one thing clear: the enthusiasm for the clean energy economy is undeniable and it’s here to stay,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “The investments we are seeing today will play an important role in delivering on the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to tackle the climate crisis and create thousands of good-paying, union jobs across the nation.” When the auction closed Friday, the average price per acre stood at nearly $9,000. The largest tract of more than 125,000 acres sold to Bight Wind Holdings, LLC for $1.1 billion. The renewable energy auction dwarfs recent offshore oil and gas lease sales, including one in November when 33 companies paid a total of $191 million for rights to drill for fossil fuels across more than 1.7 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge has since vacated those leases, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held its massive auction. The Interior Department estimates that the areas auctioned off in New York Bight have the potential to support wind farms that power up to 2 million homes. Ali Zaidi, deputy White House national climate adviser, called the wind lease sale “a big step towards cleaner electricity and a stronger domestic energy sector.” “President Biden has long seen the opportunity embedded in taking on the climate crisis ― and we are chasing after that opportunity,” he said in a statement. “We have the chance to breathe life into idled ports, revitalize our industrial base, and build products here in America to harness the wind and sun.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,Oil-Backed Republicans Blame Biden’s Energy Policies For Russian Invasion,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Republicans, including some of the biggest recipients of fossil fuel campaign donations, are blaming Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden’s energy policies, citing the crisis to justify more oil and gas drilling at home. In an interview Thursday with right-wing news outlet Newsmax, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said Putin and other world leaders have “watched Joe Biden as he’s made decisions like stopping the Keystone [XL pipeline], ending drilling on federal lands — things that really hindered the U.S.” “Vladimir Putin said, ‘Joe Biden is weak. I am going to move forward,’” said Blackburn, who has received more than $800,000 in oil and gas industry donations over her career. Putting aside that the senator’s comments sound like someone with a direct line to the war-hungry Russian president, there is nothing to indicate that Biden’s energy agenda — specifically, revoking a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline or pausing new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters — motivated Putin to attack Ukraine. Beyond that, any claim that Biden has “ended” federal fossil fuel drilling in the U.S. is simply false. The administration recently paused new federal leasing and permitting in response to a Trump-appointed judge’s ruling that blocked the administration from using a higher calculation for the damages associated with planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans have embraced the talking points as part of a broader partisan effort to place the responsibility for Russia’s attack at Biden’s feet. That effort has primarily consisted of vague attacks painting Biden as “weak” and ignored actions the administration has taken to try to ease soaring energy costs, including appealing to both U.S. drillers and other oil-rich nations to increase production. He’s also signaled that he’s considering releasing more oil from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve and temporarily suspending the federal gas tax. Biden “shuts down American energy production” — he hasn’t done that — “and greenlights Russian energy production,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said during a speech Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Orlando, Florida. “Is it any wonder that Vladamir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do?” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told The Hill that for America to maintain its status as a diplomatic and military power, it has to be a fossil-fuel-producing economic power. “It’s all connected,” she said, “and President Joe Biden is undermining it all with his radical agenda to shut down American energy and embolden our enemies like Russia.” In a series of Tweets, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) argued that Putin was “empowered and emboldened by Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and his approval of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline while killing America’s Keystone XL pipeline.” The White House maintains that Biden has always opposed Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion pipeline that runs between Russia and Germany but is not yet operational. But last year he waived sanctions against the company behind the project, citing a desire not to negatively impact ally Germany. The administration reversed course earlier this week in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, sanctioning both the company, named Nord Stream 2 AG, and its corporate executives. Hawley, McMorris Rodgers and Daines have received $289,000, $767,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, from the oil and gas industry over their careers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics data. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) offered the most conspiratorial interpretation of the ongoing conflict, suggesting that Biden sparked the war intentionally via his energy and climate policies. “It feels planned to me,” she told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. On one hand, Biden blocked the crucial Keystone XL Pipeline, signaling to the world that American energy independence is no longer a priority.On the other hand, he green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, strengthening Russia’s energy hold on Europe. pic.twitter.com/mhkBwBas8g The same Republicans are using the crisis to push for more domestic oil and gas production, though that would do little, if anything, to deter Russia’s attack on Ukraine or provide immediate relief at the pump. In a video posted to Twitter, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) called on the White House and Congress to “immediately unleash our full energy production capabilities” and increase exports of liquified natural gas. The fossil fuel industry is a top-five contributor of Boebert’s, and oil and gas company Terra Energy pays Boebert’s husband nearly half a million dollars per year. As Russia launched its war on Thursday, Noem posted a list of six actions that argued “a strong American President” would immediately take. Five of them targeted boosting domestic fossil fuel production and negatively impacting Russia’s energy sector. The list mirrors one that the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s largest trade association, posted to its Twitter profile Wednesday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked during a press conference Thursday whether Biden would consider lifting restrictions on domestic energy production or review his decision on Keystone XL in light of the Ukraine crisis. “First of all, the Keystone Pipeline is not flowing, so I’m not sure how that would solve anything,” Psaki said. “There’s also plenty of oil leases that are not being tapped into by oil companies, so you should talk to them about that and why.” Biden has acknowledged that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could impact the U.S. economy and stressed that U.S. fossil fuel producers “should not ― should not ― exploit this moment to heighten their prices to raise profits.” “I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting,” Biden said during a Thursday press conference. “I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Kristi Noem as the governor of North Dakota. She is the governor of South Dakota. Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

14,500-Pound Bear 'Hank The Tank' Gets Reprieve Following New DNA Evidence,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A 500-pound black bear accused of breaking into 28 homes in South Lake Tahoe, California, was wrongfully implicated in at least some of the incidents. New DNA evidence shows that the bear, who has become widely known as “Hank the Tank,” is just one of multiple food-seeking bears involved in break-ins in the wealthy neighborhood of Tahoe Keys. “While recent incidents of bears invading homes were originally thought to be a single bear, DNA evidence collected from the most recent incident as well as prior incidents over the past several months prove that at least three bears were responsible for breaking into numerous residences,” the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement. Previously, officials were trying to catch Hank and were considering relocating or even killing him, a move the department previously told HuffPost would be a “last resort.” The possibility of Hank’s execution drew backlash both locally ― most notably from local bear advocacy group BEAR League ― and nationally as his fame grew and he gained fans. my allegiance lies with Hank the Tank pic.twitter.com/tF0QwC01f7 Now the department is modifying its strategy. “CDFW will work in coming weeks and months to trap bears in the South Lake Tahoe area, tag them, collect evidence for genetic analysis, and then release them into suitable habitat,” the department said. The statement added, “CDFW is not going to euthanize any bears that are trapped during this effort.” The department also urged people in the area to take more precautions when dealing with food and trash, noting that “improperly stored human food and trash are likely attracting bears into this neighborhood.” The BEAR League celebrated the news, speculating on social media that Hank had been “taking the rap” for all the break-ins, “probably due to his size” and “extreme handsomeness.” However, The Sacramento Bee reported that there’s still a possibility that one or more bears in the area ― including Hank ― could wind up dead. That’s because in California, homeowners who have had bear trouble can request a permit for a bear trap on their property. If the trap catches a bear and DNA evidence shows it’s the same bear that caused damage the first time, the bear could be killed. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
15,‘Baby Boot Camp’ Exercises Critically Endangered Orangutan,environment," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The 2-month-old critically endangered orangutan, still so tiny that infant-sized diapers hung loosely in front of his belly, clung tightly to a caretaker’s fingers as she lifted him gently from her lap. Roux, born Christmas Eve 2021, needs to get strong enough to hold onto his mother 24 hours a day ― and 12-year-old Menari is the “wild child” of the Audubon Zoo’s orangutans, said Kelsey Forbes, the assistant curator of primates. “She is our biggest acrobat — a little bit crazy,” Forbes said Tuesday. So every day, Roux gets multiple sessions of “baby boot camp” including pullups to strengthen his grip and arms. The zoo’s Sumatran orangutans, like the other two orangutan species, are considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Illegal hunting and loss and fragmentation of the forests where they live are major reasons that their numbers are falling in the wild. So Roux is an important baby. He and his two half-sisters — Madu, born Feb. 28, 2021, and Bulan, born in July 2019 — make up one-third of all orangutans born since the start of 2019 as part of the Orangutan Species Survival Program. Three were born in 2019, one in 2020, three in 2021 and two so far this year, program spokesperson Angela Selzer said Thursday. One other baby, born this year at the San Diego Zoo, was a Sumatran orangutan; the other five were Bornean. It’s the caretakers who do most of the pulling for Roux, lifting him up and down as he grips their thumbs or fingers. But Roux also sometimes pulls himself up as he hangs between their hands. Strength isn’t the only thing he needs to be reunited with Menari, Forbes and curator Liz Wilson said Tuesday. He’s drinking 80 to 90 milliliters (2.7 to 3 ounces) of formula every 3.5 hours. Caretakers want to reduce the number of night feedings, Forbes said. “Orangutans are primarily sleeping from sundown to sunrise. We want to be able to mimic that as much as possible,” she said. And there’s another bit of training, in case Menari, a first-time mother, isn’t producing enough milk — the problem that left her baby so weak he needed constant medical care for a month. He needs to be able to drink an entire bottle poked through the den’s mesh. When he was first taken from Menari, Roux — who wasn’t yet named — couldn’t even suckle, said Forbes. He was fed through a skinny tube inserted through his nose to his stomach, and his caretakers’ duties included making sure he didn’t pick or pull at it. An expert from Children’s Hospital New Orleans taught the staff “tricks and tips” that included massaging the baby’s palate and gums before each feeding, Forbes said. “He took to it fantastically,” Forbes said. His weight rose from 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) to 5.6 pounds (2.54 kilograms) as of Thursday. Though a full-term baby, he started a bit underweight, possibly because he was a twin, Forbes said Thursday. The other baby was stillborn. He spends much of the day with a caretaker in indoor areas, including a den bedroom, where the older animals can see him but not get close. They come in from their big outdoor yard to watch, Forbes said. “They like it when he makes noises. They like during diaper changes. They really like it during feedings,” she said. In the den, he gets to crawl around on various sizes of fire hose and other objects. When the zoo is closed, he gets taken on walks around the zoo, including power-walking and abrupt turns to get him hanging tight. The baby was named this month. His name, pronounced “roo,” is French for reddish brown, the color of an orangutan’s long hair, and for the cooked mixture of flour and oil or butter used to thicken gumbo and other foods. His father, Jambi, sired all three of Audubon’s youngsters since coming to New Orleans in 2018 from Hannover, Germany. Bulan, whose mother is the same as Menari’s, constantly follows her half-sister, who plays with her. Forbes says caretakers don’t expect jealousy to be a problem when Roux and his mother are together. “Not at all! We think that Bulan will be excited to have another playmate. Same with Madu!” she said Thursday."

0,"Russia May Be A ‘Big Gas Station,’ But It’s Also A Key Supplier For Clean Energy",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could delay the global shift away from fossil fuels, analysts said Thursday, a perhaps counterintuitive impact of what’s likely to be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The price of crude oil surged to $105 on Thursday for the first time in years, a reflection of Russia’s vast oil and gas exports that are also the source of its modern economic might. Earlier this week, Harvard economist Jason Furman, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, dismissed Russia to The New York Times as “basically a big gas station,” saying the country was “incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas.” Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental group 350.org, said in a tweet on Tuesday that “Russia can only afford to fight because of its oil and gas… so it might be wise to stop using oil and gas now.” But analysts say even if the world magically moved away from fossil fuels, Russia would still remain a big player in the global energy supply chain. That’s because, as E&E News mining reporter Jael Holzman first noted, Russia is a major source of key metals that batteries and clean electricity depend on, such as nickel and aluminum, as well as a top exporter of nuclear reactor technology. “Initially, this could slow the energy transition,” said Julian Kettle, an analyst and senior vice president at the British energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “We can’t pull metal out of the ground fast enough” to produce the renewables needed to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, he added. Russia produces roughly 7% of the world’s mined nickel. However, it generates 20% of the global supply of Class 1 nickel, the grade of the metal most commonly used in lithium-ion batteries to increase how much energy they hold and how long they stay charged. When nickel prices rose about 21% last year, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of the electric auto and battery giant Tesla, called nickel supplies “our biggest concern for scaling” battery production. While electric vehicle sales spiked by more than 80% last year, a “minuscule” number of those cars were powered by no-nickel batteries. On Thursday, the price of nickel climbed to more than $25,000 per ton, the highest it’s been since 2011. “Any sanction leading to an export ban would likely have further impact on the nickel price, which is already at decadelong highs,” said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm that specializes in lithium-ion batteries. Even after the West sanctioned key Russian industries following the invasion of Crimea in 2014, metal producers largely avoided such penalties. There was one notable exception: the aluminum maker Rusal, which the United States sanctioned in 2018 in a bid to punish its billionaire founder, Oleg Deripaska, in connection with Crimea and various other fights with Russia. The sanctions, which were lifted in 2019 when Deripaska relinquished control of the firm, sent the price of aluminum up 35% in a matter of days, according to Reuters. Today Russia supplies around 6% of the world’s aluminum, the price of which shot up to a record high of $3,450 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday. Far more than just the main source of the kitchen foil mainstay, aluminum is so key to building solar panels that a January study in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Sustainability found that solar energy, at its current rate of growth, could eat up half the world’s supply of the metal by 2050. It’s also used to make the high-voltage power lines needed to carry solar and wind energy from where it’s available to where it’s needed. One problem with aluminum is that it normally requires large amounts of fossil fuels to smelt. But even there Russia has an advantage as companies like the Anglo-Russian En+ Group, which has ties to Rusal, build low-carbon smelters in Siberia that use hydropower made increasingly abundant through melting ice. And sanctions, particularly for metals, are not necessarily effective because Russia could redirect its sales to China, which is importing metals to fund its energy transition and could process the raw materials and sell them to buyers in the very countries in the West seeking to limit Russia’s access to markets as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine. Even nuclear energy — the zero-carbon electricity source that skeptics of renewable energy favor — is a key asset for Russia. The nation’s state-owned nuclear company Rosatom became the world’s leading supplier of reactors in 2017, cutting deals to build new plants in countries such as Bangladesh, China and Egypt. ​​ Russia also produces about 2% of the world’s cobalt, the metal used in various battery chemistries, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and Russian mercenaries have played a notable role in developing mining supply chains in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the world’s supply comes from. China still enjoys a near-monopoly on the production of rare earth minerals, a group of 17 metals with unique magnetic properties that make them crucial for making batteries and other electronics. But Russia boasts the fourth-largest known reserves of these minerals. In August 2020, the country announced plans to invest $1.5 billion into boosting the production of rare earth minerals, with an aim of becoming the No. 2 supplier after China by the end of this decade. The Biden administration is seeking to counter its geopolitical rivals’ dominance in the clean energy supply chain. China’s control over flows of lithium and rare earths in particular has become a sticking point that pro-fossil fuel opponents of decarbonization policy have used to argue that reducing use of oil, gas and coal poses risks to the United States’ national security. On Tuesday, the White House announced plans to invest $35 million in the United States’ lone rare earths producer, the California-based miner MP Materials, as part of a plan to increase domestic output of metals needed for decarbonization. “China controls most of the global market in these minerals,” President Joe Biden said in a speech Tuesday. “We can’t build a future that’s made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow.” The same could be said of Russia, if to a lesser degree.

1,UN: More Wildfires Will Scorch The Planet In Coming Decades And Nations Are Not Prepared,environment," BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A warming planet and changes to land use patterns mean more wildfires will scorch large parts of the globe in coming decades, causing spikes in unhealthy smoke pollution and other problems that governments are ill prepared to confront, according to a U.N. report being released Wednesday. The western U.S., northern Siberia, central India, and eastern Australia already are seeing more blazes, and the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires globally could increase more than 50% by the turn of the century, according to the report from the U.N. Environment Program. Areas once considered safe from major fires won’t be immune, including the Arctic, which the report said was “very likely to experience a significant increase in burning.” Tropical forests in Indonesia and the southern Amazon of South America also are likely to see increased wildfires, the report concluded. “Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,” said Andrew Sullivan, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, one of the report’s authors. But U.N. researchers said many nations continue to spend too much time and money fighting fires and not enough trying to prevent them. Land use changes can make the fires worse, such as logging that leaves behind debris that can easily burn and forests that are intentionally ignited to clear land for farming, the report said. In the United States, officials recently unveiled a $50 billion effort to reduce fire risks over the next decade by more aggressively thinning forests around “hot spots” where nature and neighborhoods collide. However, the administration of President Joe Biden has so far identified only a fraction of the funding called for in the plan. The U.N. researchers also called for more awareness of the dangers from smoke inhalation, which can affect tens of millions of people annually as plumes from major wildfires drift thousands of miles across international borders."
2,'The Birds Outsmarted Us': Magpies Work Together To Give Scientists The Slip,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Anyone who’s ever been swooped at by a magpie will be horrified to learn that the birds are working together. A research team in Australia studying a new kind of tracking device for birds was surprised to find that magpies were cooperating to give them the slip. “When we attached tiny, backpack-like tracking devices to five Australian magpies for a pilot study, we didn’t expect to discover an entirely new social behaviour rarely seen in birds,” wrote Dominique Potvin, an animal ecologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast, in an article for The Conversation. “Our goal was to learn more about the movement and social dynamics of these highly intelligent birds, and to test these new, durable and reusable devices. Instead, the birds outsmarted us.” Magpies are a staple in Australian bush and backyards. The iconic birds are known for their warbling calls and territorial but playful nature. Most Aussies ― especially cyclists and runners ― will likely have had some kind of experience with a swooping magpie in their lifetime, as many harrowing but hilarious viral videos have shown. According to Potvin’s research paper, after scientists attached tracking devices to five birds, they began to display what seemed to be altruistic behavior: They would cooperate to help each other remove the trackers. One bird would snap another bird’s harness at the only weak point. They appeared to be helping one another without getting any immediate, tangible reward, Potvin noted, demonstrating both cooperation and problem solving. So it’s back to the drawing board for the team, which needs to find a more effective way of collecting data about the birds. Read more at The Conversation. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Raw Sewage Spill Shuts Down Beaches In Southern California,environment," NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — A stretch of Southern California beach was closed Monday to swimmers and surfers after up to 50,000 gallons (189,270 liters) of raw sewage spilled into nearby waters, authorities said. The Orange County Health Care Agency said a blocked sewer line at a restaurant in Newport Bay caused the leak of untreated sewage, the Los Angeles Times reported. The waters on the west end of the bay will remain closed to swimming, surfing and diving until the results of follow-up water quality monitoring meet acceptable standards, the agency said. This spill comes less than two months after a sewage main in Carson failed, spewing millions of gallons of waste into the Los Angeles Harbor and fouling beaches in Long Beach and elsewhere in LA and Orange counties."
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,U.S. Freezes New Oil And Gas Projects Amid GOP Suit Over Social Cost Of Emissions,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration said Saturday it would suspend any decisions about new oil and gas drilling amid an ongoing legal battle with 10 Republican states over how to calculate the cost of fossil fuel-driven climate change. The decision comes amid a recent court ruling over a government metric known as the “social cost of carbon,” which sets a dollar figure for the climate change-related damage associated with greenhouse gas emissions. That figure was $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted under President Barack Obama, but slashed to just $7 per ton under President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden reinstated the $51 metric when he took office and said the administration would update it further as climate change continues. The figure, as The New York Times notes, is used to guide government decisions on pollution-linked industries, and a higher dollar value in the future could make it harder for new oil and gas projects to move forward. Scientists have long said that fossil fuel emissions need to be drastically reduced as soon as possible to limit the negative effects of climate change, which already cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars a year. A coalition of 10 GOP attorneys general sued the Biden administration after it reverted to the original figure, however, saying the metric unduly targets energy-producing states. A Trump-appointed judge agreed earlier this month, blocking the White House from using the higher cost estimate while saying the $51 figure would “artificially increase the cost estimates of lease sales.” Environmental advocates blasted the ruling as basically a defanging of the nation’s climate policies, and the Department of Justice said it would appeal the decision while it indefinitely paused the rollout of new oil and gas permits. “From President [Richard] Nixon on, every President has imposed some internal Executive Branch requirement for federal agencies to assess the costs and benefits of major government actions,” the DOJ said in a court filing this weekend. “The injunction further calls into question the authority of the past three Administrations to provide standardized guidance to agencies on appropriate methods of estimating the social cost of greenhouse-gas emissions.” The legal jostling is the latest in an ongoing battle between Biden and GOP efforts to limit his climate policies. The president suspended new federal oil and gas leases when he entered the White House and Republican states sued after that move, too. Biden was forced by a federal judge to allow the lease sale to go forward, the largest in U.S. history. Environmentalists said the sale was a ticking “carbon bomb,” but a judge canceled the leases last month, saying the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate impacts when it held the auction. The latest ruling over the social cost of carbon calculation seems to have had a similar effect, at least for now, with the Biden administration saying any new oil and gas permits would be halted as the DOJ assesses “whether and how they can proceed.” The Times notes that the decision has already had an impact in Wyoming, which had hoped to have a lease sale for drilling that could have brought millions of dollars in revenue to the state’s coffers. That sale, for now, won’t go forward as planned. Wyoming was one of the states that filed suit against the metric. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Led Zeppelin Co-founder Leads Stunning New Take On 'When The Levee Breaks',environment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Playing for Change just dropped its latest global musical effort, a fresh new take on “When The Levee Breaks” anchored by Led Zeppelin bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones. The song ― originally recorded by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie nearly a century ago to commemorate the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 ― was the closing track of Zeppelin’s untitled 1971 album, aka “Led Zeppelin IV.” Along with Jones, the new version features Stephen Perkins of Jane’s Addiction, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, along with more than a dozen musicians from seven nations playing remotely: “Looking at ‘When The Levee Breaks’ through the lens of producing a song to raise awareness for key environmental organizations truly felt like a plea for climate justice,” Sebastian Robertson, who plays on the track and co-produced it, told Rolling Stone. “The wailing guitars, harmonica, and vocals all in harmony for Mother Earth.” Playing for Change said proceeds will benefit organizations that promote environmental justice and sustainability including Conservation International, American Rivers, World Wildlife Fund, REVERB and the Playing for Change Foundation. “It seems that little has changed since 1927, or even 2005 with Katrina. It’s still a really powerful track, both musically and lyrically,” Jones said in a statement released by Playing for Change. The track also features Alfredo Arce (siku flute), Ben Lee (harmonica), Buffalo Nichols (vocals and guitar), Davey Chegwidden (dundun drums), Drums of the Pacific (dancing and log drums), Elle Márjá Eira (vocals), Jason Tamba (banjo), Keith Secola (slide guitar), Mermans Mosengo (harmonica), Mihirangi (vocals), Nakeiltha Campbell (dundun drums), Pete Sands (acoustic guitar) and Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum).

12,A Hungry 500-Pound Bear Has Broken Into Nearly 30 Homes In California (UPDATE),environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost UPDATE, 8:38 p.m. EST, Feb. 24 ― California officials initially believed that 28 break-ins in South Lake Tahoe were the work of one 500-pound bear widely known as “Hank the Tank.” But new DNA evidence has cleared him in at least some of the incidents. At least three bears have been breaking into homes, prompting the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to modify its strategy. Read more here. Earlier: A 500-pound black bear has broken into 28 homes and caused significant property damage in a California city, eluding wildlife officials for months. A “special trapping effort” is now underway to catch the hefty male, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced this week. Since summer 2021, the bear has “forcefully entered” houses and caused “extensive property damage” around Tahoe Keys, a wealthy neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe. The bear’s “immense size and strength” make it easy for him to get through both front doors and garage doors, the statement said. There have been more than 150 calls to authorities placed over the bear, according to local news station KCRA. Following reports the bear would be killed if caught, California DFW spokesperson Peter Tira told HuffPost that officials were looking at multiple options and that the bear’s death would a “last resort.” “With regard to when and if it is captured, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is exploring all options, which include placement in an accredited sanctuary or similar facility, relocation and euthanasia, which is always the option of last resort,” Tira said in an email. The bear has many aliases. SFGate reports that residents of Tahoe Keys know him as Jake or Yogi. Local police, however, have taken to calling him “Hank the Tank.” Whatever name you call him, though, the bear is “severely food-habituated,” which means he no longer fears humans and instead associates people with food. This can happen when people either intentionally feed bears, or accidentally leave food out where bears can eat it. Most of the incidents happened in the spring and summer of year, when the bear was in hyperphagia ― a state of constant eating that prepares bears for hibernation, Tira told CNN. But he awoke from hibernation this month and resumed causing mayhem. Jake/Yogi/Hank has not injured any people or pets. And local bear advocacy group BEAR League wants to make sure that no harm comes to him. “The BEAR League reached out to the director of an excellent out-of-state wildlife sanctuary who agreed he has room and would be very willing to give this bear a permanent home,” executive director Ann Bryant told local news station KCRA. She added that the BEAR League had been in touch with state officials about the plan. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
13,At Least 12 Dead After Storm Brings Hurricane-Force Winds To Western Europe,environment," LONDON (AP) — Crews cleared fallen trees and worked to restore power to about 400,000 people in Britain as Western Europe cleaned up Saturday after one of the most damaging storms in years. At least 12 people were killed, many by falling trees, in Ireland, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Named Storm Eunice by the British and Irish weather services, and Storm Zeynep in Germany, Friday’s storm was the second to hit the region in a week. Winds toppled the spire of a church in Wells, southwest England, ripped off parts of the domed roof of London’s O2 Arena and left a trail of felled trees and damaged buildings across several countries. A gust of 122 miles an hour (196 kilometers an hour) was provisionally recorded Friday on the Isle of Wight. If confirmed, it would be the highest ever in England. Hurricane-force winds begin at 74 mph. The Met Office weather service said more strong winds would hit the southern coasts of England and Wales on Saturday, with the potential for further damage, while snow and ice could cause disruption further north. The U.K.’s National Rail association said “routes across most of Great Britain” remained affected by the weather on Saturday morning, with disruptions to continue throughout the day. Transport in Germany also remained severely disrupted, with railway operator Deutsche Bahn saying no long-distance trains would operate north of Dortmund, Hannover and Berlin until at least 6 p.m. The storm left at least three people dead in Germany, including a man who fell as he was trying to repair a damaged roof and a driver whose car crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road. In the northwestern city of Bremen, a 55-meter (180-foot) crane fell onto an unfinished office building. A cleanup also was underway in the Netherlands, where four people died as Eunice tore across the country on Friday. Train services, halted during the storm, remained disrupted with the company responsible for rail infrastructure saying that it was working hard to repair “extensive” damage to tracks and overhead power lines. Engineers were expected to assess damage to the roof of a stadium in The Hague where professional soccer team ADO The Hague plays its home matches after parts of the structure were blown loose. Across the country, teams were shifting fallen trees and beginning to repair roofs damaged by the storm. ___ Michael Corder in The Hague and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this story."
14,The Oil Industry And Its GOP Allies Are Trying To Sink Biden’s Climate-Focused Fed Pick,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senate Republicans launched a scorch-earth attack this week on Sarah Bloom Raskin, the White House’s nominee to be the Federal Reserve’s vice chair of supervision, painting her as a radical for her widely shared view that climate change threatens the global economy. Rather than voting no at Tuesday’s planned vote on whether to advance Raskin and two other Fed nominees to the full Senate, the 12 Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee staged a boycott, denying the panel’s Democratic majority the quorum needed to take that procedural step. On Wednesday, 10 more GOP senators called on the White House to withdraw Raskin’s nomination, describing her as an “activist” bent on “manipulating markets” in ways that “will harm all Americans” in a letter, a copy of which HuffPost obtained. If confirmed, Raskin, 60, would become one of the world’s most powerful bank regulators. The role was created after the Great Recession to guard against future financial meltdowns, and though the financial industry largely welcomed the nomination of a seasoned and familiar regulator who previously served as deputy treasury secretary and on the Fed’s board of governors, it’s the oil and gas industry that’s fueling the Republican assault. Raskin, who is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), entered the industry’s crosshairs in March 2020, when, in testimony before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, she called for new federal rules requiring investors to disclose the risk that climate change poses to assets. She then urged U.S. regulators to carry out the kind of climate “stress tests” ― models to determine how a financial institution’s assets gain or lose value if, for example, a natural disaster upends supply chains or a government policy to cut emissions renders fossil fuel reserves worthless ― that the Bank of England and European Central Bank were already performing. Two months later, she argued in a New York Times opinion piece that the money the Fed was spending to prop up fossil fuel companies amid the pandemic “not only misdirects limited recovery resources but also sends a false price signal to investors about where capital needs to be allocated.” She effectively argued for taking a U-turn on the Trump-era policy. Instead of favoring fossil fuel companies in loans from the Fed, boost energy companies that decarbonize their operations. “Her views are in the mainstream,” said Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, a program under the Ceres green investor advocacy group. “There are over 100 central banks around the world that are part of the Network for Greening the Financial System. They’re all saying climate is a risk. Our current chair of the Federal Reserve says climate is a risk.” Yet while Fed chair Jerome Powell’s statements acknowledge climate change’s financial risks, he has yet to propose any corrective measures as specific as those Raskin has put forward. Climate-concerned progressives lauded her and urged President Joe Biden to name her treasury secretary or, at the very least, as the Treasury Department’s climate czar. But when the White House ultimately named her to the Fed role in January, the industry that stood to suffer the most from the policies she had floated now targeted her as an opponent. Raskin could not implement policy unilaterally as one member of the Fed’s board of governors. In a speech to a conference last summer, she also tempered expectations about what kinds of policies could even work in the U.S., telling a European interviewer that requiring climate-vulnerable companies to keep certain amounts of capital on hand at all times is a concept that “does not have much traction on this side of the pond.” Still, shortly after her nomination last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which for years denied the very reality of climate change, offered a rare rebuke of a Fed nominee, warning in a public letter that Raskin might “direct capital away from certain industries that are politically disfavored or direct capital towards industries that are politically favored.” The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s biggest lobby in the U.S., echoed the sentiment. “We remain concerned about Sarah Bloom Raskin’s past statements regarding the oil and natural gas industry,” Frank Macchiarola, API’s senior vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. “We believe it would be inappropriate to use the Federal Reserve as a mechanism to restrict capital to our sector which could ultimately undermine efforts to deliver affordable and reliable energy while addressing the climate challenge.” The American Energy Alliance, a fossil fuel advocacy group funded by the petrochemical billionaire Charles Koch, accused Raskin of singling out the oil and gas industry because it was “unwoke.” A HuffPost analysis of campaign donation data found that the dozen Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee received more than $8.3 million in combined donations from the oil and gas industry, with an average of nearly $697,000. The senators are Pat Toomey (Pa.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Tim Scott (S.C.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), John Kennedy (La.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Steve Daines (Mont.). The 10 additional senators who signed the letter to the White House include some of the other biggest recipients of oil donations, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.). In the letter, they say that confirming Raskin risked the “potential abuse of power to inflict harm upon the traditional fuel industry.” In a letter of its own, the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Better Markets accused the Republican senators of having “misleadingly cherry-picked and distorted” Raskin’s record. “Ms. Raskin’s actual statements and views on climate align with Fed Chair Powell, former Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randy Quarles, the biggest banks on Wall Street, financial industry leaders, and others,” Dennis Kelleher, Better Markets’ co-founder and president, said in a statement. “While these ideological and, at times, apparently poll-driven political attacks may play well with some base voters, they have no place in what should be a fact-based confirmation process.” The White House declined a HuffPost request to interview Raskin. The oil and gas industry and its legislative allies have in recent years begun parroting the language that social justice activists use to describe discrimination or access to health care. As a growing number of cities require new buildings to install electric appliances and boiler systems, nearly two dozen states have prohibited their municipalities from banning natural gas use for cooking and heating, casting the legislation as protecting consumer choice. Meanwhile, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the right-wing policy shop, in the past year started promoting model bills to state lawmakers banning “discrimination” against fossil fuel companies by requiring state comptrollers and treasurers to withdraw government funds from banks, insurance firms and investment companies that do not invest in fossil fuels. The push coincides with mounting warnings that continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure could create a dangerous financial bubble. In October, the Financial Stability Oversight Council ― the federal entity established as part of the same post-recession Dodd-Frank Act reforms that created the position to which Raskin was nominated ― issued a landmark report on climate change. The document found that global warming poses financial threats on numerous fronts, and, perhaps most jarringly, that the United States’ growing dependence on natural gas for electricity and heat could represent one of the nation’s biggest vulnerabilities. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco warned a year ago that climate change “will result in economic and financial losses for many businesses, households, and governments” and said “the uncertainty about the severity and timing of these losses” was a risk unto itself. In January 2020, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, wrote in its annual letter to CEOs that it would be “increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures.” That July, Citigroup pledged to start measuring companies by their compatibility with the warming scenario outlined in the Paris climate accords. JPMorgan Chase made a similar commitment that October. Raskin’s views on climate are central to the opposition against her. But Toomey, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, accused her of lobbying the Kansas City Fed branch on behalf of a financial tech firm whose board she briefly joined months after leaving the Treasury Department in 2017. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called it evidence of a corrupt “revolving door” deal in which the tech firm, Reserve Trust, hired Raskin to do its bidding. But the story, which Toomey cited to the Kansas City Fed leadership, was quickly disputed. Colorado’s state bank regulator said the Fed branch “misrepresented” the facts of what happened, explaining that Reserve Trust’s successful appeal to be considered a bank by the Fed came after the company changed its business model and won approval from state regulators, not as a result of Raskin’s influence. Reserve Trust’s co-founder wrote in a letter to the editor published in the Journal that Raskin “had no role whatsoever” in gaining the company’s Fed approval. Raskin and other Fed nominees have pledged to wait four years before taking any job with a company that provides financial services. Advocates called the whole “scandal” a sideshow to pad the climate-fueled criticism of Raskin. They also said there was a double standard at play just months after the vice chair and two regional Fed leaders were implicated in an actual ethics scandal in which officials working on the Fed’s pandemic bailout programs traded stocks that benefited from those very policies. The move prompted new ethics rules, unveiled this week. “We are, of course, concerned that Raskin was involved in all-too-common revolving-door work on behalf of a fintech firm,” said Jeff Hauser, founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project. “But after Republicans have ignored a historic Fed scandal… it’s hard to get too worked up about it.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

15,11 Mistakes Tourists Make At National Parks,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Two of the biggest effects of the pandemic on travel have been the emphasis on domestic tourism and the increased interest in outdoor adventures. When you combine those in the U.S., what you get is a newfound appreciation for the stunning national parks. In 2021, the National Parks System reported nearly 300 million recreation visits across all properties, and 44 parks set new visitation records. These high numbers include many first-time parkgoers, who don’t always know how to take advantage of all these stunning destinations have to offer. In fact, many seasoned national park travelers don’t hesitate to point out some of the faux pas they’ve observed from their fellow visitors. We asked some experts to share some of the biggest mistakes they believe travelers make when they visit national parks. Read on for 11 examples, as well as advice for avoiding these common missteps. “A lot of travelers get caught up in the romanticism of spontaneity,” said Heather Gyselman, a product manager for adventure travel at REI. “I get it, who doesn’t want to hit the road without a care in the world? However, when visiting a national park today it’s important that you’ve invested time in planning and organizing your trip.” If you don’t do any advance planning, you might find yourself scrambling as you encounter daily capacity limits, trail and road closures, limited parking and fully booked campgrounds and lodgings. Go to the official website of the national park you want to visit, so you can find this relevant information ahead of time and keep up to date with any changes. Prepare a basic itinerary. “The No. 1 rule is to have a plan,” said Dan Austin, founder and director of special projects at Austin Adventures. “While you can always adjust on the fly, it’s a good idea to plan out the key places you want to see. Once you have that list, review the layout of the park and the road system as it can take all day to get across many of our parks. Add traffic to the mix and it can really get tricky. Having a plan and mapping out everything you want to see can really help with those challenges.” “Don’t limit yourself to the popular or ‘Instagrammable’ spots,” advised Alan Fyall, the Visit Orlando endowed chair of tourism management and associate dean of academic affairs at the University of Central Florida’s Rosen College of Hospitality Management. “Explore the park. Ask a ranger or campground host what they recommend that could be outside the heavily trafficked areas.” There are countless scenic spots that aren’t packed with photo-snapping crowds. Only focusing on the most popular attractions might also keep you from some truly powerful national park experiences. “Most people don’t get far enough away from the parking lots,” said writer and naturalist Janisse Ray. “They do the canned version of our parks, which means they see iconic sights like Old Faithful blowing in a kind of drive-by viewing, but they don’t experience the sense of place or the incredible, life-altering, deeply meaningful spectacles that occur at smaller scales and slower paces.” She encouraged parkgoers who are physically able to get out of the car and go for long walks to immerse themselves in the wilderness. “Stay a while,” Ray said. “Spend some nights. Prepare for your heart to burst open in a way it can’t if you don’t leave your vehicle.” “If you’re looking for lodging inside the parks, book early as reservation space is at a premium ― this includes campgrounds,” Austin said. Even if you are able to book in-park lodging, that might not be your best option. These accommodations are often more expensive than the hotels or short-term rentals in the surrounding area. “Sure, staying overnight at campgrounds or lodges inside the park is cool. Nature is right outside your tent, RV or hotel room,” said Joe Yogerst, author of “50 States, 500 Campgrounds: Where to Go, When to Go, What to See, What to Do.” “But many parks are surrounded by national and state parks with great campgrounds and small communities with outstanding accommodation,” he added. “That means making day trips into the park, but I find that a small inconvenience compared to not going at all.” “In addition to having a plan, I recommend starting very early in the morning,” Austin said. “You’ll beat the traffic and crowds, and it’s prime time for grabbing photographs and spotting wildlife.” National parks tend to be open 24 hours a day, so take advantage of the flexibility. If you traveled out West from the East Coast for your outdoor adventures, don’t let your internal clock adjust to the time change and wake up early instead. “The early bird gets the solitude,” said Andrea Lankford, author of “Ranger Confidential: Living, Working, and Dying in the National Parks.” “Set the alarm and enjoy the serene hours between sunrise and 10:30 a.m.” “National parks are amazing but wild places, so it is essential to practice basic safety while visiting them,” said Will Pattiz, co-founder of More Than Just Parks. “Every year, people die while vacationing in national parks. This is easily avoided by sticking to trails, checking the weather before going out on a hike, maintaining a safe distance from wildlife and avoiding ledges with steep drop-offs.” Lankford cautioned against what she calls “high-altitude selfies,” pointing to the rise in photography-related deaths over the past decade. “Stay back from the cliff edge, put the phone down, and be here now,” she said. And as beautiful the views can be, drive carefully and be mindful of wildlife, pedestrians, bikers and other cars. “Pay attention when in your car,” said Michael Childers, an associate history professor at Colorado State University specializing in the modern American West and the environment. “It is easy to watch a bison frolic and miss that camper stopped in front of you.” “Resist the temptation to do a lot in a short time frame,” Fyall said. “Doing the ‘Mighty 5’ [in Utah] plus the Grand Canyon in a week is something that people commonly inquire about. You are doing yourself and the parks a disservice in trying to ‘park hop.’” Many breathtaking national parks are in relatively close proximity to each other, so it might feel feasible to knock out a bunch in the same trip. But attempting to do this will make the experience more stressful and rushed. Instead, Fyall suggested narrowing the list down to one or two parks per vacation. That way you can devote the proper amount of time to each one and create a less jam-packed itinerary. “Get a feel of the park,” he said. “Go to the same vistas at different times of day, you’d be surprised at the different experiences you could have. The same can be said for trying to do too much in a day.” It’s also better to be flexible at national parks, which is hard if you have a full and stringent itinerary. “If something catches your eye, go check it out,” Fyall said. “If a trailhead is busy or closed, ask a ranger what else you could do or try that trail a different day or time of day.” “Try visiting the most popular parks in the off-season rather than summer,” Yogerst said. “I actually think Yosemite is more gorgeous in winter snow and my best-ever visit to the Grand Canyon was in October.” If you have to do your national parks travel during the summer, he encouraged checking out less-visited parks like Pinnacles in California, Dry Tortugas in Florida, Canyonlands in Utah, Big Bend in Texas and all of the parks in Alaska. The day of the week can make a difference as well. Avoid busy weekends when possible. “See if you can visit on slower days,” Childers said. “Many of our larger parks are being overrun, so if you can go midweek or in the off season to alleviate the pressure and have a much more enjoyable visit.” “One of the biggest mistakes visitors to national parks make is arriving unprepared,” said Riley Mahoney, creator of the website The Parks Expert. “Not bringing enough water, expecting restaurants or other services, or not wearing appropriate shoes are things I notice often on my travels. I’ve seen visitors at parks like Sequoia or Yosemite in December planning to hike or sled but show up wearing sneakers, or sometimes even flip-flops, when there is a foot of snow on the ground.” She noted that some parks have limited water stations, so visitors need to bring a lot with them. Similarly, there are no places to get food or gas within the boundaries of certain parks, such as Joshua Tree. “Visitors should plan to be self-sufficient and pack their patience,” Mahoney noted. Pay attention to the weather forecast and travel with layers so that you can adjust to any big temperature shifts. Prepare for dips in cell service, and pick up a paper map so you have backup navigation. “Bring water if you are going on a hike,” Childers added. “And check the map before you get too far from the trailhead and find out it is beyond your abilities. Oh, and don’t forget the sunscreen.” “National parks are not petting zoos,” Lankford said. “Give park wildlife some personal space, for your sake and theirs.” Visitors have a responsibility to be respectful of the land and creatures that dwell there, so avoid off-limits areas and make sure not to litter. Clean up after your pets as well and be considerate of where you take them. “I love man’s best friend as much as the next guy, but our furry companions are actually not allowed on many national park trails,” said Jim Pattiz, the other co-founder of More Than Just Parks. “This is because, of course, they can have an extremely detrimental effect on native plants and wildlife. The short of it is your Siberian husky should not be chasing lizards in a federally protected area like Saguaro National Park.” A general rule of thumb is that dogs should only go where cars are allowed to go. Pattiz also noted that the use of drones is also prohibited in national parks. “They disturb visitors as well as the wildlife, and can damage the fragile ecosystems our national parks safeguard for us and future generations to enjoy,” he said. You don’t have to figure out your whole park adventure on your own. National park visitor centers are filled with experts happy to share their advice. “Park staff are incredibly helpful and have great suggestions on things to see, park programs and ideas for how to avoid crowds,” said Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation. Talk to a ranger, volunteer or campground host about the trails you’re interested in hiking and your ability level. They have a wealth of knowledge to share. You can also check out the informational videos and exhibits at the visitor centers to learn more about the history and geography of the park. “Be adventurous!” Gyselman urged. “Ask a ranger what their favorite hike is or where you can get away from the crowds. Most of the time these areas require a little more effort, but the payoffs are huge.” She also recommended checking out the many Facebook and Instagram groups where people share national park travel tips and ideas. “Many National Parks also have designated social media pages managed by rangers or park administration,” Gyselman explained. “The posts they create are informative but so are the chats that fellow park lovers start in the comments section. I’ve found all sorts of helpful nuggets in those conversations.” “Don’t limit yourself to just the national park,” Fyall said. “Adjacent and adjoining wilderness areas, monuments, national forests and other designations that fall under the National Park Service are often less crowded, and have equally stunning vistas, making for a fantastic experience.” Driving over to a national forest or other nearby site can offer a break from crowds during your outdoor adventure time. “There are 155 national forests in America, many of which are equally as beautiful as the national parks they neighbor and only see a fraction of the visitors,” Will Pattiz said. “For example, try the Flathead National Forest next to Glacier National Park, the Bridger-Teton next to Grand Teton, and the Dixie which borders nearly all of the Utah National Parks.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life"

0,"Hard Hat Mysteriously Travels 3,300 Miles From Maine To Norway",environment," AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A man in Norway discovered a Maine Department of Transportation hard hat more than 3,300 miles (5,310 kilometers) away from its home. Sigbjørn Eide said he was collecting trash earlier this month along Norway’s coast when he came across the white hard hat buried in seaweed. Eide spotted an American flag and a MaineDOT logo on the hard hat, The Boston Globe reported Tuesday. When he got home later that day, Eide said he found out the hat belonged to the Maine Department of Transportation and reached out to the department through social media. Edie told MaineDOT on Feb. 8 that he “was astonished and impressed about the long voyage the small helmet had taken,” the newspaper reported. On Tuesday, MaineDOT posted on Facebook that Eide had found the hat miles away from Maine. “Sigbjørn was on a walk and found a MaineDOT hard hat in a fjord, about 3,300 miles from MaineDOT headquarters,” the department said. “We’re not quite sure how this happened, but we’re glad we have a new pen pal!” A MaineDOT spokesperson said the department won’t ask Eide to return the hat and is planning to send him some items from the state."
1,"Sydney Swimmer Killed By Shark, City's First Deadly Attack In Nearly 60 Years",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY ― Many of Sydney’s iconic beaches, including the famed Bondi Beach, were closed Thursday after an ocean swimmer was killed by a shark, the first fatal attack in the city in almost six decades, authorities said. The man, who has not been identified, was swimming at the city’s Little Bay, a popular spot for families, on Wednesday afternoon when he was attacked by an unknown species of shark. The animal is thought to be up to 16 feet in length and authorities are still searching for it. Local officials closed a stretch of beaches down the city’s eastern coastline, saying the shark could still pose a threat to the public. “The coast is our community’s backyard,” Dylan Parker, the mayor of Sydney’s Randwick area, said Wednesday. “Little Bay is normally such a calm, beautiful place, enjoyed by families. To lose someone to a shark like this is chilling. We are all in shock.” Randwick beaches including Little Bay, Malabar, Maroubra, Coogee, Clovelly and La Perouse will be closed for 24 hours following a fatal shark attack near Little Bay today. Council Lifeguards will patrol beaches over the next 24 hours looking for any further sightings of sharks. pic.twitter.com/KVYcsfWnXJ The swimmer went to the Little Bay area nearly every day, according to local accounts. The New South Wales Ambulance service said he appeared to be wearing a wetsuit while swimming just off the rocks below a fisherman before the shark attacked. The service said human remains had been found in the water, adding that the man died from “catastrophic injuries” despite a quick response from medical services. The last fatal shark attack in Sydney took place in 1963 when a shark bit a 32-year-old woman standing in shallow water about 20 feet offshore. Another person was bitten and injured in 2018 in the Randwick area. Shark attacks are highly covered by the media and cast a major pall over the minds of swimmers and surfers, even though such attacks are a relatively rare occurrence in Australia. The country averages about one fatal shark attack per year, but that number rose in 2020 when there were eight fatal attacks, and 2021, when there were three, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database. “This is their domain and habitat and I think when we all decide to go in the water, we must understand that this is their domain,” Steven Pearce, the head of Surf Life Saving New South Wales told The Sydney Morning Herald. “In saying that, from what happened yesterday, it is shocking, it makes everyone sick just thinking about it and our thoughts and hearts go out so much to the victim’s family and friends.” The New South Wales government said last year it planned to spend $500,000 Australian dollars to help prevent and manage shark attacks in the coming years. Officials said the money would be used for drones that would patrol surf events as well as training for shark-specific first aid. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,"Watchdog Finds Trump Interior Boss Ryan Zinke Violated Ethics Rules, Misused Office",environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Ryan Zinke, Donald Trump’s first scandal-plagued head of the Interior Department, violated ethics rules and misused his office with his ongoing involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, the department’s internal watchdog concluded in a new report. The report from Interior’s Office of Inspector General is yet another scathing rebuke of Zinke’s repeated false claims that internal probes against him were “B.S.” and that he was cleared of all wrongdoing — a drum that he continues to pound as he campaigns for Montana’s new congressional seat. The real estate project, known as 95 Karrow, is financially backed by David Lesar, who was the chairman of oil giant Halliburton at the time. A foundation Zinke started and was president of before resigning to take over Interior ― The Great Northern Veterans Peace Park ― owns a 14-acre lot adjacent to the project site and initially agreed to allow developers to build a parking lot on the foundation’s land. Zinke also had hopes of opening a microbrewery on the site. While in office and after stepping down as the foundation’s president, Zinke stayed in constant contact with project developers and “played an extensive, direct, and substantive role in representing the Foundation during negotiations” on the project, according to the inspector general report. The inspector general concluded Zinke’s actions violated the department ethics agreement that he signed upon being confirmed as secretary. Investigators also concluded that Zinke knowingly provided incorrect and incomplete information when Interior ethics officials questioned him about his involvement, a violation of his duty of candor, and misused his official government position by directing Interior staff to assist him with matters related to the project and the foundation. Investigators, however, did not find that Zinke violated federal conflict-of-interests laws since he did not participate in any Interior matters involving the real estate project. They also did not find that Zinke acted in his official capacity to specifically benefit Halliburton. The inspector general referred its findings to the Justice Department, which last summer declined to prosecute Zinke’s actions, according to the report. “Today’s report shows us yet again that former President Trump’s appointees didn’t view their positions at the highest level of our government as an opportunity to serve our country, but as an opportunity to serve the interests of their personal pocketbooks,” Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. Grijalva is one of three House Democrats who called on the Interior’s internal watchdog to investigate the matter back in 2018. In an email statement, Zinke’s campaign slammed the report as a “political hit job” and claimed investigators “didn’t even bother to talk to Ryan Zinke, staff or anyone else who was supposedly involved in the non-existent ‘negotiations.’” “Only in Biden’s corrupt admin is talking to one’s neighbor about the town’s public meetings and history of the land a sin,” the campaign said. The report was issued by Mark Greenblatt, the Trump-nominated inspector general of the Interior Department. Investigators note in the report that Zinke and his wife, Lola, who took over as the foundation’s president after Zinke’s confirmation, refused multiple requests for an interview. The couple’s unwillingness to cooperate led to the inspector general issuing subpoenas to obtain developers’ phone and email records related to the project. Zinke exchanged more than 60 emails and text messages, participated in up to five phone calls and met in person at least once with 95 Karrow developers while in office, investigators found. Among other things, those communications included discussions and negotiations about specific project design issues and Zinke’s interest in building and running a microbrewery. When media outlets began asking about Zinke’s ongoing involvement with the project, he consulted with project leaders about how to respond. In one particular exchange, Zinke told a developer that an unnamed news organization was “not our friend” and stressed that he’d turned over all decision-making authority to the foundation’s board. Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, said the report “confirmed what we’ve known all along — corruption was rampant in the Trump administration.” “Self-dealing like this was par for the course. Ryan Zinke only got fired because he got caught,” she said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that Attorney General [Merrick] Garland declined to pursue a criminal case against Secretary Zinke. The IG report makes it clear that Zinke broke the law when he ordered his staff to facilitate a meeting and private tour with the developers, one of whom was a top executive at Halliburton.” Zinke faced at least 18 formal investigations during his tenure as head of the Interior Department, and ultimately resigned from his post in January 2019 under a cloud of scandals. He is now running for Montana’s new congressional seat. On the campaign trail, Zinke has railed against resistance among Interior staff and dismissed investigations into his conduct as politically motivated. “All of them ran their course,” he said of the probes during an August interview on the conservative podcast “Ruthless.” “No wrongdoing in the end, and there was no wrongdoing at the beginning.” Not true then, not true now. In 2019, the Office of Inspector General concluded that Zinke violated federal law when he tweeted a photo of himself wearing socks that featured Trump’s face and the words “Make America Great Again.” And in 2018, the agency watchdog determined that Zinke violated government travel policies by bringing his wife on taxpayer-funded trips and by asking staff to explore making her a department volunteer, a move that would have legitimized her travel.

3,EPA Responds After HuffPost Investigates Gulf Chemical Dump: Nothing To See Here,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost After a HuffPost investigation last year brought to light a vast, decades-old chemical dumping ground in the Gulf of Mexico, the Environmental Protection Agency has officially declared that the site is nothing to worry about ― without reviewing any recent scientific data or visiting the site. Last year, HuffPost reported that tens of thousands of 55-gallon drums containing decades-old toxic waste are scattered across a 200-square-mile stretch of ocean floor off the coast of Louisiana, in an area known as Mississippi Canyon. Fossil fuel companies now operate a network of drilling rigs and pipelines within the barrel field — a development that has the potential to disturb drums on the seafloor. The EPA acknowledged at the time it has done little to no oversight since permitting chemical companies to jettison waste there in the 1970s, nor does it know if this offshore dumping has had lingering environmental or human health impacts. In response to HuffPost’s reporting, the EPA launched a review to determine whether the site qualifies for study or cleanup under the federal Superfund program. The assessment is called a pre-CERCLA screening, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, better known as Superfund. The EPA’s review concluded that the site “is not eligible for further investigation” under Superfund because there is no evidence of harm. “No release has been indicated and no threat to human health and the environment has been shown,” Michelle Delgado-Brown, a Superfund site assessment manager at EPA Region 6 in Dallas, wrote in her decision. “Due to the distance from the shoreline (approximately 60 miles offshore) and the depth of the disposal (3,000-feet depth of water), there is no direct contact threat for public health and there are currently no known environmental/public health concerns associated with the site.” The report is dated Dec. 29, 2021, but was not provided to HuffPost until last week. For the screening, Delgado-Brown solely reviewed EPA-issued dumping permits and other historical documents from the 1970s. Every reference document in the report is from 1977 or prior. The agency did not collect or review sediment or water samples for the presence of pollutants, consult with independent scientists or oil and gas companies that operate in the area, or consider how offshore development might be impacting existing barrels, according to information in the report. The result is a document that shines little if any new light on a forgotten, nearly 50-year-old dumping ground — and shuts the door on a more thorough study. “EPA did not perform any kind of comprehensive evaluation,” Charles McCreery, a former water quality expert with the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who spent years investigating and trying to bring attention to the site, said via email when contacted about the findings. “They looked at permits and not the site.” McCreery, who issued a report on the site to Congress in 2019, stressed that he’s aware of no publicly available surveys or sediment analyses of the barrel field. Samantha Joye, an oceanographer and microbiologist at the University of Georgia who has done extensive research in Mississippi Canyon, called the EPA’s screening perfunctory and inadequate. “This is classic ‘out of sight, out of mind,’” she said. The EPA did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the report. To be fair, pre-CERCLA screenings are skeleton reviews meant to guide the EPA in determining next steps for sites brought to the agency’s attention. On its website, the EPA describes them as “relatively low-cost initial” assessments that involve “reviewing existing information and collecting minimal additional information to determine whether a site warrants entry into the Superfund active inventory for further site assessment evaluation.” Only about one-fifth of these screenings lead to further action under Superfund, including in-depth assessments, site visits and remediation. But the EPA’s decision to forgo a more comprehensive assessment at Mississippi Canyon — the kind that could dive into the concerns scientists raised last year about potential impacts to the environment, fisheries and even human health — appears to hinge on the agency’s own dearth of knowledge about the site. The EPA is responsible for monitoring designated offshore dumping grounds. Yet it has not tracked potential short- and long-term environmental impacts at the inactive Mississippi Canyon dump site. As an agency spokesperson told HuffPost last year, “Potential effects have not been assessed.” In some cases, the EPA required chemical companies to study environmental impacts, including whether contaminants persisted in the food chain, as a condition of their offshore dumping permit. In 1973, for example, DuPont reported to the EPA that its barrel dumping in Mississippi Canyon resulted in “no long-term or short-term effects” and that it did not find “any definitive pattern that bioaccumulation has been greater inside the dumping zone than outside.” The EPA keeps this and other impact reports in its archives, but did not review them as part of its eight-month screening. HuffPost has only reviewed the DuPont study, which McCreery obtained as part of a public records request. There’s also nothing in the EPA’s report to indicate that the probe included consulting with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management or the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which regulate offshore oil and gas development and require companies to report any incidents involving barrels at Mississippi Canyon. As of last year, there had been no reported incidents of worker exposure or equipment damage in the barrel field, according to the BOEM. The two Interior Department bureaus routinely notify offshore operators of the hazards associated with the site, where an estimated 205,000 steel barrels of chlorinated hydrocarbons and other chemical wastes were discarded. “Bidders and lessees are advised that the blocks associated with the disposal site and adjacent blocks that are included in the sale area may exhibit hazards from barrel contents (toxic, corrosive, and/or potentially explosive materials),” read a notice for last year’s Gulf lease sale. EPA’s pre-CERCLA decision form includes a 12-question checklist about the site and its known associated risks. In response to the question about whether there is “evidence of an actual release or a potential to release” at the Mississippi Canyon barrel field, Delgado-Brown answered “no.” But saltwater is known to corrode steel over time, and an internal policy that Shell maintains for avoiding seafloor drums while operating in Mississippi Canyon notes that “many of the barrels may have released their contents over time.” “The metallurgy of these drums at some point is going to fail,” said Chris Reddy, an environmental chemist and marine pollution expert at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. Reddy is part of a team that studied a site off the coast of Los Angeles where as many as half a million barrels of the potent and highly toxic insecticide DDT were dumped. Underwater robots captured pictures of barrels that were corroded, punctured and leaking chemicals onto the seafloor. Others looked crunched and weakened, Reddy said. Reddy acknowledged that an in-depth investigation of the Mississippi Canyon site would likely prove costly and labor-intensive, but said he expected more from the EPA’s initial assessment given the potential for the dumped waste to have included more hazardous compounds and byproducts than what companies listed in their 1970s discharge permits. “Our capacity to detect and measure pollutants has dramatically increased in the last 50 years,” he said. “There’s certainly science that could be added to this conversation.” Read the EPA’s report below: Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,"Western Megadrought Worsens To Driest In At Least 1,200 Years",environment," The American West’s megadrought deepened so much last year that it is now the driest in at least 1,200 years and is a worst-case climate change scenario playing out live, a new study finds. A dramatic drying in 2021 — about as dry as 2002 and one of the driest years ever recorded for the region — pushed the 22-year drought passed the previous record-holder for megadroughts in the late 1500s and shows no signs of easing in the near future, according to a study Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study calculated that 42% of this megadrought can be attributed to human-caused  climate change. “Climate change is changing the baseline conditions toward a drier, gradually drier state in the West and that means the worst-case scenario keeps getting worse,” said study lead author Park Williams, a climate hydrologist at UCLA. “This is right in line with what people were thinking of in the 1900s as a worst-case scenario. But today I think we need to be even preparing for conditions in the future that are far worse than this.” Williams studied soil moisture levels in the West — a box that includes California, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, most of Oregon and Idaho, much of New Mexico, western Colorado, northern Mexico, and the southwest corners of Montana and Texas — using modern measurements and tree rings for estimates that go back to the year 800. That’s about as far back as estimates can reliably go with tree rings. A few years ago, Williams studied the current drought and said it qualified as a lengthy and deep “megadrought” and that the only worse one was in the 1500s. He figured the current drought wouldn’t surpass that one because megadroughts tended to peter out after 20 years. And, he said, 2019 was a wet year so it looked like the western drought might be coming to an end. But the region dried up in late 2020 and 2021. All of California was considered in official drought from mid-May until the end of 2021, and at least three-quarters of the state was at the highest two drought levels from June through Christmas, according to the U.S. drought monitor. “For this drought to have just cranked up back to maximum drought intensity in late 2020 through 2021 is a quite emphatic statement by this 2000s drought saying that we’re nowhere close to the end,” Williams said. This drought is now 5% drier than the old record from the 1500s, he said. The drought monitor says 55% of the U.S. West is in drought with 13% experiencing the two highest drought levels. This megadrought really kicked off in 2002 — one of the driest years ever, based on humidity and tree rings, Williams said. “I was wondering if we’d ever see a year like 2002 again in my life and in fact, we saw it 20 years later, within the same drought,” Williams said. The drought levels in 2002 and 2021 were a statistical tie, though still behind 1580 for the worst single year. Climate change from the burning of fossil fuels is bringing hotter temperatures and increasing evaporation in the air, scientists say. Williams used 29 models to create a hypothetical world with no human-caused warming then compared it to what happened in real life — the scientifically accepted way to check if an extreme weather event is due to climate change. He found that 42% of the drought conditions are directly from human-caused warming. Without climate change, he said, the megadrought would have ended early on because 2005 and 2006 would have been wet enough to break it. The study “is an important wake-up call,” said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of environment at the University of Michigan, who wasn’t part of the study. “Climate change is literally baking the water supply and forests of the Southwest, and it could get a whole lot worse if we don’t halt climate change soon.” Williams said there is a direct link between drought and heat and the increased wildfires that have been devastating the West for years. Fires need dry fuel that drought and heat promote. Eventually, this megadrought will end by sheer luck of a few good rainy years, Williams said. But then another one will start. Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t involved in the study, said climate change is likely to make megadrought “a permanent feature of the climate of the Colorado River watershed during the 21st century.” ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/Climate ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears."
11,Twitter Wits Suddenly Get Why Trump Had Such Problems Flushing His Water-Efficient Toilets,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump’s obsession against environmentally sensitive, water-efficient appliances and fixtures — like toilets — is suddenly making a whole lotta sense to Twitter followers. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman’s revelation in her upcoming book “Confidence Man” that Trump’s White House toilets were often clogged with what appeared to be ripped up documents could explain a lot of things — like Trump’s confounding complaints about serious flushing difficulties. Trump has flatly denied Haberman’s report, calling it a “fake story.” But he has complained about flushing issues in the past, leaving many people confused. Americans, he groused in a 2019 meeting to business leaders, are flushing their toilets “10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.” Absolutely. If they’re trying to flush ... documents. And that could reduce water pressure in, say, showers and sinks. “We have a situation where we’re looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of the bathrooms,” Trump declared during his presidency. A light has switched on in the Twitter community. No wonder Trump had a problem with water pressure in the shower with all that flushing going on. REMEMBER THIS?TRUMP; “People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once,” he told reporters from the Roosevelt Room in 2019, claiming the EPA was looking into the alleged problem. NOW WE KNOW WHY - PAPERS!

12,Aquarium Sued After Giant Otter Allegedly Attacks A Child — Again!,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A Texas aquarium is being sued for the second time in less than a year over a giant otter attacking a child. Samantha Jorgensen of Fort Worth filed the suit, published in full by NBC DFW, against the Dallas World Aquarium on behalf of her young daughter this week. Jorgensen alleges that when her family visited the aquarium in September 2019, a giant otter reached over a glass barrier and bit her then-2-year-old daughter’s hand. The plexiglass barrier around the enclosure was about 5 and a half feet tall, but the toddler was sitting on the shoulders of her father, who is 6 feet, 3 inches. To clarify, a giant otter doesn’t just mean a really big otter. Giant otters are their own species, native to South America. They live in freshwater, mostly eat fish and males can grow up to 6 feet long. Here’s a photo of one in the wild: The aquarium did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. The lawsuit, which includes a photo of the bloody injury, states that the otter bite pulled one of the toddler’s fingernails “clean off.” The suit also alleges that the incident caused “permanent scarring.” The aquarium currently has a warning reading, “BE AWARE: GIANT OTTERS ARE ACTIVE ANIMALS AND CAN INJURE YOU,” but the suit alleges this warning was not present during the family’s visit and that they had no idea the otters were able to get over the top of the enclosure. The suit is seeking damages of $250,000 to $1 million. The allegations echo those from a lawsuit filed in October, according to The Dallas Morning News. In that suit, a woman said a giant otter reached over the top of the enclosure and scratched her 18-month-old son. The wound became infected and ultimately caused what the family said was permanent scarring on his arm. It was not clear whether the same otter was involved. Assignment editor, HuffPost"

14,"Koalas Now Endangered In Large Swath Of Australia, Government Says",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY — The Australian government said Friday it would list the country’s iconic koalas as endangered in several states and territories amid plummeting populations linked to climate change and habitat loss. The Australian environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a scientific committee convened to monitor threatened species had recommended koalas for the worrisome listing about two years after the country’s catastrophic “black summer” bushfires, which scorched more than 60 million acres. By some estimates, up to 60,000 koalas were killed or injured in the blazes, prompting environmental groups to nominate the species for the endangered listing. The listing applies to the states of New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. But conservationists say koalas — first listed as vulnerable in 2012 — were under severe threat long before the bushfires. Severe drought and fires exacerbated by climate change, along with a loss in habitat, have contributed to their demise, and studies released in 2020 found koala populations had fallen by at least 50% in the state of Queensland since 2001 and between 33% and 61% in New South Wales during the same period. “The new listing highlights the challenges the species is facing,” Ley said in a statement Friday, pointing to government plans to spend 50 million Australian dollars ($35.7 million USD) to better protect them. “The impact of prolonged drought, followed by the black summer bushfires, and the cumulative impacts of disease, urbanization and habitat loss over the past twenty years have led to the advice,” she said. ⚠️ BREAKING: The Australian Government has uplisted koalas on the east coast from Vulnerable to Endangered.This is a bittersweet outcome, but a critical step towards reversing the decline of koala populations. #KoalasForever(Short thread)👇 pic.twitter.com/Dvy7EN68Xc The designation will provide some additional protection for koalas, namely more assessment requirements for development projects. But it doesn’t mandate any extra rules to protect their habitat, The Sydney Morning Herald noted. Ley said a national plan to help protect them would be sent to states that are home to the endangered creatures, but the plan’s size has drawn criticism as a mere drop in the ocean, particularly as land-clearing efforts expand and the Australian government stands firmly by fossil fuel production. Scientists, environmentalists and lawmakers have been ringing warning bells about koala populations for years. In 2020, a government-backed inquiry said koalas were in danger of going locally extinct in the state of New South Wales — home to Sydney — by 2050 without urgent action to protect their habitat. Environmental groups welcomed the bittersweet news on Friday, saying the upgraded listing means koalas “and their forest homes should be provided with greater protection.” “Koalas have gone from no-listing to vulnerable to endangered within a decade. That is a shockingly fast decline,” Stuart Blanch, a conservation scientist with the Australian branch of the WWF, said in a statement. “Today’s decision is welcome, but it won’t stop koalas from sliding towards extinction unless it’s accompanied by stronger laws and landholder incentives to protect their forest homes.” The International Fund for Animal Welfare said the decision was a double-edged sword. “We should never have allowed things to get to the point where we are at risk of losing a national icon,” Rebecca Keeble, the group’s regional director for Oceania, said in a statement. “It is a dark day for our nation. If we can’t protect an iconic species endemic to Australia, what chance do lesser known but no less important species have?” The koala’s plight is only the latest major environmental issue to arise in Australia. The government has drawn fierce scrutiny over its efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef, which has been hit repeatedly by coral bleaching linked to climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country planned to throw $700 million at that problem last month, but scientists said the money will do little to save the reef when the government is spending billions more to subsidize coal and gas production.

15,Gray Wolves Regain Endangered Species Act Protections,environment," National Reporter, HuffPost Environment Reporter, HuffPost A federal judge on Thursday restored Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves across much of the contiguous United States, concluding that the Trump administration ignored ongoing threats to smaller, more isolated wolf populations when it stripped the species of protections in 2020. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White’s ruling marks a major win for environmental and animal rights groups in their battle with the federal government over whether wolves still need ESA protections. “This is a huge day for wolves across the country,” said Andrea Zaccardi, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity. “Fish and Wildlife Service has tried to remove federal protections several times over the past decade, and every time they skirt the law in doing it.” The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its parent agency, the Department of Interior, both said they are still reviewing the decision. The ruling redesignates gray wolves as a threatened species in 44 states and strips those states of their ability to manage local wolf populations through hunting and trapping. The relisting applies to the Great Lakes states, including Wisconsin: the site of a controversial wolf hunt last year that blew through the state’s 200-wolf harvest quota in three days. “Today’s ruling restoring much-needed federal protections means that wolves will have a chance to fully recover and carry out their important ecological and cultural roles across the country,” Bonnie Rice, a senior representative of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. But it does not affect wolves in the Northern Rockies ― including Montana, Wyoming and Idaho ― which Congress removed from the ESA in 2011. Those states have loosened hunting and trapping restrictions in a controversial effort to reduce wolf populations. Unregulated hunting and government poisoning campaigns waged on behalf of livestock interests nearly wiped gray wolves off the map in the lower 48 by the early 20th century. They have since become one of the Endangered Species Act’s greatest success stories. Since their reintroduction, beginning in Yellowstone National Park and Idaho in 1994, gray wolves have thrived in some areas. In both Idaho and Montana, populations stand about 10 times higher today than the minimum level of 150 that states have to maintain in order to avoid falling back under Endangered Species Act protection. Wolf populations have also grown in the Great Lakes region. Smaller populations of wolves have also continued to disperse into new areas, particularly on the West Coast and in the Central Rockies. Under the Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service pointed to regions where wolves were thriving to argue that wolf populations across the continental United States had recovered. But that logic failed to consider how wolves would fare without ESA protection outside the few areas where they’ve flourished over the last two decades. It also contradicted the agency’s earlier geographic designations of wolf populations and ignored recent scientific research showing the genetic distinctiveness of pockets of wolves outside the main recovery areas. The Fish and Wildlife Service concluded “with little explanation or analysis, that wolves outside of the core populations are not necessary to the recovery of the species,” White wrote in his ruling. The overturning of the Trump administration’s wolf delisting is likely to resurface longstanding tensions over how to manage the large carnivores, especially in the West. Ranching interests and some hunting groups have championed state management as a way to keep wolves from attacking livestock or big game animals. But more liberal and urban constituencies have tended to favor letting wolves flourish. Some 1.8 million people submitted public comments opposing the Trump administration’s decision to delist wolves. A Colorado measure passed in 2020 requires the state’s parks and wildlife division to reintroduce gray wolves. It’s unclear whether the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Joe Biden will fight Thursday’s ruling and continue its years-long effort to remove gray wolves from the ESA. But his administration’s interior secretary, Deb Haaland, appears more sympathetic to relisting wolves in the face of aggressive hunting and trapping campaigns. In a recent op-ed in USA Today, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland wrote that new state laws in Idaho and Montana are jeopardizing decades of work to recover gray wolves in the northern Rockies. “We will reinstate federal protections under the ESA for the northern Rocky Mountains’ gray wolf, if necessary,” she wrote.

0,Prince William Focuses On Conservation During First UAE Trip,environment," DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Britain’s Prince William on Thursday made his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates, where the future monarch highlighted his passionate work around wildlife conservation and climate change. The prince delivered an urgent warning on those issues before an audience at the World’s Fair in Dubai, known as Expo 2020. He spoke at an event to showcase The Earthshot Prize, a global award the prince founded to highlight and scale solutions to repair the planet. “This is the decisive decade,” he said. “If we do nothing, by 2030 we’ll be speeding toward increasingly devastating planetary and humanitarian crises as a result of our changing climate.” “We are still in a race against time,” he said. The one-day visit by the Duke of Cambridge marks a significant milestone in relations between the United Kingdom and the UAE, a Western-allied Gulf Arab nation ruled by hereditary leaders. The prince is expected to meet with Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the son of Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Queen Elizabeth II first visited the UAE as monarch in 1979, while Prince Charles’ last visit was in 2016. Once an informal British protectorate, the UAE has long been a magnet for British nationals. There are more than 100,000 British citizens living in the UAE and more than 6,000 British companies operating in the country, according to the British Business Group in Dubai and Northern Emirates. The Duke of Cambridge’s visit coincides with the U.K.‘s national day at Expo 2020. Prince William visited the U.K. pavilion and toured the $7 billion grounds of the Expo site, as well as the United Arab Emirates’ falcon-shaped pavilion. A sizeable crowd gathered outside the British pavilion, with children waving the Union Jack, women calling out the prince’s name and a group of men impromptu singing “God Save the Queen.” As Prince William toured the UAE, news emerged that his 73-year-old father, Prince Charles, had tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating. It’s the second time the heir to the throne contracts the coronavirus. In his first stop in Dubai, Prince William visited DP World’s massive Jebel Ali Port, where he watched cargo being scanned and inspected by customs to apparently highlight efforts tackling the illegal wildlife trade. His visit comes more than 40 years after his grandmother inaugurated the port during her royal UAE tour. The Dubai-based global ports operator DP World is a principal partner of Prince William’s United for Wildlife, an initiative established by the prince in 2014 to help counter trade in illegal wildlife. The port operator, in partnership with Dubai Expo 2020, is also among the founding funding partners to the prince’s Earthshot Prize. Last year’s finalists talked about their innovative solutions to an audience at Expo’s DP World pavilion following remarks by Prince William, who referred to the Dubai government-owned port company as among the “incredible financers” of The Eartshot Prize. Launched by Prince William and The Royal Foundation in late 2020, The Earthshot Prize held its first-ever award ceremony last year, offering five, 1 million-pound ($1.36 million) prizes to innovators and entrepreneurs seeking solutions to the world’s greatest environmental problems. The award is being funded for 10 years, totaling 50 prizes. This year’s award ceremony will be held in the United States. The duke, like his father Prince Charles, has long used his platform to advocate for greater environmental awareness, warning that the Earth is at a tipping point and facing irreparable damage unless action is taken to repair the planet. “Our future is not yet set,” the prince said at Expo. “We still have the ability to repair out planet and create a better world.” Prince William, who is traveling without his wife, Catherine, began his tour in the UAE with a visit to Abu Dhabi’s Jubail Mangrove Park. There, he met with children planting mangroves, and he planted one himself. He was accompanied by Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a son of Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince. Katy Holmes, general manager of the British Business Group, said Britons are really excited about the prince’s visit because it sends a positive message about strengthening a bilateral relationship so well established by Queen Elizabeth II, who marked 70 years on the throne Sunday. “He’s very well regarded as a royal and he is the future of the U.K. monarchy, so I think there’s interest from that perspective. But it’s also a celebration of Expo,” said Holmes, who is among those invited to attend an evening performance at Expo that will be attended by Prince William. The territories of the UAE have attracted British attention since the early 18th Century, when the area was seen as part of a strategic Persian Gulf trade route with links to India and other British colonies. The territories, ruled by various tribal sheikhs, later signed an agreement restricting their foreign relations to British discretion until the founding of the United Arab Emirates in 1971. Oil wealth helped rapidly transform Abu Dhabi’s and Dubai’s humid coastlines into a head-turning metropolis of skyscrapers and endless five-star hotels. South Asian migrant workers have borne the brunt of building and paving the UAE’s cities from the desert up. British nationals, however, have largely enjoyed the higher pay, warmer winters, lower tax rates and luxury living conditions afforded to Western expatriates in the Gulf. British nationals fill critical teaching jobs in the country, but also hold a range of positions working as hair stylists, fitness trainers, real estate brokers, bartenders, hotel managers and events planners, to name a few. British accents dominate English-language radio broadcasts and British pub culture is popular in Dubai."
1,Tire Finally Removed From Crocodile's Neck After 6 Years,environment," PALU, Indonesia (AP) — A wild crocodile with a used motorcycle tire stuck around its neck for six years has finally been freed by an Indonesian bird catcher in a tireless effort that wildlife conservation officials hailed as a milestone Wednesday. The 4.5-meter (14.8-foot) saltwater female crocodile has become an icon to the people in Palu, the capital city of Central Sulawesi. The beast was seen on the city’s river with the tire around its neck becoming increasingly tighter, running the risk of choking her. Conservation officials were racing to rescue the crocodile since residents spotted the reptile in 2016, generating sympathy among residents and worldwide. In 2020, Australian crocodile wrangler Matthew Wright and American wildlife biologist Forrest Galante tried and failed to free the reptile. In early January, 35-year-old bird catcher and trader Tili, who recently moved to the city, heard about the famous crocodile from his neighbors and determined to rescue the reptile after he saw her frequently sunbathing at a nearby estuary. “I have experiences and skills in catching animals, not only birds, but farm animals that are released from the cage,” Tili, who goes by a single name, told The Associated Press. “I believe I can rescue the crocodile with my skills.” He stringed ropes of various sizes into a trap tied to a tree near the river, and laid chickens, ducks and birds as bait. After three weeks of waiting and several failed attempts, the crocodile finally fell into the trap Monday night. With the help of two of his friends, Tili pulled the trapped crocodile ashore and sawed through the tire, which was 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) in diameter. A video that circulated widely on the internet showed a crowd cheering nearby as Tili and his friends broke the crocodile free. Other residents then contacted firefighters and a wildlife conservation agency to help them release the animal back into the wild. “For all of the efforts Tili has done for protected wildlife and being the kind of animal lover he is, that’s a great milestone,” said Haruna Hamma who heads Central Sulawesi province’s conservation agency. He said it was unclear how a used motorcycle tire got stuck around the crocodile neck. Conservationists have said that it was likely deliberately placed by people in a failed attempt to trap it as a pet or skin it for sale, but crocodiles and other swimming reptiles often travel into garbage-studded waters with nothing to stop a tire from encircling them, Hamma said. Government data recorded 279 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands, between 2007 and 2014. Of these, as many as 268 cases of attacks were carried out by saltwater crocodiles, of which 135 were fatal. Despite the attacks, the saltwater crocodile is protected under Indonesian law."
2,Lawmakers Urge Pentagon To Update Climate Plans In Upcoming Strategy To Keep U.S. ‘Safe’,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost A coalition of lawmakers urged the Pentagon this week to better address climate change in its upcoming National Defense Strategy, saying a concrete plan to respond to a warming world could save millions of lives and billions of dollars. The letter, addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was spearheaded by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Alongside 16 other members of Congress, the group said the Pentagon’s current national security budget — a mammoth $777 billion — fails “to protect Americans from the worsening climate crisis” and does not address the agency’s role “as the world’s largest consumer of fossil fuels and emitter of greenhouse gases.” “Climate change is a clear and present threat to both national security and Americans,” the lawmakers wrote on Monday. “A strategy that integrates climate change considerations at all levels, and shifts our national security budget to effectively address these threats is a critical step to keeping the United States and its citizens safe.” The lawmakers went on to urge the Pentagon to ensure the National Defense Strategy prioritizes federal investment to tackle climate risks, and “not accept climate change and rising temperatures as an inevitable.” “By treating the climate crisis as the existential and national security threat that it is through the National Defense Strategy, DoD can maintain national security and military readiness, avoid billions of dollars in damages and save millions of lives,” they wrote. Lee has long urged the Defense Department to be more transparent about its efforts to combat climate change. In November, the lawmaker introduced a resolution calling on the agency to release details about its annual greenhouse gas emissions after the Pentagon failed to do so by a July 1 deadline mandated in a defense spending bill. Warren has also called on the agency to increase its resilience against climate change, and has been a major critic of the fossil fuel industry. The Pentagon’s own climate risk assessment, released last October, was just one of several government reports to warn the military will need to spend a significant portion of its annual budget to address climate-related threats in the near future. Bases are already under threat from flooding, wildfires and rising seas, as well as increased numbers of damaging storms. The lawmakers noted Monday that the Defense Department requested nearly $9 billion in additional funding in 2019 to repair damage to military bases after several hurricanes, stressing such threats will only grow if greenhouse gas emissions are not reined in. A separate report by the nation’s intelligence agencies said climate-related threats will exacerbate global tensions and lead to an uptick in conflict between nations’ borders.

3,Democrats Block Trump EPA Chief's Bid For Top Virginia Environmental Post,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers in Virginia rejected Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nomination of Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump’s controversial second head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former coal lobbyist, to serve as the state’s top environmental official. The Senate voted 21-19 along party lines Tuesday in support of an amendment that cut Wheeler’s name from a resolution approving Youngkin’s Cabinet appointments. “Mr. Wheeler’s track record on the environment and energy indicates he will unravel the progress we have achieved to address climate change, mitigate the effects of sea level rise, and protect the natural beauty of our Commonwealth,” Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke and Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw said in a joint statement following the vote. “After hearing grave concerns from our communities, stakeholders, and organizations ― as well as Mr. Wheeler’s former colleagues at the EPA ― we cannot in good conscience confirm such an alarming choice.” The fight over Wheeler’s nomination may not be over. After a final vote in the Senate on Wednesday, the resolution will be taken up by the House, where Republicans hold a majority. As The Washington Post reported, House Republicans could add his name back to the measure or pursue other avenues for reviving the nomination. Tuesday’s vote caps an unusually contentious confirmation process. The last time the Virginia General Assembly blocked a nomination was in 2006, when Republicans rejected Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine’s nomination of Daniel LeBlanc to serve as secretary of the commonwealth. In recent weeks, scores of current and former EPA employees urged Virginia lawmakers to vote against Wheeler, citing his record of gutting environmental rules while at the helm of the EPA. Democrats in the state Senate signaled last month that they were united in their opposition and had the votes to sink Wheeler’s nomination. But one member of the party, Sen. Joseph D. Morrissey, revived what already seemed like a doomed nomination, telling The Washington Post after Wheeler’s appearance before a Senate committee that he was “very much open” to confirming Youngkin’s Cabinet pick. On Tuesday, however, Morrissey joined fellow Democrats in defeating the nomination. Youngkin tapped Wheeler to serve as his secretary of natural resources in January and has stood behind him in the face of mounting public pressure, maintaining he was the most qualified person for the post. “The governor is disappointed in today’s vote because he was looking forward to Mr. Wheeler accomplishing great things on behalf of Virginians,” Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said in an email statement Tuesday. “Pursuant to the Constitution, he will continue to serve as Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources until the General Assembly adjourns. In the meantime, we hope the Senate will reconsider.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

10,More And More Orcas Have Started Using Fishing Lines As Free Buffets,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Give an orca some fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Try to keep your fish from an orca, and he’ll figure out how to eat them — and teach all his friends to do the same. Orcas, also known as killer whales, have long been known to dine on fish that people have caught in lines or nets. And a new paper examining the phenomenon paints a picture of how the socially complex animals respond to their environment being altered by human activity. The paper, published in the journal Biology Letters, analyzed years of data involving two different killer whale populations near the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean. Since the 1990s, the region has been a hotspot for commercial fishing of the Patagonian toothfish — a fish often marketed under the name “Chilean sea bass.” The toothfish are caught on longlines along the bottom of the ocean floor, meaning that one big fishing line is baited with many hooks and each hook nabs an individual fish. As the lines get drawn up from the deep water, they essentially become “the open ocean equivalent of the conveyor belt in a sushi bar,” as Luke Rendell, a Scottish biology lecturer uninvolved with the study, put it in a piece for The Conversation. The researchers looked at data from 2003 to 2018 and noted that incidents of orcas eating the fish off the hooks, referred to as “depredation,” gradually increased over time. This seemed to be due to individual orcas picking up the behavior from one another. One of the orca populations the scientists studied was first reported feeding off of fishery catches in 1996. By 2014, all 80 to 100 orcas in the group had started doing it. In addition to the ease of snatching fish off of a fishing line, another reason contributing to the behavior catching on could be overfishing. In the 2000s, as the population declined, it became more difficult for orcas to catch toothfish themselves, but they then encountered “increased and predictable” opportunities to pluck their prey off of fishing lines. Overall, the researchers were struck by how thoroughly commercial fishing had changed the orcas’ behavior over time. “This study is illustrative of how human activities, by altering the availability of resources in ecosystems, may lead to new behaviours (sic) spreading across individuals of species capable of innovating in response to changes in their environment,” they wrote.

11,Candace Cameron Bure Says She And Bob Saget Got Into 'Little Tiff' Before His Death,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Candace Cameron Bure lovingly recalled her final conversation and last words with Bob Saget before the comedian died in January. During an appearance on “Today” this week, Bure told Hoda Kotb that she and Saget, who played her father on “Full House,” got into a “little tiff” just two weeks before Saget died, but luckily were able to patch things up right away. “We were going to have dinner. And we got into a little tiff. And his flight was delayed ― we ended up not having dinner,” Bure said. “But, in Bob fashion, the next day he wrote me what would be pages-long of a text,” she said, adding that the comedian “was apologizing, saying he was cranky and he was just so sorry.” Saget said that his “cranky” behavior reminded him of his late mom, Dolly, in his texts to Bure. “He said, ‘Oh now I feel even worse. I was so wrong. You’re, like, my favorite person on the earth. And I acted like Dolly. I was getting ready to take a late flight and I was annoyed,’” she said, explaining that “Bob went on and on and on in the text.” “And he said at the end, ‘I love you more for the trouble you’re giving me, if that’s even possible,’” Bure said. “And I wrote back, ‘I love you ― I could never be mad at you. Roll my eyes at you? Yes. But never mad.’” “‘And I love that [you being] Dolly. That made me laugh out loud. I loved your mom,’” she added. Bob texted back, “I love you. My mom loved you too.” Bure told Kotb that the last texts from Saget are precious to her. “I’m so scared that I’m gonna pull up his text and then accidentally delete it one day,” Bure said as her voice started to break. “It scares me so much. Because I don’t ever want to lose this.” Saget, 65, was found dead in Orlando, Florida, after performing a stand-up show in Jacksonville while on a nationwide comedy tour. A cause of death was not immediately known, but foul play and drug use were not suspected. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,"Stopping Pandemics Costs 95% Less Than Dealing With Them, Study Finds",environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost New research reinforces the old adage that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” when it comes to preventing future pandemics. With the world now entering its third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a team of 20 experts have released a “blueprint” for stopping animal-borne pathogens from spilling over into humans. The study, led by Harvard University researchers and published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, finds that implementing just three pandemic prevention strategies — halting deforestation, improving disease monitoring and surveillance, and better managing the wildlife trade — would cost a fraction of the annual economic and human losses that result from emerging infectious diseases. Less than 5%, to be exact ― and that’s a conservative estimate. Aaron Bernstein, the study’s lead author and director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, said during a call with reporters this week that given the world’s ongoing experience with COVID-19, it would be foolish not to invest in an alternative path that costs 5 cents on the dollar. “Our salvation comes cheap,” he said. Pathogens that spread from animals to humans are known as zoonotic diseases, and scientists warn that the threat of transmission is increasing as humans destroy ecosystems and exploit wildlife. The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have started when the novel coronavirus leapt from bats to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has so far killed more than 5.7 million people worldwide, including nearly 900,000 in the United States, and could cost the global economy $12.5 trillion through 2024. “Even if we were to reduce the risk of a bad pandemic by 1%, these measures would be cost-effective.” For its study, the Harvard-led team reviewed mortality data for all emerging zoonotic diseases that killed at least 10 people dating back to the 1918 Spanish flu. It concludes that with today’s population, 3.3 million people are expected to die each year from virus outbreaks. This loss of life translates to between $350 billion to $21 trillion annually, depending on different monetary estimates for the value of an individual human life. On top of that, disease outbreaks cause an estimated $212 billion annually in direct economic losses, according to the study. By comparison, advancing techniques to avert future outbreaks, which the report identifies as “primary pandemic prevention,” would cost an estimated $20 billion annually. And it wouldn’t take much for this kind of global investment to pay off. “Even if we were to reduce the risk of a bad pandemic by 1%, these measures would be cost-effective,” Bernstein said. “These measures have to be very modestly effective to justify their value.” The study makes a clear case for shifting resources from pandemic preparedness and response to early prevention. The authors argue that the world is going about fighting emerging zoonotic diseases all wrong, focusing on vaccines, testing and other post-outbreak actions while largely ignoring ways to stamp out the next pandemic before it starts. “Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail, ‘detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats,’” the report states. “In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree.” Stuart Pimm, a study author and ecology professor at Duke University, said it is obvious that the tools for battling COVID-19 are far from perfect. “Only 60% of Americans are vaccinated. We’re not getting vaccines anywhere near the numbers we need to to people in poor countries,” he said. “We need to start thinking about preventions. Those preventions are broadly things that we know how to do, and broadly things that we could implement quite quickly.” Deforestation and other land-use changes are the single biggest driver of zoonotic disease outbreaks that have occurred since 1940, a 2015 study found. At the United Nations’ climate conference last year in Scotland, more than 100 nations, including Brazil, the U.S., Canada and Russia, signed an initiative to halt deforestation by the end of the decade. But a similar pact in 2014 did little to slow the razing of the world’s forests. The new study notes that refocusing global pandemic efforts toward prevention would come with significant additional benefits, including preventing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, protecting water supplies and safeguarding biodiversity. Bernstein argues that the world’s current approach for dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases would be akin to confronting climate change solely through adaptation, without any mitigation. “If we were living on a planet with a stable climate and an intact biosphere, we might be able to afford waiting until disaster happens and trying to contain it,” he said. “But the reality is we don’t, and to operate on that premise is one of the greatest pieces of folly in modern times. To ignore the reality that the driver of disease emergence has to do with tumult in the living world and how we’re doing business with it, is really shocking in this day and age. And we simply cannot afford to take a post-spillover approach alone.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost"

The Associated Press noted most of the power outages so far were linked to icy or downed power lines in Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas and Ohio, but the storm’s path threatened homes into the South and Northeast. The National Weather Service warned the Northeast that the storm was moving through the region, saying some areas in Pennsylvania and southern New England could see up to a foot of snow and others could get up to half an inch of ice. Parts of the Midwest, including the Chicago area, have already seen nearly a foot of snow, and the Arkansas Department of Transportation warned that any precipitation was expected to freeze overnight “and heighten the potential for black ice tomorrow.” The major winter storm over the Central U.S. is moving into the Northeast. Please see our latest Key Messages for more details. pic.twitter.com/xKQOXKm5QB “The freezing rain over the Mid-South will progress northeastward into the Northeast Thursday evening, where significant ice accumulation is possible from central Pennsylvania eastward into the Catskills in New York,” the National Weather Service said Thursday. “The snow/rain/freezing rain could make for difficult travel conditions along with some power outages and tree damage.” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said officials were monitoring ice accumulations across the state on Thursday evening and were urging New Yorkers to take caution if going outside. “Pay close attention to the forecast, be careful on the roads, and remember — it’s better to get there late than not at all,” she said on Twitter. Temperatures were expected to remain below freezing through the weekend, leaving any accumulated ice on roadways and power lines, where it will remain a hazard. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Thursday the storm was “one of the most significant icing events that we’ve had in the state of Texas in at least several decades,” although officials said the event wasn’t as severe as last year’s damaging deep freeze, which left many residents without power amid frigid temperatures for more than two weeks. The state’s energy grid appeared to be meeting demand into Thursday, a major test for Abbott and the state’s emergency response effort, The Dallas Morning News reported. More than 6,000 scheduled flights were canceled on Thursday and Friday, and 110 million people, almost a third of the country, were under winter weather warnings or advisories. Strong winds across parts of the South prompted weather officials to warn of severe thunderstorms and the potential for tornadoes. Alabama reported a tornado near Sawyerville on Thursday, which left at least one woman dead and several others injured. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Explosion Risk 'Greatly Diminished' At North Carolina Fertilizer Plant,environment," Reporter, HuffPost The risk of an explosion at a North Carolina fertilizer plant that caught fire earlier this week has “greatly diminished,” but the community isn’t out of the woods yet, officials said Thursday. Flames have consumed enough of the combustible substances at the plant in Winston-Salem for firefighters to go in and begin “cooling operations,” said the city’s fire chief, William “Trey” Mayo, on Thursday after consulting with an expert on the explosives. When the Winston Weaver Company fertilizer plant caught fire on Monday evening, it held about 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer and 600 tons of ammonium nitrate — which can create toxic nitrogen oxide and ammonia when exposed to high temperatures, and may explode. That’s enough ammonium nitrate to cause “one of the worst explosions in U.S. history,” Mayo said Wednesday. Up until now, it’s been too dangerous for firefighters to approach the scene. HELMET CAM VIDEO - Weaver Fertilizer site #WeaverFire #WSFire .107 pic.twitter.com/HnVkmGlGra The fire department now has about 500 gallons of water per minute flowing onto piles of fertilizer and ammonium nitrate at the facility. However, Mayo added, “We don’t know what may happen when we start, you know, getting in and poking around in the plant and moving things around with heavy equipment.” “At this point, the greatest risk is from a rapid fire condition due to moving stuff around and opening things that have the heat and the fuel, but they don’t have the air,” he explained. People are still advised to stay far away from the area, he added. Overnight rain helped reduce the explosion risk as well, but it also increased contaminated runoff water and pushed smoke closer to the ground, posing a greater health hazard. The Environmental Protection Agency is on site, monitoring those exposure risks to the community. “They’re measuring particulate matter, they’re measuring compounds of sulfur, they’re measuring ammonia, they’re measuring nitrogen dioxide,” Mayo said. Questions about fire safety at the facility have swirled in the days since the fire ignited. The Winston-Salem plant was built in 1939, the media has noted, allowing it to bypass current ordinances requiring sprinklers to be in place. “It’s difficult to speculate, but what we do know is, historically ... there’s never been a multi-death fire in America in a building that was properly equipped with fire sprinklers,” Mayo said Thursday when asked about the role sprinklers could have played. City council member D.D. Adams promised to find help for the 6,500 people who’ve incurred the costs of evacuating the area. “They don’t feel safe. They’re anxious. They’re nervous,” she said at Thursday’s press conference. “They don’t know when some of them are coming back home. And the hotel bills are killing them because most of everyone lives from paycheck to paycheck.” Mayo spoke through tears as he recalled the high-stakes decisions his department has had to make in response to the fire and the moment the ammonium nitrate expert he brought in told him they’d done exactly what was needed. “I can go to bed and sleep for the rest of my life being confident in the decisions we made this week,” Mayo said.

15,Wandering Hen Caught Sneaking Around Pentagon Security Area,environment," WASHINGTON (AP) — A wandering chicken was caught sneaking around a security area at the Pentagon, a local animal welfare organization said. The loose hen was found early Monday morning near the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, Virginia, wrote on social media. “Apparently, the answer to ‘why did the chicken cross the road’ is to get to the Pentagon,” the group posted. The chicken was taken into custody by one of the league’s employees. Chelsea Jones, a spokesperson for the organization, said in an email that she couldn’t reveal the precise location where the bird was spotted. “We are not allowed to disclose exactly where she was found,” Jones said. “We can only say it was at a security checkpoint.” It’s also unclear where the chicken came from or how she got to the Pentagon. The hen — which has brown feathers and a red comb and wattles — is a Rhode Island Red. Jones described the bird as “sweet” and “nervous” but said she has allowed some people to pet her. She’s now known as Henny Penny, one of the names given to the chicken that thinks “the sky is falling” in a folk tale. This one has gained notoriety of her own: Jimmy Fallon performed a song about her on “The Tonight Show.” “Are you a normal clucker or an undercover spy?” Fallon sang on his Tuesday episode. Jones said Henny Penny is being adopted by a staff member who has a small farm in western Virginia."

0,"As Winter Storm Moves Across US, Ice Becomes Bigger Concern",environment," CHICAGO (AP) — A major winter storm with millions of Americans in its path spread rain, freezing rain and heavy snow further across the country on Thursday, knocking out power to more than 100,000 homes and businesses and disrupting flights at the busy Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. A long stretch of states from New Mexico to Maine remained under winter storm warnings and watches and the path of the storm stretched further from the central U.S. into more of the South and Northeast. Heavy snow was expected from the southern Rockies to northern New England, while forecasters said heavy ice buildup was likely from Texas to Pennsylvania. “We have a lot of real estate covered by winter weather impacts this morning,” Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, said early Thursday. “We do have an expansive area of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain occurring.” Parts of Ohio, New York and northern New England were expected to see heavy snowfall as the storm moves to the east with 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) of snow possible in some places through Friday, Orrison said. Along the warmer side of the storm, strong thunderstorms capable of damaging wind gusts and tornadoes were possible Thursday in parts of Mississippi and Alabama, the Storm Prediction Center said. More than 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow was reported in the southern Rockies, while more than a foot of snow fell in areas of Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. Sleet and freezing rain were occurring early Thursday in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power, mostly in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas, according to the website poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports. “Unfortunately we are looking at enough ice accumulations that we will be looking at significant travel impacts,” Orrison said. Ice began accumulating Thursday in parts of West Tennessee including Memphis, Tennessee, causing power outages and dangerous road conditions during the morning commute. Trees sagged under the weight of ice, resulting in fallen tree limbs and branches. Parked cars had a layer of ice on them and authorities in several communities around Memphis warned of some cars sliding off slick roadways. Texas had about 70,000 power outages Thursday morning, far from the more than 4 million outages that paralyzed the state during the February 2021 freeze in one of the worst blackouts in U.S. history. The return of subfreezing weather and ice in Texas was unsettling to many residents after last year’s catastrophic outages. In San Antonio, where roughly 30,000 homes were without power Thursday morning, officials stressed the outages were local disruptions — such as downed power lines — and not grid failures. South Bend, Indiana, reported a record snowfall for the date on Wednesday with 11.2 inches (28.5 centimeters), eclipsing the previous record of 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) set on the date in 1908, said Hannah Carpenter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s office in Syracuse, Indiana. Once the storm pushes through, she said temperatures will see a big drop, with Friday’s highs mostly in the upper teens followed by lows in the single digits in northern Indiana, along with bone-chilling wind chills. “It’s definitely not going to be melting real quick here,” Carpenter said Thursday morning. The frigid temperatures settled into areas after the snowy weather, with Kansas residents awakening to dangerous wind chills of around 15 below zero (26 degrees Celsius below zero). In New Mexico, schools and nonessential government services were closed in some areas Thursday because of the icy roads. The disruptive storm began Tuesday and moved across the central U.S. on Wednesday’s Groundhog Day, the same day the famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter. The storm came on the heels of a nor’easter last weekend that brought blizzard conditions to many parts of the East Coast. Airlines canceled nearly 7,000 flights in the U.S. scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, the flight-tracking service FlightAware.com showed. More than 1,000 flights were canceled Thursday alone at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and more than 300 were canceled at nearby Dallas Love Field. ___ Bleed reported from Little Rock, Arkansas.

1,Miami Agrees To Do Something About Its Peacock Problem,environment," MIAMI (AP) — Peacocks could be on the outs in some South Florida neighborhoods after the Miami-Dade commission agreed to loosen a law protecting the birds. While the 20-year-old law still protects peacocks from harm, commissioners agreed Tuesday to allow cities to opt out if they present appropriate plans to humanely remove the divisive birds from areas where they’re not wanted, the Miami Herald reported. “Mating season is when we get the most complaints. They get very aggressive,” said sponsor Raquel Regalado, whose district includes neighborhoods in Coral Gables and Miami where peacocks roam freely. “They lay their eggs, they build their nests, they peck the cars.” Neighbors often clash over the peacocks. Some love the colorful birds while others complain of droppings, noise and the damage they cause by roosting on cars or houses. “In my district, we learn to live with these peacocks,” said Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins, representing Palmetto Bay, which has designated itself a bird sanctuary. “They almost become a part of the community. I know our residents lose it when anyone harms any of these peacocks.” Non-native species have a tendency to wear out their welcome in sunny Florida, where the state wildlife commission has encouraged the killing of iguanas and Burmese pythons. The county’s 2001 peafowl ordinance was adopted following a petition drive to save a flock of peacocks in south Miami-Dade, forbidding their killing or capture. An exemption allowed homeowners to remove them, and one neighborhood did so in 2020 after an amendment allowed for removal of excess peacocks. State laws on non-native species prevent them from being released back into the wild, however, and many sanctuaries won’t take them. “We searched statewide for a sanctuary or zoo that would accept them,” said Assistant Director Kathy Labrada. “The alternative is humane euthanasia.” Regalado initially tried to repeal the ordinance entirely, but other commissioners resisted to avoid killing the birds, the Herald reported. “Are we talking about sentencing peacocks to death now?” asked Commissioner Oliver Gilbert. Commissioners finally agreed 5-4 to water down the law, allowing cities to opt out after submitting peafowl “mitigation” plans. Regalado said the challenge for municipal leaders will be finding places to relocate the peacocks, since euthanizing them likely won’t win support. “This really is not about killing,” she said. “This is about moving.”"
2,Prognostication Time: Punxsutawney Phil Makes His Groundhog Day Prediction,environment," PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) — There will be six more weeks of winter, Punxsutawney Phil predicted as he emerged from his burrow on Wednesday to perform his Groundhog Day duties. Thousands of people gathered at Gobbler’s Knob as members of Punxsutawney Phil’s “inner circle” summoned him from his tree stump at dawn to learn if he had seen his shadow. After Phil’s prediction was announced, the crowd repeatedly chanted “six more weeks!” According to folklore, spring would come early if he didn’t see it. The event took place virtually last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, depriving the community, which is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, of a boost from tourists. It was streamed live and seen by more than 15,000 viewers worldwide at one point. About 150 cardboard cutouts of fans were there to “watch.” The annual event has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent. According to records dating back to 1887, Phil has predicted winter more than 100 times. Ten years were lost because no records were kept, organizers said. The 2020 forecast called for an early spring."
3,Oregon Lawmakers Take Aim At Explosion Of Illegal Pot Farms,environment," SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Seven years after Oregon voters legalized the regulated production and use of recreational marijuana, the state Legislature is set to consider a raft of measures to crack down on an explosion of illegal pot farms. Underscoring the industrial-size scale of the illegal marijuana farms, the Rogue Area Drug Enforcement, or RADE, announced this week it seized 52 tons of illegal marijuana last year. That was in southern Oregon alone. The amount of pot seized was greater than previous years, Grants Pass Police Department Detective Sgt. Doni Hamilton, a member of the RADE team, said in an email. Many of the growers are claiming to be legal hemp farmers but are instead cultivating plants with illegal amounts of THC, the component that creates the “high,” according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. “A lot of people have been using hemp as a cover,” OLCC spokesperson Mark Pettinger said in an interview last year. One of the bills put forward for Oregon’s five-week legislative session that began Tuesday aims to financially punish those who are operating under the guise of growing hemp. Industrial hemp was legalized nationally by Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill. Under a bill sponsored by Sen. Bill Hansell, R-Athena, and Rep. Lily Morgan, R-Grants Pass, a building or other premises used for unlawful growing or handling of hemp would be subjected to lien and could be sold to pay all fines and costs. Another bill authorizes the Oregon Department of Agriculture to refuse to issue industrial hemp grower licenses, based on supply and demand for the product. Meanwhile, a bill sponsored by Sen. Tim Knopp, leader of the minority Republicans in the Senate, would have the Oregon State Police establish a unit to assist overwhelmed county sheriffs’ offices in uprooting the illegal pot farms. The state police would ensure that each county sheriff’s office receives at least $500,000 annually for the offensive on illegal pot growers, with more resources going to sheriffs who demonstrate a greater need. The Oregon Department of Revenue would transfer funds to the state police for these purposes. During this year’s short legislative session, lawmakers have numerous bills to push through committees and send to both the House and Senate for approval. Many will die along the way in the limited time period, especially those that haven’t been fine-tuned yet, leaders of the majority Democratic caucus said Tuesday. But Senate President Peter Courtney has said he’s very concerned about the surge in illegal marijuana farms in southern Oregon, and even suggested the Oregon National Guard be sent in to help, and so might favor legislation aimed at tackling the problem.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

7,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Virginia Senate Panel Rejects Trump EPA Chief For Top Virginia Environmental Post,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Democratic state senators in Virginia took a first step Tuesday toward blocking Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump’s controversial second head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former coal lobbyist, from becoming the state’s top environmental official. A Senate committee that considers gubernatorial nominees voted 9-6 along party lines to remove Wheeler’s name from a resolution approving Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) Cabinet appointments. But, as The Virginian-Pilot reported, it may not be the end of the line for Wheeler’s nomination. His name could ultimately be added back to the resolution on the Senate floor. All it would take is a single Democrat in the narrowly divided state Senate voting with Republicans. Tuesday’s vote adds to what has proved to be a contentious confirmation process, in which scores of current and former EPA employees urged Virginia lawmakers to vote against Wheeler, citing his record of gutting environmental rules while at the helm of the federal agency. Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke called Wheeler’s nomination “dangerous for Virginia’s future.” “Governor Youngkin has said time and time again he would like to bridge the partisan divide and work together for Virginia’s next generation,” Locke said in a statement following the vote. “However, his choice of Trump alum Andrew Wheeler for the position of Secretary of Natural Resources proves his unwillingness to bring properly qualified officials into our government.” Youngkin tapped Wheeler to serve as his secretary of natural resources in January and, in the face of mounting public pressure, maintained he was “the most qualified person for this job.” Democrats, who hold a 21-19 majority in the state Senate, signaled last week that they were united in their opposition and had the votes to sink Wheeler’s nomination. But one member of the party, Sen. Joseph D. Morrissey, revived what seemed like a doomed nomination, telling The Washington Post after Wheeler’s appearance before a Senate committee last week that he was “very much open” to confirming Youngkin’s Cabinet pick. At that hearing, Wheeler defended his legacy and said he’d become a lightning rod because the press did not cover “positive things” during his tenure. He also blamed Congress for his own inaction on climate change, arguing he was “dealt a very limited hand” to confront the global threat since Congress hasn’t passed more stringent laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions. After listening to Wheeler’s testimony, Morrissey told the former EPA chief that he was “very articulate and persuasive.” Environmental groups accused Wheeler of trying to rewrite history. In Virginia, governors’ Cabinet nominees typically sail through confirmation. But Wheeler, who played an outsize role in the Trump administration’s industry-friendly deregulatory push, emerged as a uniquely controversial choice. More than 150 former EPA employees; dozens of environmental groups and AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, all sent letters calling for Virginia senators to oppose Youngkin’s choice. In response to mounting criticism, more than 130 of Wheeler’s former colleagues at EPA and elsewhere sent their own letter defending his record and dismissing previous letters as “highly biased and unsupported.” In a statement following Tuesday’s vote, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said the governor “is disappointed that the committee put partisan politics over the selection of an experienced public servant who would prioritize cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay and James River.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,GOP Senate Hopeful: My Landscaping Means ‘I Do More For Climate Change Than Anyone’,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Chuck Morse, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in New Hampshire, said owning a plant nursery and landscaping company means he has done “more for climate change than anyone,” despite a long record as a state lawmaker of opposing carbon-cutting policies. In a local television interview Sunday, Morse, the president of the New Hampshire state Senate, signaled his opposition to federal efforts to cut planet-heating pollution. He cast those who advocate for emissions cuts from the United States — which has cumulatively added more carbon to the atmosphere than any other country — as elitist hypocrites. “The part that bothers me most is these people that get on airplanes and fly on their little junkets and drink their wine and basically start to discuss how they’re going to change the world, and they do it only in the United States,” he told WMUR’s “CloseUp” program. By contrast, “I do more for climate change than anyone else out there,” said Morse, 61. “I mean, I own a nursery and garden center. I’ve been a landscaper,” he said. “I planted more trees than any of the candidates that are running together, you know, at any point in time.” Yet Morse, who hopes to take on Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in November, has routinely voted against measures to cut emissions during the nearly quarter-century he’s spent as a Granite State legislator. In 2020, he voted twice against net-metering policies to help provide financial incentives to utility ratepayers who produce their own clean electricity. In 2019, he opposed expanding protections for wetlands, came out against establishing a greenhouse gas rebate program, and voted down a bill to increase the state’s solar-energy targets. In 2011, he voted to withdraw New Hampshire from the regional cap-and-trade market, in which more than a dozen East Coast states set a limit on carbon emissions and allow companies to trade permits to pollute. “Senator Morse has a long voting record that contradicts his climate claims,” Catherine Corkery, the director of the Sierra Club’s New Hampshire chapter, said in an email. “He has adamantly opposed clean energy access and expansion. He has avoided addressing the climate crisis and the risks it presents to public health, infrastructure, and the underserved in the Granite State. That is a fact.” “I planted more trees than any of the candidates that are running together, you know, at any point in time.” While newly planted trees do absorb carbon from the atmosphere, “a lot of landscaping comes from new construction, which involves clearing forest land, especially in northern New England,” said Jack Dibb, a tree farmer and research professor at the University of New Hampshire’s Earth Systems Research Center. “So the net is usually a lot less trees, and something way different than a healthy forest,” Dibb said over email. “Landscaping relatively small lots in a development really does not contribute in a significant way.” Morse did not respond to an email sent Monday night requesting comment. Morse is the third candidate to jump into the race against Hassan. National Republicans heavily recruited Gov. Chris Sununu to run. But in November, he held a press conference and surprised everyone by announcing that he instead was going to seek a fourth term as governor. Republicans see Hassan’s seat as a potential pickup opportunity in the tight battle for control of the Senate. Besides Morse, former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc are running for the GOP nomination. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Red States’ Wolf Decimation Campaign Hasn’t Worked,environment," National Reporter, HuffPost Idaho and Montana both passed controversial laws last year with the goal of sharply reducing their gray wolf populations. The Idaho law gained national attention over reports that the state aimed to eradicate up to 90% of its gray wolves. If that's the plan, it hasn’t worked yet. The number of gray wolves killed by hunters and trappers fell within the ranges documented for the last few years, according to data released by both states last week. Neither state showed an unusual spike in wolf deaths. In Montana, hunters and trappers have killed 189 wolves since the 2021-22 wolf-hunting season began — about average for this time of year. Idaho documented 300 wolf deaths by the end of December. That figure, which includes natural mortality and wolves killed for livestock predation, is higher than it was at the same time a year prior, but lower than in 2019. Idaho’s gray wolf population stood at 1,543 as of Aug. 1, according to a state estimate based on computer analysis of millions of trail camera images — about two dozen fewer wolves than at the same time in 2019. “We don’t know where it’s going to end up,” Idaho Fish and Game spokesperson Roger Phillips said. “There’s still plenty of hunting and trapping season out there. But so far, we’re not seeing it tracking differently than it has for previous years.” The Idaho legislature caused a major uproar last year by passing a law slashing restrictions on the state’s already-liberal regulations for hunting and trapping wolves. Hunters and trappers may now legally kill an unlimited number of wolves. They can hunt wolves at night and while using motor vehicles. The law allows the contracting of third parties to target wolves. Former wildlife officials criticized the legislature for usurping wildlife management from state agencies, while environmentalist and animal rights groups decried the law as an open wolf slaughter and urged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to put wolves in the Northern Rockies back under the protection of the Endangered Species Act. Montana also passed laws targeting wolves last year, though legislators left the state’s Fish, Wildlife and Parks agency largely in charge of regulating the wolf harvest, eliminating one of the Idaho law’s most contentious elements. Ranchers championed the Idaho bill, saying the growing wolf population was eating into their bottom line. Wolves kill only a small number of domestic cows each year. But in areas where they are present in large numbers, they tend to push and stress cattle herds, delaying their weight gain. Profit in cattle ranching depends on moving the livestock from birth- to slaughter-weight quickly. Nothing in the Idaho law specifies how many or what percentage of wolves hunters and trappers should kill. But Idaho agreed to maintain a minimum of 150 wolves when the federal government delisted wolves in the Northern Rockies from the Endangered Species Act. Critics who said the Idaho bill would result in the killing of 90% of the state’s wolves came up with that number by reasoning that 150 is 10% of the state’s total wolf population of 1,500. It takes more than legal changes, however, to kill that many wolves. Both states had already made it cheap for people to buy lots of the tags they needed to hunt or trap wolves, over lengthy seasons, especially on private land. But wolves roam huge swaths of unpopulated land in those states. They routinely cover distances of 20 miles, mostly at night. And the fur market doesn’t offer prices high enough to motivate significant numbers of people to specialize in trapping wolves. The result is that the vast majority of people who buy a tag allowing them to kill a wolf never fill it. While the Idaho law hasn’t yet decimated its wolf population, some of its backers view it as a minor victory that the state’s estimate shows the wolf population dropped by about two dozen in the last two years, after a period of rapid growth. “We are grateful to see that it’s declining slightly,” said Chyla Wilson, a spokesperson for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, a major backer of the wolf bill. “It will be interesting to see where it goes in the next couple of years. We obviously don’t think the population will go down a substantial amount ― not even close to 90%. But we do want to see a slow decrease to reduce conflicts.” Last week’s numbers add a new dimension to the rekindled debate over whether the federal government should protect gray wolves in the Northern Rockies under the Endangered Species Act. USFWS is considering an emergency listing for gray wolves in Idaho and Montana, but will not likely rule for several months. Some suspect that the laws’ full effects remain unknown, partly due to harsh winter weather that might have kept some hunters and trappers from the field. “It’s extremely early to estimate how many wolves are going to be killed with these new laws in place,” said Andrea Zaccardi, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity. “The wolf killing numbers are still extremely high. They were high before these laws and I think they’ll remain high and even be higher.” While Montana’s overall wolf population didn’t nosedive, the new laws profoundly affected wolf populations near Yellowstone National Park. Montana wildlife officials had previously imposed a hunting quota of one wolf in each of the two hunting units where most of the park’s wolves have historically gotten killed. After the legal changes, the state replaced the unit-based quotas with a region-wide target of 82 wolves. That change hammered Yellowstone wolves. Hunters and trappers killed a total of 23 wolves on Yellowstone’s borders, reducing the park’s wolf population by 20% and eliminating one of its packs. Montana’s wildlife commission voted 7-0 on Friday to keep the hunting season open until meeting the 82-wolf threshold, over the objections of Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cameron Sholly. Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) also killed a Yellowstone wolf in February of last year, though that was before the legal changes and before the current hunting and trapping season began. Gianforte received a reprimand from a state agency he oversees for failing to complete a required course before doing so. A combination of commercialized hunting and government poisoning campaigns to protect livestock eradicated gray wolves from the West by the early 20th century. Yellowstone National Park served as the main site of their reintroduction to the Northern Rockies in 1995. The park does not permit hunting, and wolves have flourished there. Visitors hope to see them, and people have followed the wolves’ lives from afar through the animals’ biologist-assigned numbers. Park officials called the wolf deaths “a significant setback for the species’ long-term viability and for wolf research” in a statement to The Associated Press. National Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Dolce & Gabbana Will Drop Animal Fur Starting In 2022,environment," MILAN (AP) — Dolce & Gabbana announced Monday that it would drop the use of animal fur in all its collections starting this year, and transition to eco-friendly faux fur. The Milan fashion house joins other luxury brands, including Armani, Gucci, Prada and Moncler, in adhering to guidelines set by the Fur Free Alliance, a network of animal rights groups around the world. “Dolce & Gabbana is working toward a more sustainable future that can’t contemplate the use of animal fur,” Dolce & Gabbana communications and marketing officer Fedele Usai said in a statement. PJ Smith, the fashion policy director of the Human Society of the United States and the Humane Society International, said “ending the use of fur creates a higher standard for what is acceptable in fashion.” Italy has banned fur farming from this year, joining about 20 countries that have either banned or limited fur farming over the last two decades."
14,"Male Penguin Couple Doing 'Great Job' Raising Foster Hatchling, New York Zoo Says",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Two male Humboldt penguins at a New York zoo who adopted an egg last year have become parents to a brand-new hatchling. The same-sex foster couple, Elmer and Lima, are a first for the Rosamond Gifford Zoo, which is based in Syracuse, though a number of other zoos around the world have also had same-sex penguins successfully incubate eggs and raise chicks. The Rosamond Gifford Zoo said on its website that it has had at least two breeding pairs of penguins accidentally break their fertilized eggs in the past. To improve the chances of hatching a chick, zookeepers may give an egg to a more successful pair. Zoo Director Ted Fox said that not all penguin pairs are good at incubating eggs: “It takes practice.” Elmer and Lima were given a dummy egg last year and “were exemplary in every aspect of egg care,” Fox said. That prompted zookeepers to give them an egg laid by another couple before Christmas. The penguin dads took turns incubating the egg until it hatched on New Year’s Day. They’ve been warming and feeding the chick ever since. “It continues to be brooded and cared for by both Elmer and Lima, who are doing a great job. And once they have experience doing this and continue to do it well, they will be considered to foster future eggs,” Fox said. Many other institutions have had good experiences with same-sex penguin foster couples in recent years. These include Electra and Viola, two female gentoo penguins at the Oceanogràfic València aquarium in Spain; Skipper and Ping, a pair of male king penguins at the Berlin Zoo; and Eduardo and Rio, both male Magellanic penguins, at the San Francisco Zoo. Fox said these examples show that the idea of “family” is not dependent on species and that many different kinds of families thrive at raising children. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Winter Weather Disappears From Winter Olympics And Athletes Worry,environment," Ski racers settling into the start gate for Alpine World Cup events in the Rocky Mountains in early December squinted through sunshine that carried the temperature toward 50 degrees and glanced down at a course covered with pristine — and manufactured — snow. If they looked up and across the way, beyond the finish line, they saw adjacent hills that were brown and barren as can be, with nary a trace of powder or any indication that this was a setting for athletes who would be heading to the Beijing Olympics that begin Feb. 4. It is a troubling reality and — given their own reliance on the production of snow, continent-hopping flights powered by diesel fuel and other environment-unfriendly offshoots of their careers — hard-to-reconcile push-and-pull for many of those who will be competing in Alpine skiing or freestyle skiing or snowboarding or Nordic combined events or other outdoor sports that helped put the disappearing “Winter” in Winter Games. “Climate change is here. It’s happening. We’re living in it right now. It’s not something that’s going to be in the distant future. It’s here. And you see it with the fires in California, floods in Europe, higher snow levels, shorter winters, longer summers, droughts. It runs the whole gamut. Everywhere in the world is having some effect from it. And there’s not really any turning back,” said Travis Ganong, a 33-year-old from California going to China with the U.S. ski team. “Selfishly, I hope winters are here in the future,” he said. “But it’s not looking good.” Global warming is altering, and endangering, his and other sports, perhaps permanently, and not just at the elite level. It affects folks who just want to ski or snowboard for fun and those who make a living from places offering such activities. And, well, everyone on the planet, of course, because this affects far more than sports, of course. Just one example: In December, Colorado set a record that stood since the 1880s for most consecutive days without snow. After warm temperatures and just an inch of snowfall by Dec. 30, wind-fueled wildfires destroyed hundreds of homes in the state. The last eight years rank as the eight hottest on record for Earth, according to two U.S. science agencies, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The glaciers are receding. The winter is starting later and ending sooner,” said John Kucera, the 2009 world champion in downhill who now is a coach for Canada’s Alpine team. “For a sport like ours, we might pay for it sooner than some others. We are dependent on the climate and the weather and that dictates what we’re able to do.” The fallout is widespread. It’s harder to find glaciers suitable for training, so athletes need to search for new locales — or even head indoors. It’s harder to hold World Cup events, because too much wind or too much snow or too little snow leads to postponements or cancellations. It’s harder to find real snow anywhere, so competition increasingly comes on machine-made snow, which has its own deleterious effects on the environment. While the high speeds, steep inclines and sharp angles make danger a constant presence in Alpine skiing, no matter what sort of stuff is underfoot, injury-causing crashes are increasingly common in Nordic skiing and biathlon because the snow created by people produces harder, slicker tracks. “We definitely have noticed a lack of snow everywhere. Places that, in December, November, used to be ‘winter wonderlands,’ we’re seeing them with less and less snow. And some years, they’re not getting any snow,” said Taylor Fletcher, who grew up in Colorado, is based in Utah, and made his fourth Olympic team in Nordic combined. Plenty of Winter Olympians share similar observations. “I’m no meteorologist,” Italy’s Marta Bassino, last season’s World Cup giant slalom discipline winner, said with a chuckle, “but I see it with my eyes.” Alexis Pinturault, a three-time Olympic medalist for France, recalls hitting the slopes at Tignes in his country’s Alps 20 years ago, but notes “it’s nearly impossible to ski there anymore.” U.S. aerials skier Winter Vinecki remembers an event in Belarus where, instead of a season-appropriate setting, she competed amid water puddles. Explains Taylor Gold, an American snowboarder who is part of Protect Our Winters, an athlete-driven environmental group: “The absolute ideal scenario would be to have a halfpipe made entirely of natural snow, but that’s just never possible anymore.” A study recently published in “Current Issues in Tourism” projected that without a dramatic reduction of global emissions of greenhouse gases, only one of the previous 21 Winter Olympics sites would be able to reliably provide fair and safe conditions by the end of this century. Researchers from Austria, Canada and the U.S. determined that even with emissions on the lower end of the scale, just three of 12 European cities that have hosted Winter Games would be a reliable site by the 2050s. “Part of what we do papers like this for is to get the message out that we have a large influence ... and so, if we act, (there is) hope of avoiding those worst-case scenarios,” said Daniel Scott, a professor at the University of Waterloo who co-authored the study, “Climate change and the future of the Olympic Winter Games: athlete and coach perspectives.”"

0,'Mr. Goodbar' Mexican Gray Wolf Thwarted By Trump's Border Wall Has Been Shot,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A young Mexican gray wolf recently thwarted in his search for a mate by Donald Trump’s border wall has been shot, researchers have reported. The 2-year-old male, known to scientists as “Mr. Goodbar,” is expected to live but will likely have all or part of his right hind leg amputated, according to a statement from the nonprofit conservation organization the Center for Biological Diversity. An investigation has been launched to track Mr. Goodbar’s shooter. Mexican gray wolves are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. The maximum penalty for violating the law is a year in jail and a $50,000 fine. “Mr. Goodbar’s painful experiences illustrate the inhospitable world we’ve created for Mexican gray wolves and other vulnerable animals,” Michael Robinson, a senior conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “We hope the criminal who shot Mr. Goodbar will be brought to justice.” The endangered Mexican gray #wolf who spent five days trying to get around the border wall in New Mexico before turning back was found shot but alive Wednesday. Anyone with information should call 1-844-397-8477 or email fws_tips@fws.gov. https://t.co/p5pkVUuuSy Mr. Goodbar’s injury was spotted during an annual count by helicopter of the Mexican gray wolves in the Southwest by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He was tranquilized with a dart fired from a helicopter and transported for treatment to the Albuquerque BioPark Zoo, the Center for Biological Diversity reported. He made news earlier this month as the first tracked wolf to prove the Trump border wall is creating a problem for endangered species. Mr. Goodbar left his pack in eastern Arizona last year and roamed for months to strike out on his own to start his own family in new territory. He was finally stopped in southern New Mexico in late November — not by the challenges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but by Trump’s 30-foot-high border barrier. The young wolf trotted along the wall for days, likely looking for an opening, which would have provided the possibility of mating with Mexican gray wolves on the other side of the border. But he finally turned back north again, and ended up close to his old territory. The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups are now battling to open up the border wall in “priority” areas identified as important for animals — not just wolves, but for pronghorn, cougars, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, kit fox and ringtail. The reintroduced Mexican gray wolf population numbered some 186 in Arizona and New Mexico in the last count in 2020 (there were 30 across the border in Mexico). This year, the tally will likely be higher, Robinson said. But the species risks extinction by inbreeding without more genetic diversity, which requires large swaths of unimpeded range for the animals to branch out. “These wolves are beautiful, intelligent, social animals that we should want to save just because of empathy,” Robinson told HuffPost. “And because we played a role in their decimation, we have an obligation to help them.” While the Mexican gray wolf remains listed as an endangered species under the law, the Trump administration dropped the classification for other wolves, triggering major hunts in some areas.

1,It Turns Out Orcas Can — And Do — Kill And Eat Blue Whales,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Its sheer size apparently isn’t enough to save a blue whale from becoming dinner for a hungry pod of orcas (aka killer whales). In a paper published last week in the journal Marine Mammal Science, researchers shared “the first documentation of killer whales killing and eating blue whales: two individuals killed, 16 days apart in 2019, and a third in 2021.” Happy to share our new publication reporting on the first records of #killerwhales predating on the largest animals on the planet- blue whales. This was a collaborative effort between scientists & tourism operators.The #Bremer #orca yet again teaching us something new! Link below pic.twitter.com/8Gn0It9RvK In the past, there have been reports of orcas chasing blue whales, but this the first official scientific record of orcas successfully hunting, killing and eating them, according to The Guardian. The incidents all happened in Australia’s Bremer Bay, where female-led orca groups worked together to take down their large prey. In two of the three cases, the blue whales — which are the largest animals on Earth — weren’t fully grown: one was a young calf and one was a juvenile around a year old. But the third blue whale the orcas ate was a healthy adult between 60 and 70 feet long, more than twice the size of the largest orcas, which only get to be about 30 feet, according to National Geographic. “When we arrived about 14 killer whales were attacking the blue in [230-ft deep] waters, with the female killer whales leading the attack,” Isabella Reeves, a PhD candidate at Australia’s Flinders University and one of the study’s authors, told New Atlas. That attack involved some of the orcas repeatedly slamming into the blue whale and biting off chunks of its flesh, while others went for its head and still another took the liberty of going for the tongue ― a nutrient-dense organ that orcas apparently love. Ultimately, about 50 orcas joined in the smorgasbord. While you may have trouble convincing a blue whale of this, the researchers believe that the orca attacks may actually be a positive sign overall, indicating that blue whale numbers are rebounding after being driven to near-extinction by the whaling industry in the early 20th century. “Maybe what we’re starting to see now is how the ocean used to be before we took out most of the large whales,” Robert Pitman, an ecologist at Oregon State University and another of the study’s authors, told The Guardian. “As some of these populations continue to recover, we have a better chance to see how normal marine ecosystems function.” In the meantime, orcas aren’t the only animals enjoying the feast, Gizmodo reported. In the case of the adult whale, the carcass also became a buffet for sharks and scavenging seabirds. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
2,"Coal-Loving Australia’s Pledge To Protect Great Barrier Reef ‘Utter Bulls**t,’ Detractors Say",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Australian government on Friday said it would invest $700 million to protect the Great Barrier Reef, a natural crown jewel rapidly deteriorating due to climate change, but the plan prompted swift backlash from scientists and environmentalists who say the effort does little to address our warming world. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the new funding would be spent over the next nine years, bolstering a $1.4 billion effort, called the Reef 2050 Plan, through investments that would improve water quality, tackle outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish and invest in reef science. But the plan barely addresses the root cause of the Great Barrier Reef’s demise: Quickly warming waters linked to climate change. The landmark has been hit by five bouts of mass coral bleaching since 1998, including back-to-back events in 2016, 2017 and 2020 that left huge swaths of the structure sickened or dead. (Bleaching happens most often when warmer-than-usual waters sit atop delicate reefs, effectively cooking coral polyps.) Terry Hughes, a professor at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said the plan amounted to “utter bullshit,” calling it merely a Band-Aid “to protect fossil fuels.” “Australia is a laggard on climate change — still encouraging more fossil fuels, and scientists know that we CAN’T ‘build a healthy resilient reef in the face of climate change’ without tackling rising emissions,” he wrote on Twitter. “The new funding will support the deployment of new technologies…. coral seeding, the development of heat-resistant coral and climate adaptation work with turtles and other marine species.”It’s utter bullshit - bandaids to protect fossil fuels.https://t.co/NQp4GeTbYP New funding announcement shows Morrison Government will do almost anything to protect the Reef, except address climate change https://t.co/0VjcuehIeU #auspol #GBR #GreatBarrierReef .@sussanley .@ScottMorrisonMP pic.twitter.com/tkHCO9k2BY Australia’s conservative government has drawn fierce criticism for its ongoing support of the fossil fuel industry, and a November report found 116 major coal and gas projects are in development across the country. The nation’s emissions strategies are currently ranked as “highly insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker, and Morrison has refused to update 2030 emissions reduction targets and vowed to support the coal industry for “decades to come.” “I make no apologies for Australia’s standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or economic interests,” Morrison, who faces an election later this year, said in November at the United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow. “We have a balanced plan to achieve net zero by 2050, but we’re not going to make rural and regional Australians pay for that.” Many scientists argue, however, that 2050 will be far too late to stop runaway climate change, especially for already vulnerable structures like the Great Barrier Reef. Reef advocates also point to the 64,000 jobs supported directly by tourism along the Australian coastline. (The $1 billion figure referenced in the tweets below is in Australian dollars.) The Federal Government has announced $1 billion dollars in funding for the Great Barrier Reef, on top of $2 billion already announced.But it remains to be seen whether it's enough to avoid UNESCO placing the reef on it's ""in danger"" list.@sussanleyhttps://t.co/dTAS9OeEdl Sussan Ley, the country’s environment minister, said Friday that Australia isn’t “sitting on our hands” when it comes to addressing climate change, and she pushed back on concerns that the nation wasn’t doing its fair share to address fossil fuel emissions. “Our focus for improving the long-term outlook of the reef is on three key areas, one of them is global emissions reductions... but of course it’s a global issue requiring a global response,” she said. Ley went on to say that critics try to claim “Australia’s emissions are the only emissions responsible for the state of the reef, and that’s clearly not the case.” “We know that we can help build a healthy, resilient reef in the face of climate change while playing our part.” Those statements were met with frustration from opposition lawmakers, who linked aggressive action on climate change to true protection for the reef. After almost a decade in office the Morrison-Joyce government is admitting that it has failed to do enough for the Reef.They’re not serious about acting on climate change, which means they are not serious about standing up for the Reef.#auspol The damage and ongoing threats to the reef are so great that UNESCO, the United Nations body that monitors the world’s areas of great significance, threatened to downgrade the Great Barrier Reef to “in danger” status. Doing so would have been deeply embarrassing, but the Australian government successfully lobbied to prevent it from happening in the short term. A vote on the matter will be held later this year, after the Australian federal election. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Court Invalidates Biden Administration's 'Carbon Bomb' Oil Lease Sale,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A federal judge on Thursday vacated dozens of oil and gas leases that fossil fuel companies secured late last year in the Gulf of Mexico, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held its massive offshore auction. The ruling is a major win for environmental groups that sued to block what many described as a ticking “carbon bomb.” Judge Rudolph Contreras, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, sided with plaintiffs in the case, who argued that the Department of the Interior relied on a faulty analysis that underestimated the planet-warming greenhouse gases and associated environmental effects from future drilling and development of the leases. Interior “acted arbitrarily and capriciously in excluding foreign consumption from their greenhouse gas emissions calculation,” Contreras wrote. The offshore sale — the largest in U.S. history — offered up more than 80 million acres of the Gulf at auction. Companies ultimately bid more than $191 million for rights to drill across more than 1.7 million offshore acres — an area larger than the state of Delaware. “We are pleased that the court invalidated Interior’s illegal lease sale,” Brettny Hardy, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, which represented several environmental organizations in the lawsuit, said in a statement. “We simply cannot continue to make investments in the fossil fuel industry to the peril of our communities and increasingly warming planet.” Hardy added it is time for the administration to follow through on President Joe Biden’s campaign promises to ban new federal fossil-fuel leasing. “We can no longer afford to do anything less,” she said. The Biden administration has argued it had no choice but to move forward with the offshore sale after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana struck down Biden’s executive order in January 2021 temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters. But environmental lawyers insisted that the administration had options for scaling back, delaying or halting it, including requesting that an appeals court stay — or suspend — the injunction. Melissa Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Interior Department, reiterated that the administration’s hands were tied. “To comply with the injunction imposed in the District Court of Louisiana litigation, we were compelled to proceed with Lease Sale 257 based on the previous administration’s environmental analysis and its decision to approve the lease sale,” she said via email. “We are reviewing the Court’s decision concerning deficiencies in that record. “Our public lands and waters must be protected for generations to come,” she added. “We have documented serious deficiencies in the federal oil and gas program. Especially in the face of the climate crisis, we need to take the time to make significant and long overdue programmatic reforms. Our work will be guided by the law, science and sound policy.” The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil and gas lobby and an intervening defendant in the case, called the judge’s decision “disappointing” and said it is considering its options. “Offshore energy development plays a critical role in strengthening our nation’s economy and energy security,” API spokesperson Scott Lauermann said via email. The now-revoked lease sale dwarfed the Trump administration’s final Gulf auction in 2020, when 518,000 acres went for $121 million, and threatened to lock in decades of future drilling and greenhouse gas emissions. By Interior’s own estimates, it was expected to lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades. “Today’s decision is a victorious outcome not only for the Gulf’s communities, wildlife, and ecosystem, but also for the warming planet,” Hallie Templeton, legal director at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

7,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(Hint: It’s nothing.) “The Daily Show” correspondent interviewed supporters of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Mississippi to see if the damning evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating the U.S. Capitol attack, was cutting through at all. Most people said they weren’t watching the hearings. Two women didn’t even know what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. And, as Klepper observed, “For almost everyone here, insurrectioning was a non-issue. It was the hearings themselves that were the problem.” And when Klepper showed attendees footage of former Attorney General William Barr saying Trump’s electoral fraud claims were “bullshit” and Ivanka Trump saying she believed Barr, they still didn’t buy it.

10,"Ozzie, World's Oldest Male Gorilla, Dies At Atlanta Zoo At Age Of 61",environment," ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The world’s oldest male gorilla, named Ozzie, was found dead by his care team at the Atlanta zoo Tuesday, zoo officials announced. Ozzie was 61. The cause of the gorilla’s death was not immediately known though Ozzie began showing signs of low appetite last week, the zoo said in a news release. The zoo’s veterinary team treated Ozzie for symptoms including facial swelling, weakness and inability to eat or drink fluids. Ozzie, a lowland gorilla, was the world’s oldest male gorilla and the third-oldest gorilla in the world. “This is a devastating loss for Zoo Atlanta,” said Raymond Kind, president and CEO of the zoo. “Ozzie’s life’s contributions are indelible, in the generations of individuals he leaves behind in the gorilla population and in the world’s body of knowledge in the care of his species.” A necropsy will be performed by the University of Georgia Zoo and Exotic Animal Pathology Service in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the news release said. Ozzie was the only surviving member of a generation brought to Zoo Atlanta with the opening of The Ford African Rain Forest in 1988. He became the world’s first gorilla in the world to participate in a voluntary blood pressure reading in 2009. The primate is survived by seven descendants at the Atlanta zoo and many other offspring at other zoos in the United States and Canada, the news release stated. Lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered because of poaching, habitat loss, and drastic population reductions from disease. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, their numbers have decreased by 60 percent and as much as 90 percent in some parts of western Africa."
11,Biden Administration Revokes Mining Leases Near Minnesota's Boundary Waters,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A Chilean mining giant’s bid to construct a massive underground copper-nickel mine just a few miles from Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has hit another major snag. On Wednesday, the Biden administration canceled a pair of mineral leases that date back to the 1960s, concluding that the Trump administration skirted legal obligations when it renewed the leases in 2019. “The Department of the Interior takes seriously our obligations to steward public lands and waters on behalf of all Americans,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement announcing the decision. “We must be consistent in how we apply lease terms to ensure that no lessee receives special treatment.” Twin Metals Minnesota, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta, has, for years, been trying to mine at the doorstep of the 1.09 million-acre Boundary Waters — the most visited wilderness area in the country. Opponents argue that allowing the project to move ahead could forever sully the vast network of federally protected rivers, lakes and creeks, often pointing to the hard-rock mining industry’s long legacy of polluting water resources across the country. Extracting sulfide-bearing minerals like those Twin Metals is after could trigger the release of toxic sulfuric acid that can persist indefinitely. In a legal opinion on Wednesday, Ann Marie Bledsoe Downes, the Interior Department’s principal deputy solicitor, wrote that the Trump administration had “improperly” renewed the leases and violated department regulations by “customizing lease terms specifically for Twin Metals.” The Trump family has ties to Andrónico Luksic, the Chilean billionaire behind the mine, and Twin Metals spent more than $1 million lobbying government agencies during Trump’s tenure, according to federal filings. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups cheered Wednesday’s announcement. “Some places are simply too special to mine, and it is our obligation to ensure these unique and valuable lands and waters remain intact for generations to come,” Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) said in a statement. Becky Rom, national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, said the decision “marks a return for the rule of law.” “Twin Metals leases should never have been reinstated in the first place, and this announcement should stop the Twin Metals mine threat,” she added. The lease cancelation is the latest in a long fight spanning multiple administrations. In the final weeks of President Barack Obama’s administration, federal agencies revoked Twin Metals’ leases, citing environmental concerns, and ordered a review of potential impacts. The Trump administration moved quickly to revive the project, ending the Obama-era study and renewing the leases in May 2019. Twin Metals Minnesota blasted the Biden administration’s decision and accused it of trying to “shut the door on copper-nickel mining in northeast Minnesota.” “We will challenge this attempt to stop our project and defend our valid existing mineral rights,” the company said. “We expect to prevail.” Separate from Wednesday’s decision, the Biden administration is considering an application from the U.S. Forest Service for a 20-year mining ban on more than 200,000 acres of national forest land south of the Boundary Waters. As part of that two-year review, no new mining activity is allowed. Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,There Will Be No Natural Snow At The Winter Olympics In Beijing,environment," National Reporter, HuffPost When athletes take to the slopes outside Beijing next week for the 2022 Winter Olympics, they’ll do so atop 100% man-made snow for the first time in the history of the games. Nature hasn’t graced the region with anything greater than trace amounts of the white stuff, nor was it expected to: Across the months of November, December and January, Beijing averages just 11 millimeters — about four-tenths of an inch — of precipitation. Instead, snow guns and lances supplied by TechnoAlpin, an Italian snowmaking supplier, are running around the clock to coat venues in man-made powder. A TechnoAlpin sales manager told Sports Illustrated that the company has 170 fan-powered guns and 30 fanless snow lances at Yanqing, the alpine skiing venue; 40 guns and 15 lances at the Zhangjiakou nordic center; 62 guns and 30 lances at the freestyle park; and seven lances running in downtown Beijing for the big air event. All of that will require an estimated 49 million gallons of water, drawn from reservoirs in a region the International Olympic Committee acknowledges already “suffers from severe water stress and ... is becoming increasingly arid.” The water is chemically treated to resist melting, mixed with air and blasted aloft in freezing temperatures, ultimately falling to the ground as a denser, harder version of real snow. In an emailed statement, the IOC said Beijing 2022 implemented “water-conserving and recycling designs” to minimize waste, including capturing snowmelt in retaining lakes. The IOC also noted that chemical additives are only being used to make snow in one of the four venues; the other three are sufficiently cold to naturally keep the snow from melting. Past Winter Olympics have struggled with less-than-ideal conditions as well, but never to this extent. A Bloomberg report found that 80% of the snow at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, was man-made, and that 90% of the white stuff in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was fake. But both regions receive significantly more yearly precipitation than Beijing. Absent urgent steps to reverse climate change, we should expect winter sports to look more like this in the future, according to a report published Wednesday by an environmental group called Sport Ecology Group at Loughborough University in England and Protect Our Winters. Only 10 of the 21 venues used for the Winter Games since 1924 will have the “climate suitability” and snowfall levels necessary to host by 2050, the authors concluded. Snowmaking technology can be a useful stopgap, but it’s no substitute for the real thing, Peter Speight, a British freestyle champion and Winter Olympian, told the report’s authors. “It’s helpful for creating physical snow for people to use, but it uses large amounts of water and energy and does not help solve climate change,” Speight said. “We need to solve climate change at the source (reduce greenhouse gas emissions), rather than rely on mitigation focused solutions.” National Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Leopard vs. Porcupine Showdown Does Not End Well For One Of Them,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Curiosity quilled the cat. A young leopard hunting a porcupine in South Africa tried to play it cool, but got too aggressive and paid the price. (Watch the video below.) In video shot by Jaco De Swardt and posted recently by the wildlife site Latest Sightings, the leopard casually grooms itself as the porcupine watches nearby on the road in Kruger National Park. The tension escalates and the leopard eventually abandons nonchalance and aggressively paws at the critter. The porcupine hisses and jabs a needle right through the leopard’s paw, leaving the cat licking its wound while the prickly critter saunters off. Porcupines can be covered by more than 30,000 quills, according to National Geographic. Just one taught this leopard a painful lesson. And it isn’t the first time porcupines emerged victorious against leopards. Leopards do kill and eat porcupines, but there’s a learning curve ahead for this youngster.

14,Sundance Doc ‘To The End’ Tells A Bleak Yet Empowering Story About Climate Change,environment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost During the 2018 midterm elections, documentary filmmaker Rachel Lears chronicled four progressive women who mounted primary challenges against establishment Democrats in Congress. One of them was now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose successful grassroots campaign shook up the political landscape and put the party’s old guard on notice. As Lears was wrapping up the film, 2019’s “Knock Down the House,” she knew she wanted to keep following Ocasio-Cortez. Around that same time, in the fall of 2018, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its most sobering report yet, warning that world leaders were rapidly running out of time to prevent environmental catastrophe. So Lears turned her attention toward the politics of climate change, following Ocasio-Cortez as well as three Green New Deal activists and progressive leaders: Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement, Alexandra Rojas of Justice Democrats and Rhiana Gunn-Wright of the Roosevelt Institute. The result is “To the End,” which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival. In a conversation with HuffPost, Lears talked about the significance of all four of the documentary’s protagonists being young women of color, how the COVID-19 pandemic made the themes even more grimly resonant, and why the activists maintain optimism and momentum in the face of so much defeat, intransigence, and being continually underestimated. After completing “Knock Down the House,” Lears said she wanted to continue exploring women and women of color in leadership. In particular, it became clear these new generations of leaders would come up against the tension of “how you leverage the power that you have while trying to build more at the same time, and confronting what the limits of the power that you have,” she said. “[It's] not a coincidence that these four leaders and many young leaders in the climate justice movement are women of color.” “I was very interested in what it was going to look like, not only for Ocasio-Cortez to enter Congress and confront the realities of whatever she was going to find there in the institutions of our government,” Lears explained. “But once the Green New Deal started exploding, it also became clear that these other young women who are in positions of leadership in this movement were also going to be facing a similar challenge around leadership and power, and just what is it like to have one foot in the door of the halls of power, but not to have enough power to fully shape your own agenda.” In addition, as Lears pointed out, it’s “not a coincidence that these four leaders and many young leaders in the climate justice movement are women of color.” “Young people, women and people of color are, across the world, the most affected by the climate crisis at the front lines,” she said. “Women of color have been leading movements as long as there have been movements, but they don’t always get memorialized in the official histories. And that’s starting to change, obviously, but it’s incredibly important to recognize the work that these people are doing and to acknowledge their central role in this.” Lears’ prior film “Knock Down the House” was similarly noteworthy in how, unlike many campaign documentaries, its subjects were women and women of color. For the filmmaker, there are multiple reasons why this matters. On one level, it’s powerful and meaningful for people to see themselves represented. “On the other hand, I also think there’s a really interesting cultural shift that happens when people from dominant groups start to identify with people from marginalized groups as characters, because that’s the opposite of what I grew up with, identifying with male characters in movies and television because there just weren’t enough female characters,” she said. “So I’m trying to make movies that are constructed in a way to really draw people into empathy and identifying with this character-based narrative journey. And I think that can have really profound cultural implications when it’s cast this way.” The events in “To the End” span the last three years. Like everything else in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a lot of logistical challenges for Lears, the documentary’s protagonists and the production team. At the same time, she discovered that narratively, the pandemic was all a “massive validation of the themes that we had already been exploring.” “We had already been exploring the way that crises play out along the lines of economic and racial inequality,” Lears said. “Boom, the pandemic hits. And that is just blatantly obvious to everyone that that’s what is happening.” One of the film’s major storylines is the push and pull between activists and elected officials. The activists recognize they’re dealing with a deeply flawed political system, but also understand the need to work within it in order to achieve real change. And Ocasio-Cortez plays a crucial role as a liaison between the activists and the old guard Democratic leaders. “To actually get what we demand requires us to work with institutions and established powers that we loathe,” Ocasio-Cortez says in the film. “Sometimes, I feel like my job is to get my hands dirty so that community organizers and activists don’t have to.” In another scene, Prakash similarly reflects on how it can be “too icky” to deal with flawed and corrupt institutions, and whether to engage with political power is a source of debate within the progressive movement. But “as mind-blowingly frustrating as it can be,” Lears said, there’s still a need to do so. “At the end of the day, we need both. We need electoral movements and community-based movements and labor movements,” she said. “Electoral politics isn’t the only arena for deciding these things. But it is important. And as Varshini says, our enemy, and she’s talking about the fossil fuel industry, is working out their political strategy and spending billions of dollars on it.” The documentary tells a compelling story about the challenges of progressive organizing and trying to remain steadfast when it’s hard not to feel cynical and demoralized. But as the climate crisis has grown direr and more people experience the effects of rising sea levels, worsening air and water pollution, and intensifying natural disasters, “we don’t have the luxury of cynicism,” Lears said. It’s something that clearly drives the protagonists in “To the End.” “That sort of visceral distaste for politics, I think it’s connected to the cynicism that so many people feel when they watch the gridlock and just the way that so many people in Congress will prioritize their donors or corporate interests above what the majority of working people in this country actually want to see,” Lears said. “I can see why people feel distaste for that. I do myself. But it’s really interesting to follow the story of people who are trying to walk that line and trying to stay true to their values while engaging within the system. And all of the people featured in this film are; they get tons of flack, literally from left, right and center.” “They’re being criticized from people on all parts of the political spectrum for being too much of this, too little of that. But they’re trying to be idealistic and pragmatic at the same time,” Lears continued. “I think watching these courageous young women really live through that is an incredibly emotional roller coaster.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Rihanna’s Foundation Donates $15 Million To Climate Justice,environment," Rihanna is backing her belief that climate change is a social-justice issue by pledging $15 million to the movement through her Clara Lionel Foundation. The “We Found Love” singer on Tuesday announced the donation to 18 climate justice organizations doing work in seven Caribbean nations and the United States. They include the Climate Justice Alliance, the Indigenous Environmental Network, and the Movement for Black Lives. “Climate disasters, which are growing in frequency and intensity, do not impact all communities equally, with communities of color and island nations facing the brunt of climate change,” Rihanna, who is from the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados, said in a statement. She noted that disparity is the reason her foundation, which is named after her grandparents, prioritizes both climate resilience and climate justice work. The grants, made in partnership with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s #StartSmall philanthropic initiative, are focused on groups with female, LGBT, and Black and Indigenous leaders because their communities are at the greatest risk. “Funders must build partnerships with grassroots organizations, acknowledging their deep understanding of what is necessary to achieve climate justice in their own communities,” Justine Lucas, Clara Lionel Foundation’s executive director, said in a statement."

0,Endangered Wolf Thwarted In Love By Trump's Border Wall,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A lone endangered Mexican gray wolf likely seeking a mate has been thwarted by American politics — in the form of Donald Trump’s massive border wall. The male wolf, known as Mr. Goodbar to researchers, left his pack in eastern Arizona and roamed for months in a drive to start his own family. He was finally stopped in southern New Mexico in late November — not by the challenges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but by a 30-foot-high border barrier. Before Trump launched his wall campaign, the area was unbroken habitat, according to wildlife experts. Still, Mr. Goodbar sought an opening, and spent days trotting 23 miles along the wall, likely seeking a spot where he could resume his travels south. He eventually gave up and headed back north close to his old territory. His challenges were tracked by a GPS collar attached by staffers of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, providing some of the first concrete proof of border wall wildlife dangers that environmentalists had feared. “I wasn’t surprised because we had predicted it,” Michael Robinson, a senior conservation advocate for the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, told the National Geographic magazine this week. “But I was bummed out.” Mr. Goodbar is just one animal, but the border wall poses a challenge to countless other wolves — as well as to pronghorn, cougars, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, kit fox and ringtail. Fish and Wildlife Service officials insist the wall isn’t that big a deal for animals. But many wildlife experts say that a free range, allowing mating between different groups of animals, is crucial to genetic diversity. In the case of Mr. Goodbar, the border wall is “placing the recovery of an endangered species at risk,” said Myles Traphagen, a biologist with the Wildlands Network. The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups are battling to open up the border wall in “priority” areas identified as important for animals. Robinson questions the value of a barrier to stop immigrants in areas that are largely in the middle of nowhere, like the spot where Mr. Goodbar was thwarted. U.S. agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service, he said, defend wrongheaded Trump policies and often serve the interests of the agricultural industry. The reintroduced Mexican gray wolf population numbered some 186 in Arizona and New Mexico in the last count in 2020 (there were 30 across the border in Mexico). This year, the tally could be higher, Robinson said. But the species will likely be doomed by inbreeding without more genetic diversity, which requires large swaths of unimpeded range for the animals to branch out. “These wolves are beautiful, intelligent, social animals that we should want to save just because of empathy,” Robinson told HuffPost. “And because we played a role in their decimation, we have an obligation to help them.” Wolves play a crucial role at the “center of the ecological system,” Robinson added. They cull prey animals that are injured, weakened or sick, and they keep larger animals like elk moving so they don’t wipe out large areas of vegetation that other species depend on. Wolves also leave food behind to be scavenged by species like rare wolverines. But “time is running out” to save the wolves, Robinson warned. “President Biden should knock down the wall,” he said. “Allowing Mexican gray wolves to roam freely would do right by the sublime Chihuahuan Desert and its sky-island mountains. We can’t allow [the wall], this stark monument to stupidity, to slowly strangle a vast ecosystem.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,5 Easy-To-Use Composters That'll Help You Reduce Food Waste,environment," Shopping Writer for HuffPost Starting this year, homes and business across the state of California will need to rethink the concept of food waste and the impact excess scraps have on the environment. In an effort to reduce the amount of materials going into landfills, a new California policy, which will take full effect by 2024, will require residents to collect their food scraps together along with their yard trimmings and place them into curbside collection bins used for composting. Robert Reed works with Recology, the San Francisco based waste management company responsible for heading California’s composting efforts. He told HuffPost the policy is an important step in sustainability and preservation because composting is equally and possible more beneficial than traditional recycling in our efforts to help protect the environment. ″[It] saves landfill space and reduces greenhouse gases,” he added. In fact, “landfills are responsible for 12% of the global methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 34% more potent than CO2,” according to Seema Prabhu, program director of Trash Hero, an organization aimed at achieving a zero-waste future, Reed also noted composting has a direct effect in preserving precious top soils needed for water conservation, growing vegetation, protecting vital bee populations and even reducing wild fire risk. It’s not just California taking note of the benefits of composting. According to Reed, states like Vermont have already implemented similar measures along with over 150 cities and dozens of universities. You don’t have to give away your food scraps in municipals bins, however. With the help of at-home composting systems, you can give new life to all organic matter, from discarded banana peels to used coffee grounds, eggshells and apple cores. Using either electrical, outdoor or vermicomposting methods, you can break down food scraps into usable matter in the form of liquid (compost tea or bokashi, a Japanese term for fermented organic matter) and dry substances in order to create nutrient-rich fertilizer ideal for personal plants or community green spaces. Electrical indoor composters use heat and grinding elements to rapidly break down scraps, while vermicomposting utilizes worms to decompose vegetation, creating a byproduct called worm castings that makes a healthy soil additive filled with diverse microorganisms. Outdoor methods usually involve a vessel that traps heat to break down food scraps without the need for worms, however, both vermicomposting and outdoor non-electric composting can take up to six months to create a fertilizer. Even if you’re a city dweller with little access to green spaces, Prabhu said, at-home composting systems can still be a viable and easy option. “If you have a balcony, you can also grow your own veggies or herbs in a mix of compost, diluted bokashi and soil, which is not only satisfying but a great way to reduce the distance between your food and your table,” Prabhu said. The impact of composting goes much further when it comes to eliminating global waste as a whole. “We often see that once people start separating their trash, they become more aware of their consumption habits. It becomes obvious to them how much they are throwing away, both food and other items like packaging, and they naturally begin to develop habits to reduce this amount ― the ultimate goal,” Prabhu said. Whether you want start collecting your food scraps or create nutritious soil for your community garden, there are accessible means of composting that work for every budget and location. Read the list below to see a few main at-home composting systems as well what you will need to do in order to maintain them. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

2,Trump EPA Chief's Bid For Top Virginia Environmental Post Likely Doomed,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Democratic state senators in Virginia are signaling that they have the votes to block Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump’s controversial second head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former coal lobbyist, from becoming the state’s top environmental official. Newly sworn-in Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) announced earlier this month that he had picked Wheeler for secretary of natural resources, a choice that enraged Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups. Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority in the Virginia Senate, meaning a party-line vote would sink Wheeler’s nomination. If a single Democrat supports Wheeler, however, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, would cast the tiebreaking vote. State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D) is chair of the committee that considers gubernatorial nominees and submits resolutions confirming their appointment. In a statement late last week, he noted that he expects Wheeler’s nomination to be rejected. “I think the Democratic caucus is pretty united,” Deeds told HuffPost on Monday. Along with fielding phone calls from concerned constituents, Deeds said he and his colleagues read with interest a detailed letter from more than 150 former EPA employees sent earlier this month. In it, the group detailed much of Wheeler’s record at the agency and accused him of having “pursued an extremist approach, methodically weakening EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment, instead favoring polluters.” “They provided a lot of information that I don’t know how you can rebut,” Deeds said. “Now, Wheeler tells me he can rebut it, that it’s not true. I assume he’s talking to the various Democratic members, that’s what I suggested to do. Everybody is an independent thinker.” Deeds and Wheeler spoke by phone shortly after his nomination and the two later met in Deeds’ office, the state senator said. On both occasions, Deeds told the former Trump official that he expected Democrats to vote down his nomination, he said. “I believe in working with the governor and working with the House where we can,” Deeds said. “Where we can’t, we’re going to stand firm on our ground. We’re not planning on going back on anything, and this nomination would be a step back.” Several other Democratic state senators, including some of the caucus’ more moderate members, have voiced concern about Wheeler or outright opposition to him. And like Deeds, some have expressed confidence that they will succeed in defeating the nomination. “We do,” state Sen. Joe Morrissey (D) told The Hill when asked if his party had enough votes to block Wheeler. In Virginia, governors’ cabinet picks typically sail through confirmation. The last time the Virginia General Assembly blocked a nomination was in 2006, when Republicans rejected Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine’s nomination of Daniel LeBlanc to serve as secretary of the commonwealth, as The New York Times reported. Wheeler ― fresh off his tenure in the Trump administration, where he played a key role in rolling back various climate and environmental rules ― has proven to be a particularly contentious choice for a powerful state environmental position. As HuffPost first reported last week, numerous current EPA staffers have come out forcefully against their old boss. Marie Owens Powell, president of the AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, wrote that Wheeler “destroyed or weakened dozens of environmental safeguards at EPA, with the sole intention of bolstering polluting industries’ profit margins.” “We believe he will do so again if you confirm his nomination,” Owens Powell wrote to Virginia state senators. Youngkin’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Last week, the governor’s office referred HuffPost to a previous interview Youngkin did with WTVR-TV in Richmond, in which he called Wheeler “the most qualified person for this job.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Experts Have 'Fingers Crossed' For Survival Of Rare Elephant Twins,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Wildlife experts are cautiously hopeful following the birth of elephant twins at a reserve in Kenya. The two babies, a male and female, were born this week at Samburu National Reserve to a mother named Bora, the nonprofit Save the Elephants announced. The charity’s elephant researchers work within the park and it also trains guides to help monitor the animals. “Twins are rarely encountered in elephant populations — and form around only 1% of births,” zoologist and Save the Elephants founder Iain Douglas-Hamilton said in a statement. “Quite often the mothers don’t have enough milk to support two calves.” The quality of vegetation available for the mother elephant to eat, as well as the mother’s experience, are both big factors in the potential survival of a pair of twins, according to an Instagram post from the nonprofit. In this case, Bora has successfully already raised one calf that was born in 2017. Researchers with the charity plan to pay close attention to the elephant family and monitor the young elephants’ health. “The next few days will be touch and go for the new twins but we all have our fingers crossed for their survival,” Douglas-Hamilton said. African elephants are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with the biggest threats being poaching and habitat loss. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Whether or not you’ve ever had that oddly specific dream, you can now get a sneak peek into the penguin experience via “penguin cam:” footage from a special camera that researchers temporarily fitted on a foraging gentoo penguin in Argentina’s Beagle Channel. WOW! Penguin takes astounding selfie video while it dives and feeds #penguinawarnessday @wcsargentina @CadicUshuaia https://t.co/nIqgs2UXBE pic.twitter.com/lp2aGFGXOk “We attached the device just for one foraging trip, and upon the penguin’s return we unattached the device and monitored the breeding success of the nest,” Andrea Raya Rey, associate researcher at Wildlife Conservation Society Argentina, said in a news release. “The Gentoo continued with its parental duties and taking care of the offspring.” The resulting video provides a penguin’s-eye-view of swimming straight into a large and presumably delicious school of sardines. Gentoo penguins more typically hunt near the seafloor for creatures that include squid and crustaceans, ScienceAlert noted. But the video serves as evidence that they’ll also go for small fish swimming closer to the surface (like sardines) if the opportunity presents itself. “We wrote in many papers that the seabird community in the Beagle Channel rely on sardines but this is the actual proof, and now it is confirmed and with a star behind the camera: the penguin,” said Raya Rey.

15,EPA Union Urges Virginia Lawmakers To Reject Trump’s Former EPA Chief,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost Federal employees at the Environmental Protection Agency are fighting to keep Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump’s controversial second head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former coal lobbyist, from becoming Virginia’s top environmental official. Earlier this month, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) announced Wheeler as his pick to serve as secretary of natural resources. The choice outraged state Democrats and environmental groups, who described Wheeler as “the absolute worst pick” for the post. ​​AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, has joined the effort to block Wheeler’s nomination. In a letter to Virginia state senators on Thursday, Marie Owens Powell, the union’s president and a longtime EPA employee, wrote that Wheeler “destroyed or weakened dozens of environmental safeguards at EPA, with the sole intention of bolstering polluting industries’ profit margins.” They warned that Virginia could expect the same of him. “There are few who understand more acutely the threat Mr. Wheeler poses to [the Virginia Department of Natural and Historic Resources] and the natural environment that Virginians cherish than those of us who saw first-hand the impact of Mr. Wheeler’s misguided leadership at the EPA,” the letter reads. Public backlash to Youngkin’s nominee sets the stage for what is likely to be a contentious confirmation process. Democrats maintain a 21-19 majority in Virginia’s state Senate. As The Hill reported, two key moderate Democrats have signaled that they are unlikely to support Wheeler for the job. Wheeler served as the EPA’s deputy administrator before taking over for his scandal-plagued predecessor, Scott Pruitt, in 2019. Wheeler helped spearhead the Trump administration’s industry-friendly agenda, dismantling numerous pollution rules and other clean air and water safeguards to the benefit of the extractive industries that he once represented as a lobbyist. Along the way, he repeatedly downplayed the threat of global climate change and sidelined scientific advisory committees. Owens Powell, who has been with the EPA for nearly three decades and works as an underground storage tank inspector in its Philadelphia office, said the work environment at the federal agency during Wheeler’s tenure was “extremely hostile.” “The simple rejection of scientific principles was just so demoralizing to our staff,” she said. “It’s mind-boggling how I have to see him again, at my back door this time.” During Wheeler’s tenure, the EPA scrubbed climate change language from the agency’s website. And Wheeler questioned the results of a sobering federal climate assessment, saying some of its findings were “based on the worst-case scenario.” Owens Powell was surprised that Youngkin tapped Wheeler for the job given what she felt was a clear and well-documented record at the EPA. If he’s confirmed, she fears he will not only cause similar damage in Virginia, but negatively impact the EPA’s ability to collaborate with the state agency, ultimately making it more difficult to confront climate change and other environmental threats. “I couldn’t imagine that anyone would have thought he would be a good idea for this position,” she told HuffPost by phone. “It’s ​​AFGE Council 238’s sincere hope that someone in a position of authority will stand up for sound science and the enforcement of corresponding environmental laws and reject this nomination.” Youngkin’s office did not respond to specific questions Thursday, instead referring HuffPost to an interview the governor did with WTVR-TV in Richmond last week in which he called Wheeler “the most qualified person for this job.” A former private equity executive, Youngkin is the first Republican governor of Virginia since 2009. One of his first actions after being sworn in Jan. 15 was to sign an executive order aimed at withdrawing Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a program that several states joined to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. It’s a move that Wheeler, who defended Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris climate agreement, would no doubt approve of, and one Owens Powell suspects Wheeler’s fingerprints are on. Wheeler was a member of Youngkin’s transition team. The EPA union’s letter comes less than a week after more than 150 former EPA staffers urged Virginia state lawmakers to vote down Wheeler’s nomination. In their own letter, the group said the Trump official “sidelined science” at the EPA and “pursued an extremist approach, methodically weakening EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment, instead favoring polluters.” Sharon Bethune is a Virginia resident, longtime former EPA employee and past vice president for civil rights at AFGE Local 3331. She shares her former colleagues’ concerns. She told HuffPost that during Trump’s term, morale at the EPA was shot, and the “destruction” Wheeler caused factored into her decision to retire in 2019 after nearly four decades at the agency. “It’s mind-boggling how I have to see him again, at my back door this time,” Bethune said. “Right here at my back door.” “I’m thinking about the fact that my grandchildren may not be able to benefit from some of the things I benefit from, all because we put the wrong man in office.” Read the letter below.

0,"Rare, Pristine Rose-Shaped Corals Found In Reef Off Tahiti Coast",environment," Deep in the South Pacific, scientists have explored a rare stretch of pristine corals shaped like roses off the coast of Tahiti. The reef is thought to be one of the largest found at such depths and seems untouched by climate change or human activities. Laetitia Hédouin said she first saw the corals during a recreational dive with a local diving club months earlier. “When I went there for the first time, I thought, ’Wow — we need to study that reef. There’s something special about that reef,” said Hédouin, a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Moorea, French Polynesia. What struck Hédouin was that the corals looked healthy and weren’t affected by a bleaching event in 2019. Corals are tiny animals that grow and form reefs in oceans around the world. Globally, coral reefs have been depleted from overfishing and pollution. Climate change is also harming delicate corals — including those in areas neighboring the newly discovered reef — with severe bleaching caused by warmer waters. Between 2009 and 2018, 14% of the world’s corals were killed, according to a 2020 report by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Project. The newfound reef, stretching 2 miles (3 kilometers), was studied late last year during a dive expedition supported by UNESCO. Unlike most of the world’s mapped corals, which are found in relatively shallow waters, this one was deeper — between 115 feet (35 meters) to 230 feet (70 meters). Exploring such depths posed a challenge: the deeper a diver goes underwater, the shorter amount of time can be safely spent at each depth. The team was equipped with special tanks and did 200 hours of diving to study the reef, including taking photographs, measurements and samples of the coral. The reef is in a spot where many researchers haven’t spent a lot of time in, said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer Mark Eakin. “We’ll be seeing more of these discoveries as the technology is applied to these locations,” said Eakin. “We may find some bigger ones somewhere, but I think this is always going to be an unusual reef.” The recent volcanic eruption in Tonga that triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific has not affected the reef off Tahiti, said Hédouin. Hédouin hopes the research can help experts understand how the reef has been resilient to climate change and human pressures, and what role these deeper corals might play in the ocean ecosystem. More dives are planned in the coming months. “We know very little about the ocean, and there’s still so much that needs to be recorded, needs to be measured,” said Julian Barbière, the head of UNESCO’s marine policy and regional coordination. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

1,Orangutans At New Orleans Zoo Fascinated By Bottle-Fed Baby,environment," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The endangered Sumatran orangutan infant at New Orleans’ zoo is being bottle-fed because his mother wasn’t producing enough milk. The still unnamed baby was being tube-fed as well, but the tube was removed Jan. 13, Audubon Zoo spokeswoman Annie Kinler Matherne said Wednesday. The great apes named for their long red hair are considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Threats to the Sumatran species include hunting and the destruction of the forests and peat swamps where they spend nearly all their time in trees. Twelve-year-old Menari gave birth to the baby on Christmas Eve; a twin brother was stillborn. Days later, the baby was showing signs of weakness and lack of nursing. Veterinarians examined Menari, a first-time mother, and discovered the lactation problem. Since then the infant has had round-the-clock care from zoo staffers wearing furry vests that the baby can cling to. Until the feeding tube was removed, their duties included making sure he didn’t pick or pull at the thin tube inserted through his nose. He’s been eating well and now weighs 1.98 kilograms (4.35 pounds), Audubon Nature Institute Vice President and general curator Bob Lessnau said in a statement sent by Matherne. Since Jan. 8, six to seven hours a day has been spent in front of the other orangutans so they can get to know him, Lessnau said. “Care staff have noticed that the group is most intrigued when there is a diaper change or a bottle feed happening!” a Jan. 13 update said. Bulan, at age 2 the oldest of father Jambi’s three New Orleans offspring, “is especially interested in the new little guy,” the statement said. Madu, the second, was born in February 2021. Experts from Children’s Hospital of New Orleans have helped out, including a speech pathologist brought in to suggest ways to stimulate the baby’s suckling, Lessnau said. Menari is getting a drug that can help maintain lactation, said Bob MacLean, the zoo’s senior veterinarian. “We don’t know if she will maintain or restart lactation if we have a successful reintroduction of the infant to her,” he said Wednesday. But there’s hope in Menari’s history: She also was hand-raised. “Her mother, Feliz, did start lactating for Menari when she was finally successfully reintroduced to her and started suckling at around 8 months of age,” MacLean said in a statement. A recent video shows Dr. Daniel Cutler, the zoo’s associate veterinarian, gently pulling the baby’s hands from hospital keeper Amy Jones’ fur vest, saying, “He’s ... probably not going to like it — he wants to be nice and close and cuddle.” The baby clung to Cutler’s index fingers as it was raised into the air. Looking around, he pulled himself up until the top of his head was almost even with the fingers he gripped. “He’s starting to say, ‘I don’t like where I’m at ... put me back down.’ Which is exactly what we want him to do,” the veterinarian said."
2,5 Products That Will Make Cleaning Your Menstrual Cup Or Disc Way Easier,environment," Shopping Writer for HuffPost Sustainability efforts have made their way into many aspects of the modern lifestyle, including that less-than-enjoyable biological function, menstruation. Global Citizen, a collective action organization aimed at reducing world poverty, reported that single-use menstrual products are responsible for more than 200,000 tons of metric waste annually. Conversely, a recent study conducted by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that people who have periods heavily lean toward switching to reusable period products like menstrual cups, discs and period panties rather than using pads and tampons. Jasmine Pedroso, a board-certified OB-GYN at Kindbody fertility clinic in San Francisco, told HuffPost that she thinks the reason for this shift is largely attributed to the fact that there are more brand and sizing options among reusable products than ever before. Additionally, younger generations are more eco-conscious and people are becoming aware of how cost-effective reusable period products are compared to single-use options (one menstrual cup, for example, can last up to six years). This also means that caring for these long-term use products has become part of the conversation. Pedroso said there are potential risks associated with incorrectly disinfecting and storing reusable menstrual products, which are often made of body-safe yet porous silicones. ″Washing the cup or disc with harsh chemicals may break down or degrade the material it’s made of, rendering it less effective, and furthermore may irritate and change the acidity of the vagina in ways that may increase your risk of getting a vaginal bacterial or yeast infection,” she said. Instead, many people sanitize their cups or discs by boiling them in a pot of water for about five to 10 minutes. However, this can lead to scorched outcomes when boiling cups are accidentally left unattended for too long. “Steamers and sanitizers made specifically for reusable menstrual cups or discs can make the sanitizing process easier, but they are not 100% necessary,” Pedroso said. Automated steamers and sanitizers are a “set it and forget it” option. They work by holding a small amount of water in the basin, then generating a high temperature steam to disinfect period products without affecting the integrity of silicone. There are also ultraviolet light versions available on the market. “At the completion of each cycle and after sanitization, it is usually recommended that you store [the cup or disc] in a secure, clean, dry place until your next cycle,” Pedroso added. This is another added benefit of automated sanitizers, as many of them double as a clean storage place for cups and discs. If you want a way to effectively care for, disinfect and store your reusable period products, check out the list of sanitizers below.

3,Watch Warthogs Run For Their Lives As Leopard Attacks,environment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Warthogs in South Africa spotted a leopard almost too late as the big cat ambushed them. (Watch the video below.) But the warthogs accelerated and darted to discourage the leopard just seconds into the chase at Kruger National Park. Commenters on Latest Sightings’ YouTube video, shared Tuesday, noted how surprisingly quick the warthogs are. The outcome was no surprise to Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of Latest Sightings, which shares wildlife footage. “Eighty percent of hunts are failures,” he told HuffPost. “Prey animals are very fast, but they also have stamina.” Indeed, a leopard’s top speed is 36 miles an hour, according to Untamed Animals, while warthogs can sprint to about 30 miles an hour. But a warthog can reach maximum velocity swiftly and has much more endurance, AfricaFreak noted. The leopard dashed at a piglet initially, but the predators are wary of adult warthogs because of their tusks, “which can easily kill a leopard,” Ossendryver said. “I’ve seen that myself.” In this pursuit, score one for the warthogs. “Sightings like this are what makes it all worth it!” Jan-Louis Human, who shot the footage with photographic guide Moosa Varachia, told Latest Sightings.

4,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,environment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

6,Stephen Colbert Flags Hilarious Text That 'Jumped Out' From Jan. 6 Hearing,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert noticed a text during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing that seemed like an awfully casual way to start a chat about an attempted coup. The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack presented evidence that showed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wanted to hand-deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence aide Chris Hodgson wrote “Sup?” to Johnson staffer Sean Riley just after noon on Jan. 6 with Riley responding that he needed to “hand something to VPOTUS.” When asked what it was, Riley said it was alternate slates of electors for Wisconsin and Michigan. “But what jumped out to me when I saw it this afternoon was that the treasonous text chain started simply with ‘Sup?’” Colbert said. “Sup? Pretty chill way to overthrow democracy. ‘Sup?’ ‘OMG Let’s totes seat altern8 electors for the lolz!’” Pence’s office ultimately refused to comply with the demands of former President Donald Trump and his allies to help them overturn the election, and a mob went on to besiege Congress in an effort to stop the certification of the results, with some of its members chanting for Pence to be hung.

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,environment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,"‘Explorer’ Eagle Finds A Home In Coastal Maine, Far From Its Native Asia",environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost BOOTHBAY HARBOR, Maine — Winter is typically a sleepy time for this small seaside town nestled on a peninsula about an hour northeast of Portland. With no tourists, many businesses shut down entirely for the season. But visitors have flocked here in recent weeks, braving frigid temperatures for a chance to glimpse Boothbay’s newest resident: a rare bird of prey that has no earthly business in this part of the world. The Steller’s sea eagle, a giant raptor native to parts of Asia and Siberia, has been bouncing around Maine’s midcoast since Dec. 30 — its latest stop on an epic journey across North America. While the species occasionally turns up in western Alaska, this is the first time one has been documented in the Lower 48. “I would say that this is the most exciting rare bird that’s ever been in the United States,” Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, told HuffPost. Several factors brought Lund to that conclusion. “Its rarity — there are only 4,000 of them in the entire world,” he said. “Its physical impressiveness. It’s the largest eagle in the world, it’s huge, it’s identifiable. And the fact that it is so far from its home.” The stunning bird, which author Thomas Hynes aptly described as a “muppet,” has a large, cartoonish yellow-orange beak and distinctive white plumage along its upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball. Steller’s sea eagles are significantly larger than bald eagles, with a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, and weigh up to 20 pounds. For whatever reason, the bird seems to have taken a liking to Boothbay, frequenting a number of sites along the water. It is unclear whether it is a male or female. The scene on Sunday felt like a sporting event. That morning, the bird had been spotted near a seasonal inn at Spruce Point, south of town. The sighting was reported on a 1,700-member GroupMe account created to track and discuss the wayward bird. The news traveled fast. By the time HuffPost made it to Spruce Point at 11:30 a.m., the parking lot and road were lined with cars from Maine, Connecticut and New York. But the bird, perhaps startled by the growing crowd, had been flushed from its perch and headed west, toward Mouse Island. Dozens of bird enthusiasts gathered in small groups along the two-lane road, binoculars and spotting scopes aimed across the harbor. Someone thought they’d found it but was disappointed when it was merely a mundane bald eagle. Then one woman, who’d been viewing the bird from a different vantage point, described its location for other anxious birders. “Oh, my God!” another woman shouted after catching a glimpse. “I want to give you a big hug,” she told the woman who’d helped point it out. There, on the north end of the island, the eagle’s white wing bars popped against a backdrop of evergreen branches. Every once in a while, it flashed its brightly colored beak. Louis DeMarco, of Brooklyn, New York, was dropping off a kayak for repair in the town of Bath when a friend and fellow birder told him he wasn’t far from the famous bird. Instead of heading home to New York, DeMarco detoured 45 minutes to Boothbay. The decision didn’t disappoint. “Holy moly! HOLY MOLY!” DeMarco said repeatedly after someone let him use this scope to view the eagle from across the harbor. “These are distant views. I think what they usually say is, ‘Better view desired,’” he said, referencing a saying among birders for when you see a bird but wish you’d been closer. “I didn’t think I had any chance of it, so I’ll take a ‘better view desired.’” pic.twitter.com/Yu4GNI1avf This Steller’s sea eagle first surprised the birding world when it turned up along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020. Since then it has continued a slow journey east, popping up in Texas, eastern Canada and now New England. Before arriving in Maine late last month, it spent a week or so mingling with bald eagles along the Taunton River in southeastern Massachusetts. Many have understandably taken to describing the animal as “lost,” but experts say all indications are that it is healthy and content in its travels. “This eagle is right at home,” Lund said. “It’s on a different continent, but it is in a place that is very much like its native range. I choose to sort of celebrate it as an explorer, as someone living its best life and going out on its own and making its way in the world.” Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is not uncommon. Some do get lost or are blown off course in inclement weather, typically during migration. And raptors, particularly younger ones, have been known to venture out in search of new territory. Lund noted that sightings of rare and vagrant birds tend to spark everything from joy and excitement to concern. Laurie Ireland, a lifelong birder and resident of Belfast, Maine, said she found herself in tears thinking about how the eagle might not survive or make it back home. Of all the birds Ireland has observed over the years, the Steller’s ranks high on her list. “I would never get to Russia,” she said. “Never.” A few years ago, a great black hawk, a tropical species native to Central and South America, turned up in Maine and later had to be euthanized after suffering frostbite on its legs. The birding community mourned the loss. Unlike the black hawk, which wasn’t built to survive Maine winters, the Steller’s sea eagle appears to be thriving here, Lund said. As for how long it will stick around Boothbay, it’s anyone’s guess. “Getting into the spring will be very interesting, because that’s when these birds look for mates and territories,” Lund said. He noted it could possibly settle down and even breed with a bald eagle. (An apparent hybrid of the two eagle species was seen on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, in 2004.) “Everyone’s sort of waiting to see what might happen,” Lund said.

11,"Tonga Volcano Relief Complicated By Communications Cutoff, Virus Fears",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Tonga is reeling after a devastating volcanic eruption that caused a tsunami and left the island nation shrouded in ash and without internet service to coordinate urgent clean-up and relief operations. The Tongan government said Tuesday at least three people were confirmed dead after the eruption on Saturday and that some islands were heavily damaged by tsunami waves that neared 50 feet. Every home on one outer island with a few dozen residents was destroyed, and only two houses remained on another, home to about 100 people, officials added. There were few updates on the eruption until now because an undersea cable was severed in the eruption, cutting off the internet and many domestic phone calls, the government said. Officials were only able to reach outlying islands hit hard by the tsunami on Monday using satellite phones. The huge eruption — estimated by NASA to be about 10 megatons — didn’t appear to cause the widespread devastation feared in some heavily populated areas. Officials are primarily worried about heavy levels of ash that have fallen over many islands and the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people remain unaccounted for after the eruption due to the limited communications networks. Tonga has, so far, largely escaped the coronavirus surge that has affected nearly every other nation on the planet: The country has reported just one case and zero deaths from the disease, and all incoming travelers are required to quarantine for 21 days to prevent any new infections. Jonathan Veitch, a United Nations coordinator for the region based in Fiji, said aid workers were urgently working to determine how to deliver needed supplies to Tonga while minimizing any threat from the coronavirus. Australia and New Zealand, some of the country’s nearest neighbors, have loaded up supply planes, but the Tongan airport is unusable due to ash. Aerial images released this week show homes and buildings blanketed in gray drifts. Ships carrying equipment and relief supplies to help clear the runway are en route, but they are still days away, and it’s unclear how they plan to deliver any supplies without making direct contact. Veitch said he was deeply concerned about the availability of water across the nation’s islands, which rely mainly on rain for drinking needs. Volcanic ash has spoiled those water supplies. “The biggest thing that I’m concerned about is water,” Veitch told the BBC this week. “The vast majority of Tongans rely on rainwater for their supply and they can’t use it right now because it’s contaminated. … Any rainwater is acidic.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,Volcanic Ash Delays Aid Deliveries To Tonga As Scale Of Damage Emerges,environment," WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Thick ash on an airport runway was delaying aid deliveries to the Pacific island nation of Tonga, where significant damage was being reported days after a huge undersea volcanic eruption and tsunami. New Zealand’s military is sending much-needed drinking water and other supplies, but said the ash on the runway will delay the flight at least a day. A towering ash cloud since Saturday’s eruption had prevented earlier flights. New Zealand also sent a navy ship to Tonga Tuesday with another planned to leave later in the day and pledged an initial 1 million New Zealand dollars ($680,000) toward recovery efforts. Australia sent a navy ship from Sydney to Brisbane to prepare for a support mission if needed. Communications with Tonga have been extremely limited, but New Zealand and Australia sent military surveillance flights to assess the damage on Monday, with aerial photos showing the vibrant Tongan landscape transformed by the ash into a gray moonscape. U.N. humanitarian officials and Tonga’s government “report significant infrastructural damage around Tongatapu,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. “There has been no contact from the Ha’apai Group of islands, and we are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands — Mango and Fonoi — following surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,” Dujarric said. New Zealand’s High Commission in Tonga also reported “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, including to resorts and along the waterfront area. The commission said Tonga police had confirmed two deaths from the tsunami, including one who was a British national. Satellite images captured the spectacular eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a giant mushroom above the South Pacific. Tsunami waves of about 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) crashed into Tonga’s shoreline, and crossed the Pacific, causing minor damage from New Zealand to Santa Cruz, California. The eruption set off a sonic boom that could be heard as far away as Alaska. Two people drowned in Peru, which also reported an oil spill after waves moved a ship that was transferring oil at a refinery. Family said British woman Angela Glover, 50, died after being swept away by a wave in Tonga. Nick Eleini said his sister’s body had been found and that her husband survived. “I understand that this terrible accident came about as they tried to rescue their dogs,” Eleini told Sky News. He said it had been his sister’s life dream” to live in the South Pacific and “she loved her life there.” The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of Nuku’alofa, was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions. In late 2014 and early 2015, eruptions created a small new island and disrupted air travel to the Pacific archipelago. Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island after a new vent began erupting in late December. Satellite images showed how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga. The U.N. World Food Program is exploring how to bring in relief supplies and more staff and has received a request to restore communication lines in Tonga, Dujarric said. One complicating factor is that Tonga has managed to avoid outbreaks of COVID-19. New Zealand said its military staff were vaccinated and willing to follow Tonga’s protocols. New Zealand’s military said it hoped the airfield in Tonga would be opened either Wednesday or Thursday. The military said it had considered an airdrop but that was “not the preference of the Tongan authorities.” Communications with the island nation is limited because the single underwater fiber-optic cable that connects Tonga to the rest of the world was likely severed in the eruption. The company that owns the cable and repairs could take weeks. Samiuela Fonua, who chairs the board at Tonga Cable Ltd., said the cable appeared to have been severed about 10 to 15 minutes after the eruption. He said the cable lies atop and within coral reef, which can be sharp. Fonua said a ship would need to pull up the cable to assess the damage and then crews would need to fix it. A single break might take a week to repair, he said, while multiple breaks could take up to three weeks. He added that it was unclear yet when it would be safe for a ship to venture near the undersea volcano to undertake the work. A second undersea cable that connects the islands within Tonga also appeared to have been severed, Fonua said. However, a local phone network was working, allowing Tongans to call each other. But he said the lingering ash cloud was continuing to make even satellite phone calls abroad difficult. ___ Associated Press journalist Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report."
13,"Snow, Ice Blasts Through South With Powerful Winter Storm",environment," ATLANTA (AP) — A dangerous winter storm combining high winds and ice swept through parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, knocking out power, felling trees and fences and coating roads with a treacherous frigid glaze. Tens of thousands of customers were without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. More than an inch of snow fell per hour in some parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, according to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center. The storm was making air travel extremely difficult in some parts of the South. The nation’s hardest-hit airport ― Charlotte Douglas International ― remained open around dawn Sunday, the airport said in a weather briefing. But more than 1,000 Sunday flights in Charlotte have been cancelled – more than 80% of the airport’s Sunday schedule, according to the flight tracking service flightaware.com. Charlotte is a major hub in the South for American Airlines. In Atlanta, where Delta Air Lines operates it main hub, more than 300 Sunday flights have been canceled. Conditions were expected to continue to deteriorate later Sunday, and possible ground stops were possible at airports in the Washington, D.C. area, the Federal Aviation Administration said in its air traffic control plan for Sunday. Parts of North Carolina were under a winter storm warning until Monday morning. Raleigh was experiencing a mix of frozen precipitation. Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said to expect a “significant ice storm across portions of the central Carolinas,” including the Charlotte metropolitan area. In the Asheville area, local television footage showed snow accumulation covering the streets with white. Buncombe County closed all parks, libraries and solid waste facilities through Monday. In Boone to the northeast, Appalachian State University suspended many operations on Sunday and told all but certain essential workers to remain away from campus until at least Monday morning. By early Sunday, more than 100,000 customers were without power in Georgia but the vast majority of them were northeast of the metro Atlanta area, in the northeast Georgia mountains, according to poweroutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide. Rabun County, in Georgia’s northeast corner, was hardest hit with more than half the customers there without power. About 50,000 customers were without power in South Carolina; and 11,000 customers in North Carolina had no power. Crews pretreated roadways in Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia but officials still urged people to stay off them unless travel was necessary. The Tennessee Highway Patrol said in a tweet that some roads in East Tennessee were snow-covered and that troopers were working several accidents due to ice. In Greenville, South Carolina, an out-of-the-ordinary snowfall coated roads before changing to ice. Much of the state was under a winter storm warning, with winds as high as 40 mph (64 kph). The National Weather Service confirmed that a tornado struck southwest Florida, with local media reporting some damage of unknown severity. The Florida Highway Patrol reported that a large tornado crossed Interstate 75 near Naples, causing a semi-truck to overturn. Minor injuries were reported. Florida Power and Light reported that about 16,000 customers in southwest Florida were without power. Lee County firefighters told WINK-TV that 20 homes were destroyed at the Tropicana Mobile Home Resort and one person was injured. After lashing the South, weather forecasters say the Northeast can expect similar conditions. While New York City was expected to be spared from most, if not all, of the snowfall from the winter storm, coastal areas on Long Island and Connecticut were expecting high winds and gale conditions, and upstate New York was projected to get hit with up to a foot of snow to go along with high winds. The National Weather Service forecast winds of up to 60 mph across Long Island and widespread coastal flooding there and in Connecticut by Monday morning. In upstate New York, temperatures in the single digits were projected to rise into the 20s and bring heavy snow beginning Sunday night and lasting until Monday night. Six to 12 inches of snow was expected in parts of east-central Ohio and western Pennsylvania from Sunday afternoon, resulting in slick and hazardous road conditions. In parts of eastern Pennsylvania, forecasters expected three to five inches of snow early changing to a wintry mix including sleet and freezing rain or completely rain."
14,A Massive Icefish Breeding Colony Existed In Secret In Antarctica — Until Now,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A polar research exploration has discovered a previously unknown breeding colony of millions of fish in an icy Antarctic sea. Believed to be the world’s largest known fish breeding ground, the expanse of about 60 million Jonah’s icefish nests stretches across 92 square miles of the Weddell Sea floor, according to The New York Times. Icefish have no red blood cells ― which gives them transparent blood ― and skulls that you can see through. Their clear blood also contains a special protein that stops it from freezing. The scientists who made the discovery, researchers from Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute aboard the RV Polarstern, weren’t looking for icefish nests in particular. But when they came across the nest site, they knew they’d found something special. “I’d never seen anything like it in 15 years of being an ocean scientist,” researcher Dr. Autun Purser told CNN. “After that dive, we emailed the experts on shore who know about fish like this. They said, yep, this is pretty unique.” A typical nest had around 1,500 to 2,000 eggs, New Scientist reports. Purser told the publication that it’s unclear how many of those eggs ultimately hatch and survive, and that in general, a lot about icefish is still unknown. Most of the nests were guarded by an adult fish, but in some cases, one fish guarded multiple nests. Still other nests were empty, or contained the carcass of a fish who died at its post. Fish who died in the middle of the nest field tended to just rot in place, while those who died closer to the edges were scavenged by animals like starfish and octopuses. Another animal that enjoys dining on the icefish is the Weddell seal, a plump, carnivorous mammal that can dive up to 2,000 feet into the ocean. The researchers who discovered the icefish nests took a look at satellite tracking data on the seals and found that the nest site is a major destination for Weddell seal dives. “They’re having a nice dinner,” Purser told the Times.

15,"Undersea Volcano Erupts In Pacific, Islanders Rush To Escape Tsunami",environment," WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An undersea volcano erupted in spectacular fashion Saturday near the Pacific nation of Tonga, sending tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground. Tsunami advisories were issued for Hawaii, Alaska and the U.S. Pacific coast. There were no immediate reports of injuries or on the extent of the damage because all internet connectivity with Tonga was lost at about 6:40 p.m. local time, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm Kentik. Tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from Suva, Fiji, which presumably was damaged. Southern Cross Cable Network, the company that manages the connection, does not know yet “if the cable is cut or just suffering power loss,” chief technical officer Dean Veverka said. He said he assumed the eruption was responsible. The Fiji-based Islands Business news site reported that a convoy of police and military troops evacuated King Tupou VI from his palace near the shore. He was among the many residents who headed for higher ground. In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported waves that measured half a meter (1.6 feet) in Nawiliwili, Kauai and 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) in Hanalei. The National Weather Service said there were reports of boats getting pushed up in docks, but the hazard diminished as the morning went on. “We are relieved that there is no reported damage and only minor flooding throughout the islands,” the tsunami center said, describing the situation in Hawaii. The tsunami advisory for the islands was lifted about 11 hours after the eruption more than 4,828 kilometers (3,000 miles) away. On Tonga, home to about 105,000 people, video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas, swirling around homes, a church and other buildings. Satellite images showed a huge eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters. New Zealand’s military said it was monitoring the situation and remained on standby, ready to assist if asked. The Tonga Meteorological Services said a tsunami warning was declared for all of the archipelago, and data from the Pacific tsunami center said waves of 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) were detected. A Twitter user identified as Dr. Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau posted video showing waves crashing ashore. “Can literally hear the volcano eruption, sounds pretty violent,” he wrote, adding in a later post: “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.” The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions. Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent there began erupting in late December. Satellite images captured by the company show how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga. “The surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45% due to ashfall,” Planet Labs said days before the latest activity. Following Saturday’s eruption, residents in Hawaii, Alaska and along the U.S. Pacific coast were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground and to pay attention to specific instructions from their local emergency management officials, said Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska. “We don’t issue an advisory for this length of coastline as we’ve done - I’m not sure when the last time was - but it really isn’t an everyday experience,” Snider said. He said the waves slamming ashore in Hawaii were just under the criteria for a more serious tsunami warning. “It looks like everything will stay below the warning level, but it’s difficult to predict because this is a volcanic eruption, and we’re set up to measure earthquake or seismic-driven sea waves,” Snider said. The first waves to hit the continental United States measured about 33 centimeters 1 foot in Nikolski, Alaska and 59 centimeters (1.9 feet) in Adak, Alaska. A wave of about 79 centimeters (2.6 feet) was observed in Monterey, California, according to the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center. Beaches and piers were closed across Southern California as a precaution. The National Weather Service tweeted there were “no significant concerns about inundation.” Strong rip currents were possible, however, and officials warned people to stay out of the water. On California’s central coast, the National Weather Service reported tsunami waves up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) and flooding in beach parking lots at Port San Luis. About 200 miles (320 km) down the coast, the waves were much smaller at Southern California’s Seal Beach, according to Michael Pless, the owner of M&M Surf School. “The waves are looking pretty flat,” Pless said. “We’re hoping they reopen the beach in a couple hours.” Crowds gathered at the Santa Cruz Harbor in California to watch the rising and falling water strain boat ties on docks. Law enforcement tried to clear people away when big surges started at around 7:30 a.m. About an hour later, a surge went over the back lip of the harbor, filling a parking lot and low-lying streets and setting some cars afloat. In 2011 after the Japanese earthquake a series of surges cost $20 million of damage in the harbor.

Residents of American Samoa were alerted of a tsunami warning by local broadcasters as well as church bells that rang territory-wide Saturday. An outdoor siren warning system was out of service. Those living along the shoreline quickly moved to higher ground. As night fell, there were no reports of any damage and the Hawaii-based tsunami center canceled the alert. Authorities in the nearby island nations of Fiji and Samoa also issued warnings, telling people to avoid the shoreline due to strong currents and dangerous waves. In New Zealand, officials warned of possible storm surges from the eruption. New Zealand’s private forecaster, Weather Watch, tweeted that people as far away as Southland, the country’s southernmost region, reported hearing sonic booms from the eruption. Others reported that many boats were damaged by a tsunami that hit a marina in Whangarei, in the Northland region. Earlier, the Matangi Tonga news site reported that scientists observed massive explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early Friday. Satellite images showed a 5-kilometer (3- mile) -wide plume rising into the air to about 20 kilometers (12 miles). The Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano is located about 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital, Nuku’alofa. In late 2014 and early 2015, a series of eruptions in the area created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days. There is not a significant difference between volcanoes underwater and on land, and underwater volcanoes become bigger as they erupt, at some point usually breaching the surface, said Hans Schwaiger, a research geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. With underwater volcanoes, however, the water can add to the explosivity of the eruption as it hits the lava, Schwaiger added. Before an explosion, there is generally an increase in small local earthquakes at the volcano, but depending on how far it is from land, that may not be felt by residents along the shoreline, Schwaiger said. In 2019, Tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when a fiber-optic cable was severed. The director of the local cable company said at the time that a large ship may have cut the cable by dragging an anchor. Until limited satellite access was restored people couldn’t even make international calls. Southern Cross Cable Network’s Veverka said limited satellite connections exist between Tonga and other parts of the world but he did not know if they might be affected by power outages.
