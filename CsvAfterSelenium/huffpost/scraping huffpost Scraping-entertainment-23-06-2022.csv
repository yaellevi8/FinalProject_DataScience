0,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Martin Sheen Says He ‘Regrets’ Not Using His Real Name Professionally,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Martin Sheen may be a household name, but the actor himself wishes you knew him by his real name. Sheen — the son of a Spanish immigrant father and Irish immigrant mother — was born with the name Ramon Estévez. In an interview with Closer Weekly published Monday, the “Apocalypse Now” star said that he wishes he used his actual name when he was starting out as an actor. “That’s one of my regrets,” he told the magazine. “I never changed my name officially. It’s still Ramon Estévez on my birth certificate. It’s on my marriage license, my passport, driver’s license.” He chalked up the decision of being naive when he first started in show business. “Sometimes you get persuaded when you don’t have enough insight or even enough courage to stand up for what you believe in, and you pay for it later,” he said. “But, of course, I’m only speaking for myself.” He added that when his son, Emilio Estévez, first started acting professionally, he advised his son to stay true to his name. “The only influence I had on Emilio was to keep his name,” Sheen told Closer. “When he started out, his agent was advising him to change his name to Sheen and he wouldn’t do it. And I thank God he didn’t.” Sheen’s other famous son, Charlie Sheen, didn’t take the same advice — initially. In 2013, he was credited in Robert Rodriguez‘s film “Machete Kills” by his real name, Carlos Estévez, in the title cards. But in 2017’s “Mad Families,” Charlie Sheen was credited by his professional name. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Brad Pitt Gets Conned Into Hunting For Fake Buried Treasure At His French Mansion,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost In a stunning rebuke of today’s relatable celebrity culture, Brad Pitt revealed he spent a year hunting for buried medieval treasure that never existed beneath his French estate. Yes, for some reason the Oscar winner chose to come clean about getting swindled by an unnamed man who convinced him that the property he once shared with ex-wife Angelina Jolie was even more valuable than the estimated $60 million the former couple forked over for it back in 2008. Speaking with GQ in a profile published on Wednesday, Pitt said he was told that there were “millions of dollars worth of gold” left by the villa’s medieval owners that had been “taken from the Levant during the Crusades and buried on the grounds.” “I got obsessed,” said Pitt, who acquired radar equipment to hunt for the loot. “Like for a year, this was all I could think about, just the excitement of it all. Maybe it has something to do with where I grew up, because in the Ozark Mountains” near his childhood home in Missouri, “there were always stories of hidden caches of gold.” Ultimately, Pitt came up empty, and it was revealed that the man had targeted him as a potential investor in a radar company and (successfully) pitched the prospect of undiscovered riches to dupe the actor. Pitt said the ordeal left him feeling “pretty foolish in the end.” “It was just the hunt that was exciting,” he remarked. Despite the slightly embarrassing admission, there are grounds to believe buried treasure may lay beneath the historic villa. Pitt’s Château Miraval sits along an ancient Roman trade route and contains a sprawling estate and various structures, including the 13th-century chapel where he and Jolie wed. The château and its award-winning wine from the property’s vineyards have since become a major source of contention in the former couple’s ongoing divorce battle. After Jolie sold her stake in the business last year to Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, Pitt sued her in February, claiming she unlawfully disregarded their agreement never to sell their shares without the other’s permission. In a filing from Pitt’s legal team earlier this month, the actor claims Jolie “sought to inflict harm on” him by forcing him to partner with “a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions” who plans to launch a “hostile” takeover of the business. Jolie hasn’t commented on Pitt’s allegations or his hunt for fake treasure. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,"James Rado, Co-Creator Of Groundbreaking Musical ‘Hair,’ Dead At 90",entertainment," NEW YORK (AP) — James Rado, co-creator of the groundbreaking hippie musical “Hair,” which celebrated protest, pot and free love and paved the way for the sound of rock on Broadway, has died. He was 90. Rado died Tuesday night in New York City of cardio respiratory arrest, according to friend and publicist Merle Frimark. “Hair,” which has a story and lyrics by Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot, was the first rock musical on Broadway, the first Broadway show to feature full nudity and the first to feature a same-sex kiss. “Hair” made possible other rock musicals like “Jesus Christ Superstar” and “Rent.” Like “Hamilton,” it was one of only a handful of Broadway shows in the past few decades to find its songs on the pop charts. The so-called “American tribal love-rock musical,” had its world premiere at the Public Theater in New York City’s East Village in 1967 and transferred the following year to Broadway, where the musical ran more than 1,800 performances. Rado played Claude, a young man about to be drafted and sent to the war in Vietnam. Clive Barnes, theater critic for The New York Times, called the show “the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.” The New York Post said it had “unintentional charm,” contagious high spirits and a “young zestfulness” that “make it difficult to resist.” Variety, however, called it “loony.” It lost the Tony in 1969 to the more traditional “1776” but won a Grammy Award. The 2009 revival won the best revival Tony. The show was revived on Broadway in 1977 and again in 2009. It was made into a movie directed by Milos Forman in 1979 starring Treat Williams and Beverly D’Angelo. “Hair” spawned four top four singles on the American pop charts, including the No. 1 hit “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” by the Fifth Dimension, which won the Grammy Award for record of the year and best pop vocal performance by a group in 1970. Others included “Hair” by the Cowsills, “Good Morning, Starshine” by the singer Oliver and “Easy to Be Hard” by Three Dog Night. The cast album itself stayed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks “Hair” tells the story of Claude and Berger, best buddies who find freedom in the late 1960s. Between draft-card burnings, love-ins, bad LSD trips and a parade of protest marches, the two wander through a New York filled with flower children, drugged-out hippies and outraged tourists who don’t approve of the wild goings-on. In one song, Claude poignantly sings, “Why do I live, why do I die, tell me where do I go, tell me why.” The show is playful and chaotic, but there’s also a sense of outrage in its protests against war, racism, sexism, pollution and the general hypocrisy of an era dominated by the American involvement in Vietnam. “I’d still like ‘Hair’ to be about what it was about then,” Rado told The Associated Press in 1993. “‘Hair’ had a spiritual message, and it has a mystical message I hope is coming through — there’s more to life than the way it’s been devised for us, explained to us, taught to us.” The songs of “Hair” have been used in everything from the films “Forrest Gump,” “Minions” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to TV shows like “Glee,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and “My Name Is Earl.” Billboard magazine lists “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” at No. 66 of all-time top 100 songs. In 2019, the original 1968 Broadway cast recording was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden deemed “these aural treasures worthy of preservation because of their cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.” Rado was born in Venice, California, and raised in Rochester, New York, and Washington, D.C. After serving two years in the U.S. Navy, he moved to New York and studied acting with Paula and Lee Strasberg. Rado was part of the ensemble of the Broadway play “Marathon ’33” in 1963 and played Richard Lionheart in “The Lion in Winter” in 1966 opposite Christopher Walken. He met Ragni when he was cast in the off-Broadway musical “Hang Down Your Head and Die.” The two were interested in birthing a new kind of show and focused on the hippie scene. They wrote the script while sharing an apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. Rado originated the “Hair” role of the draftee Claude on Broadway. “Hair” met resistance across the country. In addition to the use of four-letter words, the flouting of authority, sexual references and gross-out humor, the end of Act 1 had the entire cast strip naked to “Where Do I Go” and there was what many believed was desecration of the American flag. There were church pickets in Evansville, Indiana. Municipal officials in Chattanooga, Tennessee, denied a request to stage the show, determining that it would not be “in the best interest of the community.” In Denver, police threatened to arrest anyone who appeared nude onstage. A Boston visit was challenged in court on the basis of flag desecration. The original Public Theater production had cut the nude scene, but the creators wanted it back for the Broadway debut. Under the law at that time, New York City allowed nudity onstage onstage as long as the actors weren’t moving, which is why the whole cast of “Hair” stood together in a row, nude and perfectly still. After “Hair,” Rado wrote the music and lyrics of the off-Broadway show “Rainbow,” co-authoring the book with his brother, Ted Rado. He later teamed up with Ragni to create the book and lyrics for the show “Sun.” Ragni died in 1991. Rado wrote a new show called “American Soldier” with his brother. In 2009, Rado, MacDermot and Ragni were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., of the group The Fifth Dimension, were joined onstage by the Broadway cast at the time for a finale that brought the ceremony’s approximately 1,000 guests to their feet. MacDermot died in 2018. Rado told the Hudson Reporter in 2009 that none of the show’s creators anticipated that it would have such an enormous impact. “We thought we’d stumbled on a great idea, and something that potentially could be a hit on Broadway, never thinking of the distant future.” He is survived by his brother Ted Rado, sister-in-law Kay Rado, nieces Melanie Khoury, Emily DiBona and Melissa Stuart, great-nieces and a great-nephew. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"
4,David Muir Swiftly Shuts Down Chris Christie After His Jan. 6 Comparison,entertainment,"  ABC News anchor David Muir shut down Chris Christie’s attempt to compare the 2000 and 2016 presidential election results with the GOP-backed attempt to overturn the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. Muir, during the network’s coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings on Tuesday, pointed out that Republicans across the country are running campaigns based on claims of a “faulty” 2020 presidential election. Christie, a former New Jersey governor who headed Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, claimed former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016 and supporters of then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 refused to accept the “legitimate” results of their presidential defeats long before Jan. 6. Clinton conceded following the 2016 election and Gore acknowledged his 2000 loss after a Florida recount battle. “This is a very dangerous thing in this country, which was brought to a new level in 2020 by Donald Trump and his campaign,” Christie said. Muir interrupted. “I just don’t want our audience to think I’m not aware that there isn’t a real equivalency here when you have a former president who is sowing seeds of doubt,” Muir said. You can watch the moment Muir cuts Christie off below.

5,Fox News Anchor Calls Out 'Stunning' Lack Of Evidence For Trump Election Fraud Claim,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Tuesday called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Donald Trump’s election-fraud claims during the latest hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, The Hill reported. MacCallum said a rift among Republicans over whether to buy into the former president’s continued allegations of cheating will be exploited by the Democratic-dominated House panel investigating the Capitol riot, according to the news outlet. “The lack of evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these people are saying, ‘Look I supported you, please give me something to work with,’ and it simply doesn’t materialize,” MacCallum said, per The Hill. Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified Tuesday that Trump and his lawyers pressured him to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... anything that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of Trump’s fraud claims. Trump in May accused Fox News, which amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 results and got sued for it, of failing to spread his falsehoods. He said it decreased the conservative channel’s ratings. “That’s the one subject they don’t want to talk about,” the ex-president said. McCallum on Tuesday said the hearings could influence Trump’s decision on whether to run in 2024. “We never wanna see what we saw happen on Jan. 6 at the Capitol ever happen again,” she added.

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Newt Gingrich's Kamala Harris Insult Barrage Might Be Beneath Even Him,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Far-right pot-stirrer Newt Gingrich mocked Vice President Kamala Harris’ qualifications to be president on Fox News Tuesday. (Watch the video below.) The former House speaker, a guest on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” launched a dismissive, demeaning and somewhat racist broadside against the veep, frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic successor to President Joe Biden. Gingrich attacked her intelligence and called her a prospect “crazy enough to satisfy the left” who checks the box of “being a woman of color.” “She doesn’t know anything, she doesn’t know how to learn anything, she’s inarticulate, and she’s not sure what the big words mean anyway,” he said. Gingrich previously said Harris “may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president in American history.” If Biden doesn’t seek reelection, Harris would be the leading Democratic candidate to replace him by a fairly wide margin, according to a recent poll. Biden has said he intends to stand for reelection, especially if Donald Trump runs. Gingrich called the prospect of Harris assuming the presidency under “terrible” circumstances “horrifying.” She would “achieve worst president in American history, I think, within 30 days,” Gingrich said.

8,Baltimore Ravens Linebacker Jaylon Ferguson Dies At Age 26,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens who played in 10 games last season, has died. He was 26. “We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,” the team said in a statement on Wednesday. “He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon’s family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon.” Ferguson, a father of three young children with fiancée Doni Smith, was due to report to training camp for his fourth season in late July. He practiced last week with the Ravens at a minicamp where he sprained his ankle, the Baltimore Sun reported. Police found an unresponsive Ferguson being tended to by medics in Baltimore Tuesday night and told the newspaper there was no initial indication of “trauma or foul play.” The cause of death has not yet been determined. Ferguson played all three of his NFL seasons with the Ravens, appearing in 38 games. The Ravens made him a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2019. “The last person I talked to leaving the facility,” Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen tweeted. “Spent almost everyday in the sauna together tryna see who gone last longer. Said it was our turn this year man. Ima miss you bro.” Ferguson’s agent, Safarrah Lawson, said in a statement shared by ESPN: “He will be remembered not just as a football player, but as a great father, son, brother and friend.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Watch Lebanese Dance Troupe Unleash The Artistry of Arab Women On 'AGT',entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The Mayyas dance troupe set out to “prove to the world what Arab women can do, the arts we can create,” one member said on Tuesday’s “America’s Got Talent.” (Watch the video below.) Mission accomplished. The Lebanese troupe amazed the panelists and audience with coordinated arm movements that generated a kaleidoscopic vibe and a creature-like illusion. The routine delivered on Mayyas’ promise to “hypnotize.” The same performer said earlier in the segment that “being a dancer as a female Arab is not fully supported yet” ― but Simon Cowell said the group’s performance will make a difference. He called them “arguably the best dance act.” Judge Sofia Vergara gave perhaps the highest compliment, pushing the Golden Buzzer to vault the team to the live rounds. The former “Modern Family” star told the group she was “so honored to empower you even more.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Tom Hanks Reveals Why He Can’t Stop Crashing His Fans’ Weddings,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Tom Hanks shared on Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” why in recent years he’s become a serial wedding crasher at his fans’ weddings, whether he’s “invited or not.” The “Elvis” actor, who loves to hilariously photobomb his supporters on their big day, revealed why he has a passion for wedding crashing. “It’s my ego, unchecked,” Hanks said jokingly. He added: “I just can’t help but think, ‘What would these people like more than anything else to remember this magic day of days? Oh, I know, me!’” In March, Hanks stunned a bride when he united with her bridal party outside of a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh to take photos. The group was preparing to leave the venue when the longtime actor pulled up to join in on the snapshot session. The bride, Grace Gwaltney, shared that she was blown away to see the star. “He was like, ‘Hey! I’m Tom Hanks. I would love to get a photo with you,’ and I immediately froze and was just looking around,” Gwaltney told KCRA at the time. “I didn’t know what to do.” Hanks, who was declared a “man of many hats” by the show’s host, has crashed so many weddings that Meyers showcased the actor’s best wedding-crasher moments during the episode, with some clips even dating back to the early 2000s. The movie heavyweight also explained the time he took his affinity for wedding crashing internationally, after he stumbled upon a bride’s wedding while filming 2009’s “Angels and Demons” in Rome. Hanks told Meyers that the set crew wasn’t privy that a wedding party had booked the venue they were filming in, the Pantheon, on the same day. “This limousine pulled up, and it was the bride and the groom trying to ‘get me to the church on time,’” Hanks said. “And they couldn’t do it because we had all this stuff going on.” “It was like ‘Uh, how do we fix this?’ So, like a stalker — you know, ‘Hey miss, miss, miss!’ — I knocked on the window, I said ‘Hey listen, we have a thing, but would you do me the honor of escorting you to your bridal altar?’ So we did it!” the actor recalled. Hanks then joked to Meyers that the couple may not have initially recognized him at the time due to his “chemically straightened hair,” he said, pointing to his hairstyle in the throwback photo from the ceremony. “I don’t like to think I crashed a wedding. I provided a service,” the leading man added. “Elvis,” in which Hanks plays manager to the rock ‘n’ roll icon, hits theaters on Friday. Watch the trailer below. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

It’s like watching an old man try to mooch an extra pancake at the Denny’s.” See more in Colbert’s Tuesday night monologue: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
13,Kim Kardashian Reveals How She Knew When To Introduce Pete Davidson To Her Kids,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian revealed that she relied on the advice of one of her sisters when it came to figuring out the right time to introduce her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, to her four children. The SKKN by Kim founder, who shares North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm with her ex Kanye West, spoke to Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on “Today”  Tuesday about why she decided to wait six months for the big meeting. “Luckily I have a sister that has been through it all, and we talked about it,” Kardashian said, seemingly referencing her older sister, Kourtney, who has navigated co-parenting with her ex, Scott Disick, over the years. “I consulted with a few therapists and friends that have been through it,” the reality star added. “I definitely wanted to wait six months. And that was the marker.” But in her mind, there isn’t a perfect formula for navigating new relationships with kids. “I think it’s different for everyone,” Kardashian explained. “Different things work for different people, but you just have to do what feels right and try to be as respectful and cautious as possible.” Kotb and Guthrie also asked the Skims creator if her new relationship with the former “Saturday Night Live” star took her “by surprise.” “It did,” Kardashian answered with a smile, but said that she also “waited a while” before jumping into something new. “I waited, like, a good 10 months before I was ready to open myself up,” she said. “And I think you definitely need that time to yourself. And then once you’re ready to get out there, I felt like I just wanted new energy and something different. And it definitely took me by surprise.” Kardashian spoke about the difficulties both she and her family faced during her marriage to West, who now goes by Ye, on a recent episode of the Kardashian’s Hulu reality show. “I do recognize the impact that my relationship has had on my family and that I’ve never had the opportunity to just say, ‘I’m sorry, guys,’” Kardashian said during the episode, which aired in May. “I can’t control how he treats me or how he has always treated you guys,” she added. “I protected that for so long, but I said, ‘I will never let that happen to you guys again.’ For once in my life, I feel strong. I am not going to let anyone treat you guys a way or myself.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Elliot Page Says Life Has 'Drastically' Improved Since Coming Out As Trans,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life has only gotten better for Elliot Page since coming out as transgender. The “Umbrella Academy” star opened up about feeling a “degree of joy” he never thought possible on Tuesday’s episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” sharing that he’s learned to tune out people’s negative reactions. “It’s improved my life drastically,” Page said about transitioning. “I hope, you know, I hope maybe people who do have an issue with me can maybe try and hear that, or embrace that on some level.” “What I want to focus on right now and has been so extraordinary is the degree of joy that I feel, the degree of presence that I feel,” he added. “I feel a way that I really never thought possible for a long, long time.” While Page’s loved ones have been supportive, the actor has previously spoken about the “hatred and cruelty” he’s received since publicly disclosing that he is a transgender man in late 2020, including being verbally accosted by a stranger on the street. Page said certain “moments can be overwhelming,” but he’s choosing to concentrate on the positive, despite the spate of anti-trans bills that are rolling out across the nation. “I feel like it’s one of those things where it’s so unfortunate because it’s like, we’re all on the same team here, you know?” he told Meyers, adding that everybody faces “limits and constraints because of people’s obsession with the binary” regardless of their gender identity. The actor added, “To me, it’d be so special for us to all be able to connect and talk about how similar we are in all of our journeys.” Ultimately, Page said transitioning “made me better” both as a person and as an actor. Mirroring Page’s own real-life experience, his character on Netflix’s superhero series “Umbrella Academy,” who previously presented as female, comes out as transgender in the new season, which premiered on Wednesday. The character’s transition has drawn praise from fans and critics alike with Page explaining that showrunner Steve Blackman was “really excited about incorporating it into the show” and remarking that he feels “proud of it and excited for people to see it.” “It’s a beautiful thing to experience now,” Page said. “Because a lot of the time my life was just trying to move forward, so getting to embrace the experience as much as I get to now, I think it’s made me better in so many facets. As a person, as a friend, relationships.” Page plans to release a memoir next year about his journey. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

In an interview with Closer Weekly published Monday, the “Apocalypse Now” star said that he wishes he used his actual name when he was starting out as an actor. “That’s one of my regrets,” he told the magazine. “I never changed my name officially. It’s still Ramon Estévez on my birth certificate. It’s on my marriage license, my passport, driver’s license.” He chalked up the decision of being naive when he first started in show business. “Sometimes you get persuaded when you don’t have enough insight or even enough courage to stand up for what you believe in, and you pay for it later,” he said. “But, of course, I’m only speaking for myself.” He added that when his son, Emilio Estévez, first started acting professionally, he advised his son to stay true to his name. “The only influence I had on Emilio was to keep his name,” Sheen told Closer. “When he started out, his agent was advising him to change his name to Sheen and he wouldn’t do it. And I thank God he didn’t.” Sheen’s other famous son, Charlie Sheen, didn’t take the same advice — initially. In 2013, he was credited in Robert Rodriguez‘s film “Machete Kills” by his real name, Carlos Estévez, in the title cards. But in 2017’s “Mad Families,” Charlie Sheen was credited by his professional name. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Watch Lebanese Dance Troupe Unleash The Artistry of Arab Women On 'AGT',entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The Mayyas dance troupe set out to “prove to the world what Arab women can do, the arts we can create,” one member said on Tuesday’s “America’s Got Talent.” (Watch the video below.) Mission accomplished. The Lebanese troupe amazed the panelists and audience with coordinated arm movements that generated a kaleidoscopic vibe and a creature-like illusion. The routine delivered on Mayyas’ promise to “hypnotize.” The same performer said earlier in the segment that “being a dancer as a female Arab is not fully supported yet” ― but Simon Cowell said the group’s performance will make a difference. He called them “arguably the best dance act.” Judge Sofia Vergara gave perhaps the highest compliment, pushing the Golden Buzzer to vault the team to the live rounds. The former “Modern Family” star told the group she was “so honored to empower you even more.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,"Tony Siragusa, Former NFL Star, Dead At 55",entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
8,Democrats Pan Joe Biden's Call For A Gas Tax Holiday,entertainment," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on President Joe Biden’s call for a gas tax holiday, arguing that oil companies would pocket the savings rather than passing it on to consumers. The resistance from key members of Biden’s own party highlights the dismal prospects for the proposal in Congress, even as it was eagerly embraced by Democratic governors and other legislators facing tough reelection battles in 2022. “We can give families just a little bit of relief,” Biden said at a Wednesday afternoon event to pitch his proposal. “I call on the companies to pass every penny of this 18-cent reduction on to the consumers. This is no time for profiteering.” Earlier in the day, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, called the proposal a “shortsighted and inefficient way to provide relief.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also expressed skepticism. “I’d like to see some of the data and some of the states that have tried that, whether that’s actually resulted in fully lower gas prices,” he said in an interview with HuffPost. Biden is urging Congress to pass a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-a-gallon tax on diesel. The proposal should be enacted in such a way as to not affect funding for road projects that rely on federal gas tax revenue, he said. Biden is also calling on more governors to suspend their state gas taxes. Several Republican governors have already moved to do so, including in Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. The average price of gas in the U.S. has hovered around $5 a gallon this week. Biden blamed a recent spike in prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on energy-rich Russia ― an argument with merit, even if gas prices had risen significantly even before the invasion. “For all those Republicans in Congress criticizing me for high gas prices in America, are you now saying we were wrong to support Ukraine?” Biden said. “Are you saying we would rather have low gas prices in America than Putin’s iron first in Europe?” A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows how dominant gas prices have become as a political and economic issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said the price of gas is the economic problem worrying them the most right now, compared to just 11% who said the stock market and 3% who said their personal job situation. And 68% of Americans said the price of gasoline has been at least a somewhat serious problem for their family, while 55% said it caused them to cut back on household spending and 40% said it caused them to change their summer vacation plans. The pain at the pump has rattled Democrats about their fortunes in the coming midterm elections. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, in particular, have been pushing for a federal gas tax holiday for months. “While I am encouraged that the President now supports a gas tax holiday, I continue to believe that we should seek to suspend the gas tax for at least the rest of the year, not just 90 days,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Hassan has made a call for a gas tax holiday a centerpiece of her reelection bid. Democratic governors, who don’t have a vote on the controversial idea, greeted the proposal in a warmer fashion. Biden praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for offering relief for high prices. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on Biden to work with Congress to “offer American families real relief at the pump.” “Getting this done will save Michiganders money right now,” the Democrat said in a video posted to Twitter. But the opposition within Congress could doom the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly dismissed it, calling the move “very showbiz.” “The con is that the oil companies do not necessarily pass that on to the consumer ... you cannot write a law that requires them to pass it on,” Pelosi said earlier this year. Economists have also argued that a gas tax holiday could make inflation even worse. Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said that consumers are in less of a position to benefit from a gas tax holiday today than they were six months ago because of supply issues. Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in February it is a worse idea now. Refineries are even more constrained now so supply is nearly fully inelastic. Most of the 18.4 cent reduction would be pocketed by industry--with maybe a few cents passed on to consumers.

9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Elliot Page Says Life Has 'Drastically' Improved Since Coming Out As Trans,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life has only gotten better for Elliot Page since coming out as transgender. The “Umbrella Academy” star opened up about feeling a “degree of joy” he never thought possible on Tuesday’s episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” sharing that he’s learned to tune out people’s negative reactions. “It’s improved my life drastically,” Page said about transitioning. “I hope, you know, I hope maybe people who do have an issue with me can maybe try and hear that, or embrace that on some level.” “What I want to focus on right now and has been so extraordinary is the degree of joy that I feel, the degree of presence that I feel,” he added. “I feel a way that I really never thought possible for a long, long time.” While Page’s loved ones have been supportive, the actor has previously spoken about the “hatred and cruelty” he’s received since publicly disclosing that he is a transgender man in late 2020, including being verbally accosted by a stranger on the street. Page said certain “moments can be overwhelming,” but he’s choosing to concentrate on the positive, despite the spate of anti-trans bills that are rolling out across the nation. “I feel like it’s one of those things where it’s so unfortunate because it’s like, we’re all on the same team here, you know?” he told Meyers, adding that everybody faces “limits and constraints because of people’s obsession with the binary” regardless of their gender identity. The actor added, “To me, it’d be so special for us to all be able to connect and talk about how similar we are in all of our journeys.” Ultimately, Page said transitioning “made me better” both as a person and as an actor. Mirroring Page’s own real-life experience, his character on Netflix’s superhero series “Umbrella Academy,” who previously presented as female, comes out as transgender in the new season, which premiered on Wednesday. The character’s transition has drawn praise from fans and critics alike with Page explaining that showrunner Steve Blackman was “really excited about incorporating it into the show” and remarking that he feels “proud of it and excited for people to see it.” “It’s a beautiful thing to experience now,” Page said. “Because a lot of the time my life was just trying to move forward, so getting to embrace the experience as much as I get to now, I think it’s made me better in so many facets. As a person, as a friend, relationships.” Page plans to release a memoir next year about his journey. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Brad Pitt Gets Conned Into Hunting For Fake Buried Treasure At His French Mansion,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost In a stunning rebuke of today’s relatable celebrity culture, Brad Pitt revealed he spent a year hunting for buried medieval treasure that never existed beneath his French estate. Yes, for some reason the Oscar winner chose to come clean about getting swindled by an unnamed man who convinced him that the property he once shared with ex-wife Angelina Jolie was even more valuable than the estimated $60 million the former couple forked over for it back in 2008. Speaking with GQ in a profile published on Wednesday, Pitt said he was told that there were “millions of dollars worth of gold” left by the villa’s medieval owners that had been “taken from the Levant during the Crusades and buried on the grounds.” “I got obsessed,” said Pitt, who acquired radar equipment to hunt for the loot. “Like for a year, this was all I could think about, just the excitement of it all. Maybe it has something to do with where I grew up, because in the Ozark Mountains” near his childhood home in Missouri, “there were always stories of hidden caches of gold.” Ultimately, Pitt came up empty, and it was revealed that the man had targeted him as a potential investor in a radar company and (successfully) pitched the prospect of undiscovered riches to dupe the actor. Pitt said the ordeal left him feeling “pretty foolish in the end.” “It was just the hunt that was exciting,” he remarked. Despite the slightly embarrassing admission, there are grounds to believe buried treasure may lay beneath the historic villa. Pitt’s Château Miraval sits along an ancient Roman trade route and contains a sprawling estate and various structures, including the 13th-century chapel where he and Jolie wed. The château and its award-winning wine from the property’s vineyards have since become a major source of contention in the former couple’s ongoing divorce battle. After Jolie sold her stake in the business last year to Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, Pitt sued her in February, claiming she unlawfully disregarded their agreement never to sell their shares without the other’s permission. In a filing from Pitt’s legal team earlier this month, the actor claims Jolie “sought to inflict harm on” him by forcing him to partner with “a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions” who plans to launch a “hostile” takeover of the business. Jolie hasn’t commented on Pitt’s allegations or his hunt for fake treasure. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Tom Hanks Reveals Why He Can’t Stop Crashing His Fans’ Weddings,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Tom Hanks shared on Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” why in recent years he’s become a serial wedding crasher at his fans’ weddings, whether he’s “invited or not.” The “Elvis” actor, who loves to hilariously photobomb his supporters on their big day, revealed why he has a passion for wedding crashing. “It’s my ego, unchecked,” Hanks said jokingly. He added: “I just can’t help but think, ‘What would these people like more than anything else to remember this magic day of days? Oh, I know, me!’” In March, Hanks stunned a bride when he united with her bridal party outside of a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh to take photos. The group was preparing to leave the venue when the longtime actor pulled up to join in on the snapshot session. The bride, Grace Gwaltney, shared that she was blown away to see the star. “He was like, ‘Hey! I’m Tom Hanks. I would love to get a photo with you,’ and I immediately froze and was just looking around,” Gwaltney told KCRA at the time. “I didn’t know what to do.” Hanks, who was declared a “man of many hats” by the show’s host, has crashed so many weddings that Meyers showcased the actor’s best wedding-crasher moments during the episode, with some clips even dating back to the early 2000s. The movie heavyweight also explained the time he took his affinity for wedding crashing internationally, after he stumbled upon a bride’s wedding while filming 2009’s “Angels and Demons” in Rome. Hanks told Meyers that the set crew wasn’t privy that a wedding party had booked the venue they were filming in, the Pantheon, on the same day. “This limousine pulled up, and it was the bride and the groom trying to ‘get me to the church on time,’” Hanks said. “And they couldn’t do it because we had all this stuff going on.” “It was like ‘Uh, how do we fix this?’ So, like a stalker — you know, ‘Hey miss, miss, miss!’ — I knocked on the window, I said ‘Hey listen, we have a thing, but would you do me the honor of escorting you to your bridal altar?’ So we did it!” the actor recalled. Hanks then joked to Meyers that the couple may not have initially recognized him at the time due to his “chemically straightened hair,” he said, pointing to his hairstyle in the throwback photo from the ceremony. “I don’t like to think I crashed a wedding. I provided a service,” the leading man added. “Elvis,” in which Hanks plays manager to the rock ‘n’ roll icon, hits theaters on Friday. Watch the trailer below. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
13,"James Rado, Co-Creator Of Groundbreaking Musical ‘Hair,’ Dead At 90",entertainment," NEW YORK (AP) — James Rado, co-creator of the groundbreaking hippie musical “Hair,” which celebrated protest, pot and free love and paved the way for the sound of rock on Broadway, has died. He was 90. Rado died Tuesday night in New York City of cardio respiratory arrest, according to friend and publicist Merle Frimark. “Hair,” which has a story and lyrics by Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot, was the first rock musical on Broadway, the first Broadway show to feature full nudity and the first to feature a same-sex kiss. “Hair” made possible other rock musicals like “Jesus Christ Superstar” and “Rent.” Like “Hamilton,” it was one of only a handful of Broadway shows in the past few decades to find its songs on the pop charts. The so-called “American tribal love-rock musical,” had its world premiere at the Public Theater in New York City’s East Village in 1967 and transferred the following year to Broadway, where the musical ran more than 1,800 performances. Rado played Claude, a young man about to be drafted and sent to the war in Vietnam. Clive Barnes, theater critic for The New York Times, called the show “the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.” The New York Post said it had “unintentional charm,” contagious high spirits and a “young zestfulness” that “make it difficult to resist.” Variety, however, called it “loony.” It lost the Tony in 1969 to the more traditional “1776” but won a Grammy Award. The 2009 revival won the best revival Tony. The show was revived on Broadway in 1977 and again in 2009. It was made into a movie directed by Milos Forman in 1979 starring Treat Williams and Beverly D’Angelo. “Hair” spawned four top four singles on the American pop charts, including the No. 1 hit “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” by the Fifth Dimension, which won the Grammy Award for record of the year and best pop vocal performance by a group in 1970. Others included “Hair” by the Cowsills, “Good Morning, Starshine” by the singer Oliver and “Easy to Be Hard” by Three Dog Night. The cast album itself stayed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks “Hair” tells the story of Claude and Berger, best buddies who find freedom in the late 1960s. Between draft-card burnings, love-ins, bad LSD trips and a parade of protest marches, the two wander through a New York filled with flower children, drugged-out hippies and outraged tourists who don’t approve of the wild goings-on. In one song, Claude poignantly sings, “Why do I live, why do I die, tell me where do I go, tell me why.” The show is playful and chaotic, but there’s also a sense of outrage in its protests against war, racism, sexism, pollution and the general hypocrisy of an era dominated by the American involvement in Vietnam. “I’d still like ‘Hair’ to be about what it was about then,” Rado told The Associated Press in 1993. “‘Hair’ had a spiritual message, and it has a mystical message I hope is coming through — there’s more to life than the way it’s been devised for us, explained to us, taught to us.” The songs of “Hair” have been used in everything from the films “Forrest Gump,” “Minions” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to TV shows like “Glee,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and “My Name Is Earl.” Billboard magazine lists “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” at No. 66 of all-time top 100 songs. In 2019, the original 1968 Broadway cast recording was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden deemed “these aural treasures worthy of preservation because of their cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.” Rado was born in Venice, California, and raised in Rochester, New York, and Washington, D.C. After serving two years in the U.S. Navy, he moved to New York and studied acting with Paula and Lee Strasberg. Rado was part of the ensemble of the Broadway play “Marathon ’33” in 1963 and played Richard Lionheart in “The Lion in Winter” in 1966 opposite Christopher Walken. He met Ragni when he was cast in the off-Broadway musical “Hang Down Your Head and Die.” The two were interested in birthing a new kind of show and focused on the hippie scene. They wrote the script while sharing an apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. Rado originated the “Hair” role of the draftee Claude on Broadway. “Hair” met resistance across the country. In addition to the use of four-letter words, the flouting of authority, sexual references and gross-out humor, the end of Act 1 had the entire cast strip naked to “Where Do I Go” and there was what many believed was desecration of the American flag. There were church pickets in Evansville, Indiana. Municipal officials in Chattanooga, Tennessee, denied a request to stage the show, determining that it would not be “in the best interest of the community.” In Denver, police threatened to arrest anyone who appeared nude onstage. A Boston visit was challenged in court on the basis of flag desecration. The original Public Theater production had cut the nude scene, but the creators wanted it back for the Broadway debut. Under the law at that time, New York City allowed nudity onstage onstage as long as the actors weren’t moving, which is why the whole cast of “Hair” stood together in a row, nude and perfectly still. After “Hair,” Rado wrote the music and lyrics of the off-Broadway show “Rainbow,” co-authoring the book with his brother, Ted Rado. He later teamed up with Ragni to create the book and lyrics for the show “Sun.” Ragni died in 1991. Rado wrote a new show called “American Soldier” with his brother. In 2009, Rado, MacDermot and Ragni were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., of the group The Fifth Dimension, were joined onstage by the Broadway cast at the time for a finale that brought the ceremony’s approximately 1,000 guests to their feet. MacDermot died in 2018. Rado told the Hudson Reporter in 2009 that none of the show’s creators anticipated that it would have such an enormous impact. “We thought we’d stumbled on a great idea, and something that potentially could be a hit on Broadway, never thinking of the distant future.” He is survived by his brother Ted Rado, sister-in-law Kay Rado, nieces Melanie Khoury, Emily DiBona and Melissa Stuart, great-nieces and a great-nephew. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"
14,Kim Kardashian Reveals How She Knew When To Introduce Pete Davidson To Her Kids,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian revealed that she relied on the advice of one of her sisters when it came to figuring out the right time to introduce her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, to her four children. The SKKN by Kim founder, who shares North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm with her ex Kanye West, spoke to Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on “Today”  Tuesday about why she decided to wait six months for the big meeting. “Luckily I have a sister that has been through it all, and we talked about it,” Kardashian said, seemingly referencing her older sister, Kourtney, who has navigated co-parenting with her ex, Scott Disick, over the years. “I consulted with a few therapists and friends that have been through it,” the reality star added. “I definitely wanted to wait six months. And that was the marker.” But in her mind, there isn’t a perfect formula for navigating new relationships with kids. “I think it’s different for everyone,” Kardashian explained. “Different things work for different people, but you just have to do what feels right and try to be as respectful and cautious as possible.” Kotb and Guthrie also asked the Skims creator if her new relationship with the former “Saturday Night Live” star took her “by surprise.” “It did,” Kardashian answered with a smile, but said that she also “waited a while” before jumping into something new. “I waited, like, a good 10 months before I was ready to open myself up,” she said. “And I think you definitely need that time to yourself. And then once you’re ready to get out there, I felt like I just wanted new energy and something different. And it definitely took me by surprise.” Kardashian spoke about the difficulties both she and her family faced during her marriage to West, who now goes by Ye, on a recent episode of the Kardashian’s Hulu reality show. “I do recognize the impact that my relationship has had on my family and that I’ve never had the opportunity to just say, ‘I’m sorry, guys,’” Kardashian said during the episode, which aired in May. “I can’t control how he treats me or how he has always treated you guys,” she added. “I protected that for so long, but I said, ‘I will never let that happen to you guys again.’ For once in my life, I feel strong. I am not going to let anyone treat you guys a way or myself.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Christian Bale Didn’t Know What The MCU Was Before 'Thor: Love And Thunder',entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Actor Christian Bale was unaware he had entered any kind of “cinematic universe” when he joined the cast of Marvel’s “Thor: Love And Thunder.” The actor — who played Gotham’s caped crusader in the “Dark Knight” trilogy — recently told Total Film he didn’t even know what the acronym “MCU” (Marvel Cinematic Universe) stood for before he ditched DC Comics for the opposing multiverse. “I’d read that, and people would go, ‘Oh, look at this! He’s entered the MCU!’ And I’d go, ‘I’ve done what? I haven’t entered shit, thank you very much,’” Bale said. “I’m like, ‘The MCU?’ I had to ask what that was.” The Oscar-winner also recounted the hilarious moment he learned about his character, Gorr the God Butcher, a sinister Marvel supervillain he didn’t even know existed. “I did make the mistake of Googling [Gorr] and, oh no! [In the comics,] he runs around in a G-string all the time,” Bale told Total Film. He added: “And I thought, ‘They don’t have the right man for that!’ And then [director Taika Waititi] quickly dispelled any notions of running around in that.” Christian Bale on researching for #Gorr:I know what he does. It's right there in the name, isn't it? But I did make the mistake of Googling him and, oh no! [In the comics] he runs around in a G-string all the time, and I thought, 'They don't have the right man for that!’ pic.twitter.com/nGs3EDWS5a Asked if he had any reservations about portraying another comic book character after playing Batman to critical acclaim, Bale rapidly banished the notion. “Absolutely not, no. That didn’t even enter into my head at all,” he said. The Method actor also shared that he and Waititi had discussed making the character less serious and that he’d wanted to add a dance sequence inspired by singer Kate Bush, who recently enjoyed a resurgence in “Stranger Things.” “There’s obviously sort of a ‘Nosferatu’ slight attitude,” Bale said. “Taika and I wanted to do a whole dance, which we didn’t get to do, but we had all this sort of Kate Bush stuff that we worked at. But I think he just realized he was never going to be allowed to put that in the final film.” “Thor: Love And Thunder,” the fourth installment of the “Thor” franchise, is set to hit theaters on July 8.

0,Judge In Italy Reportedly Extends Hotel Detention For Film Director Paul Haggis,entertainment," BRINDISI, Italy (AP) — A judge in southern Italy on Wednesday ordered Academy Award-winning film director Paul Haggis to remain under detention at his hotel while Italian prosecutors continue to investigate a woman’s allegations that he had sex with her over two days without her consent, Italian news reports said. After conducting a hearing that lasted several hours in the Brindisi courthouse, Judge Vilma Gilli issued the ruling that extends his detention for now in the hotel in the town of Ostuni, where he was supposed to participate in an arts festival this week, Corriere della Sera daily reported. Calls Wednesday evening to Villi’s office went unanswered. The Ansa and LaPresse news agencies said Villi had concluded that while the 69-year-old Haggis, who lives in the United States, isn’t a flight risk, there was the “danger” evidence could be compromised or that the alleged crime could be repeated. Haggis’ lawyer, Michele Laforgia, said after the hearing that his client reiterated his total innocence and is in “hopeful expectation” that he will be ultimately vindicated. “Paul Haggis answered all questions and explained what happened,” Laforgia told reporters outside the courthouse. “He declared himself, as he had already done right after the detention, completely innocent, in the sense that the sex he had with this woman was totally consensual.” While the woman’s allegations are investigated, the 69-year-old Canadian-born director, producer and screenwriter was initially ordered on Sunday to stay detained in his guest residence in a farmhouse in Ostuni, a popular tourist town in Puglia, the region forming the “heel” of the Italian peninsula. Prosecutors have said he is under investigation for alleged aggravated sexual violence and aggravated personal injuries. Prosecutors have described the woman as young and foreign. State TV and other Italian media said she is a 30-year-old Englishwoman who had known Haggis before he came to Ostuni to participate in an arts festival that began this week. Haggis co-wrote, directed and produced “Crash,” which won the 2006 Academy Awards for best picture and best screenplay. He also wrote the screenplay for “Million Dollar Baby,” another Oscar winner. He has had legal problems in recent years stemming from sexual misconduct accusations by four women in the United States."
1,Stephen Colbert Spots Trump's Most 'Pathetic' Moment Yet,entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Stephen Colbert spotted a revealing moment for Donald Trump ― one the “Late Show” host said proves just how “pathetic” the former president truly is. In new audio played during Tuesday’s Jan. 6 committee hearings, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “I only need 11,000 votes,” Trump said during the phone call after the election. “Fellas, I need 11,000 votes, give me a break.” “That is just pathetic,” Colbert said after airing the audio. “He’s literally begging them to invent votes for him. It’s like watching an old man try to mooch an extra pancake at the Denny’s.” See more in Colbert’s Tuesday night monologue: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

Then, Jovi Crusen delivered an unforgettable rendition of the song from the 2000 Phish album “Farmhouse.” She had the audience cheering ― and Anastasio grinning from ear to ear: “I wasn’t nervous but I had to take a big breath just to keep the tears away,” Jovi told the JamBase website. “I like ‘Bug’ because I get to raise my voice and sometimes yell ‘Bug!’ It’s fun to sing.” Here’s the original for comparison: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Giuliani, who led Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and remain in power despite losing the presidential vote, apparently admitted he didn’t have any facts to back his outlandish claims of widespread voter fraud. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers said at the committee hearing Tuesday that Giuliani had told him before the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol: “We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence.” Bowers said he and others who heard the candid comments “kind of laughed about it.” Hayes had a more explicit reaction. “So as long as we’re presenting theories without evidence, I have a theory about Rudy Giuliani that the reason he smokes cigars is because he’s trying to break his habit of chewing on dildos,” he offered, quickly adding: “I don’t have any evidence.” See more in his Tuesday night monologue as Kimmel is taking the summer off and letting Hayes and other guests take the mic: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

13,"Bill Cosby Sexually Abused Teenager In 1975, Civil Jury Rules",entertainment," SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — Jurors at a civil trial found Tuesday that Bill Cosby sexually abused a 16-year-old girl at the Playboy Mansion in 1975. The Los Angeles County jury delivered the verdict in favor of Judy Huth, who is now 64, and awarded her $500,000. Jurors found that Cosby intentionally caused harmful sexual contact with Huth, that he reasonably believed she was under 18, and that his conduct was driven by unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in a minor. The jurors’ decision is a major legal defeat for the 84-year-old entertainer once hailed as America’s dad. It comes nearly a year after his Pennsylvania criminal conviction for sexual assault was thrown out and he was freed from prison. Huth’s lawsuit was one of the last remaining legal claims against him after his insurer settled many others against his will. Cosby did not attend the trial or testify in person, but short clips from 2015 video deposition were played for jurors, in which he denied any sexual contact with Huth. He continues to deny the allegation through his attorney and publicist. Jurors had already reached conclusions on nearly every question on their verdict form, including whether Cosby abused Huth and whether she deserved damages, after two days of deliberations on Friday. But the jury foreperson could not serve further because of a personal commitment, and the panel had to start deliberating from scratch with an alternate juror on Monday. Cosby’s attorneys agreed that Cosby met Huth and her high school friend on a Southern California film set in April of 1975, then took them to the Playboy Mansion a few days later. Huth’s friend Donna Samuelson, a key witness, took photos at the mansion of Huth and Cosby, which loomed large at the trial. Huth testified that in a bedroom adjacent to a game room where the three had been hanging out, Cosby attempted to put his hand down her pants, then exposed himself and forced her to perform a sex act. Huth filed her lawsuit in 2014, saying that her son turning 15 — the age she initially remembered being when she went to the mansion — and a wave of other women accusing Cosby of similar acts brought fresh trauma over what she had been through as a teenager. Huth’s attorney Nathan Goldberg told the jury of nine women and three men during closing arguments Wednesday that “my client deserves to have Mr. Cosby held accountable for what he did.” “Each of you knows in your heart that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted Miss Huth,” Goldberg said. A majority of jurors apparently agreed, giving Huth a victory in a suit that took eight years and overcame many hurdles just to get to trial. During their testimony, Cosby attorney Jennifer Bonjean consistently challenged Huth and Samuelson over errors in detail in their stories, and a similarity in the accounts that the lawyer said represented coordination between the two women. This included the women saying in pre-trial depositions and police interviews that Samuelson had played Donkey Kong that day, a game not released until six years later. Bonjean made much of this, in what both sides came to call the “Donkey Kong defense.” Goldberg asked jurors to look past the small errors in detail that he said were inevitable in stories that were 45 years old, and focus on the major issues behind the allegations. He pointed out to jurors that Samuelson said “games like Donkey Kong” when she first mentioned it in her deposition. The Cosby lawyer began her closing arguments by saying, “It’s on like Donkey Kong,” and finished by declaring, “game over.” Huth’s attorney reacted with outrage during his rebuttal. “This is about justice!” he shouted, pounding on the podium. “We don’t need game over! We need justice!” The Associated Press does not normally name people who say they have been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly, as Huth has. ___ AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton contributed to this report."
14,Kim Kardashian Responds To Claims She Damaged Marilyn Monroe's Dress,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian has broken her silence on claims that she damaged Marilyn Monroe’s vintage gown at last month’s Met Gala. Appearing on “Today” Tuesday, the reality TV icon dismissed media speculation that the dress had been stretched to the point of being “ripped” and “tattered,” and was now missing some of its rhinestones. “I showed up to the red carpet in a robe and slippers and I put the dress on at the bottom of the carpet, went up the stairs,” Kardashian recalled. “I probably had it on for three minutes, four minutes, and then I changed right at the top of the stairs.” “There were handlers in gloves that put it on me,” she added. Elsewhere in the interview, Kardashian said she held deep respect for Monroe, who died in 1962 at age 36, and understood “how much this dress means to American history.” We’re catching up with @KimKardashian about her relationship with Pete Davidson, wearing Marilyn Monroe’s dress, her newest business project that’s been years in the making and more! pic.twitter.com/Chsz8cK5FW Monroe wore the shimmery gown ― fitted with 2,500 rhinestones on sheer, nude-colored fabric ― to President John F. Kennedy’s 45th birthday celebration in 1962, where she crooned a sultry rendition of “Happy Birthday.” Kardashian has been hit with a barrage of criticism after borrowing the dress from its current owner, the Ripley’s Believe It or Not! museum, for the Met Gala, which she attended with boyfriend Pete Davidson. Among those to publicly disapprove of her wearing the dress was designer Bob Mackie, who sketched the original gown specifically for Monroe. “Nobody else should be seen in that dress,” he told Entertainment Weekly. The backlash began to intensify last week, after questions about the state in which Kardashian returned the dress were raised by ChadMichael Morrisette, a visual artist who regularly helps handle and display costumes. Morrisette, a longtime Monroe fan, said he spotted what he believed to be new damage to the dress on a recent visit to Ripley’s Believe It or Not! in Los Angeles. He later shared before and after images to support his claim with the Marilyn Monroe Collection. A post shared by The Marilyn Monroe Collection (@marilynmonroecollection) “I know the dress very well, I’ve seen it many times,” he told HuffPost last week. “I’ve photographed it many times, I have plenty of photographic evidence of what’s different now.” However, Ripley’s Believe It or Not! refuted Morrisette’s observations. Amanda Joiner, the museum’s vice president of publishing and licensing, released a statement last week indicating she was with the dress during its transport from Orlando, Florida, where it was last displayed, and on the day of the gala. “From the bottom of the Met steps, where Kim got into the dress, to the top where it was returned, the dress was in the same condition it started in,” she said. “No matter which side of the debate you are on, the historical importance of the dress has not been negated, but rather highlighted,” the statement continued. “A entirely new group of young people have now been introduced to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Harry Styles Helps Concert Attendee Come Out As Gay: 'You Are A Free Man',entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Harry Styles offered a playfully profound gesture of LGBTQ visibility this weekend by helping a young Italian fan come out as gay. During his performance at London’s Wembley Stadium on Sunday, the Grammy winner spotted the audience member who was carrying a sign that read: “From Ono to Wembley: Help me come out.” Styles, who has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights, was more than happy to oblige. Footage of the concert that appeared on social media shows the pop star picking up a rainbow flag from the front of the stage. “When this flag goes over the head, you are officially gay, my boy,” he tells the fan, as seen in the clip. After his band begins a drumroll, Styles teases raising the flag for a moment, and eventually hoists the banner into the air as the crowd roars. “Congratulations, you are a free man,” he proclaims. Harry helps a fan come out tonight at Wembley Stadium - June 19 🏳️‍🌈 (via @calsmoodswings) #LoveOnTourWembley pic.twitter.com/or0BbRkg1K Styles released his third album, “Harry’s House,” to great acclaim last month. Since then, he’s continued to make waves with a number of heartwarming fan interactions while performing across Europe and the U.K. on his Love On Tour. Last week, the singer took a moment to acknowledge his “first ever school teacher,” Ann Vernon, whom he thought was in attendance at his show in Manchester, England. He returns to the concert stage Wednesday with a performance in Dublin. This fall, Styles is slated to appear in two new movies, “Don’t Worry Darling” and “My Policeman.” In the latter film, he plays a closeted gay cop who finds himself ensnared in a love triangle between a museum curator (David Dawson) and a teacher (Emma Corrin).

0,Dave Chappelle Rejects His High School’s Offer To Name Theater After Him Amid Controversy,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Dave Chappelle announced that his alma mater, the Duke Ellington School of Arts, won’t carry his name on its theater. The comedy icon, who graduated from the Washington, D.C., public high school in 1991, shocked the audience at Monday’s ceremony dedicating the student theater when he made the announcement. The theater will instead be called the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression. Chappelle said during the ceremony that he declined the honor because he did not want his name to distract from students’ work. The Duke Ellington School of the Arts decided to rename the theater after Chappelle last year and scheduled a fundraiser in November. But the school postponed the event after controversy escalated following Chappelle’s Netflix special “The Closer,” which included graphic jokes about transgender women and the LGBTQ community. Chappelle in November urged people in an Instagram post to donate to the school regardless of whether they agree with his name on the theater. A post shared by Dave Chappelle (@davechappelle) “The Duke Ellington school is a glorious institution. Within those walls I found a context to explore my creativity seriously,” Chappelle wrote, adding: “My only intent is to insure Duke Ellington the opportunity to train its artists unfettered.” The Netflix special sparked a storm of controversy over Chappelle’s comments about the trans community. Duke Ellington students joined the outcry. Chappelle said Monday that criticism from students “sincerely hurt me.” “I took a lot of cold shots in business … but that day, they hurt me,” the stand-up icon told the bustling crowd at the ceremony. Chappelle said instead of outright rejecting the eponym, he would “defer” the renaming of his school’s theater in order to emphasize “the nuance of art” as well as “my right, my freedom of artistic expression” by renaming it the Theater of Artistic Freedom & Expression. After voicing his decision, which he said he made on Friday, the crowd erupted in applause and gave Chappelle a standing ovation. “No matter what they say about ‘The Closer,’ it is still (one of the) most-watched specials on Netflix,” Chappelle said. “The more you say I can’t say something, the more urgent it is for me to say it. It has nothing to do with what you are saying I can’t say. It has everything to do with my freedom of artistic expression.” Philip Lewis contributed reporting. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,"Sandra Bullock Says She's 'So Burnt Out' From Work, Will Take A Break From Acting",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sandra Bullock is ready for a break. “The Lost City” actor recently revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that she’s feeling “so burnt out” and is ready to return to life with her two children, Louis and Laila. “I don’t want to be beholden to anyone’s schedule other than my own,” Bullock told the outlet last week. “I’m so burnt out. I’m so tired, and I’m so not capable of making healthy, smart decisions and I know it,” the actor said. Asked how long she planned to take a break, she replied, “I really don’t know.” “Work has always been steady for me, and I’ve been so lucky,” Bullock added. “I realized it possibly was becoming my crutch.” But she remarked that it made her feel like she was “opening up a fridge all the time and looking for something that was never in the fridge.” “I said to myself, ‘Stop looking for it here because it doesn’t exist here. You already have it; establish it, find it and be OK not having work to validate you,’” she added. Bullock has been on a whirlwind press tour for her most recent movies but said that being in the public eye doesn’t come naturally to her. “I shrivel up when it comes to press, when it comes to being in public and when it comes to doing a photo shoot,” Bullock says. “I just collapse. I’m not good at that, but what I love is working in tandem with people to create something.” The “Bullet Train” actor has repeatedly spoken about her desire to step back from work and the spotlight for a bit. “I want to be at home,” Bullock told CBS’s “Sunday Morning” back in March. “So I’m not doing anyone any favors who’s investing in a project if I’m saying, ‘I just want to be at home.’ Because I was always running, I was always running to the next thing. I just want to be present and responsible for one thing.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,The Chicks' Mid-Concert Cancellation Turns Into Something Bigger,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The Chicks ended their concert prematurely in an Indianapolis suburb on Sunday and later canceled two other shows for what the group said were “doctor’s orders for vocal rest.” The country music band played for about 30 minutes at Noblesville’s Ruoff Music Center in Indiana before departing the stage. “Indianapolis, we are so sorry we could not give you the show you deserved OR the show we wanted to give you,” the band, formerly the Dixie Chicks, wrote on Instagram. “We will be back Indianapolis!! Hold onto your tickets.” Fans in attendance noted singer Natalie Maines appeared in vocal distress during the performance, Billboard reported. In a spectator’s video, the throat-clearing Maines told the crowd: “You all will get tickets, I promise. I just can’t … we’ll try one more song. Waiting for this shot to kick in … not a shot of alcohol, a shot of steroids.” A post shared by The Chicks (@thechicks) A message on Instagram later confirmed that postponements would extend to future shows as well. The band — comprised of Maines, Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer — said Monday they “are forced to postpone” some other Midwest dates on their tour, citing “doctor’s orders for vocal rest.” The post included rescheduled dates. A post shared by The Chicks (@thechicks) The Dixie Chicks won more than a dozen Grammy awards before they rebranded as The Chicks in 2020. The group dropped Dixie from its name because of the word’s association with the Confederacy and slavery. The trio released the single “March March” at the time, encouraging civil rights protests after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,"‘Stranger Things’ Season 4, Volume 2 Trailer Is Out, And Plays With Fan Theory",entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost The trailer for “Stranger Things” Season 4, Volume 2 is flaying fans’ minds. Warning: spoilers for Season 4 of “Stranger Things” below. Netflix released a trailer on Tuesday for the final two episodes of the season for its sci-fi smash hit, and the next installment looks pretty bleak. But on the bright side, it also features an Upside Down guitar solo, a little love for poor Will and even more Kate Bush. The trailer also seems to play with a fan theory that someone’s going to die. Many believe it’s going to be fan-favorite Steve (Joe Keery), thanks to Robin (Maya Hawke) telling him, “It might not work out for us this time,” in the trailer. With that, plus the many screenshots of Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) screaming, people are preparing themselves for the loss of the former shotgunning jerk turned lovable babysitter. But if being too liked on this show has proven to be a recipe for swift demise (R.I.P. Barb, Bob and Chrissy), then newcomer Eddie (Joseph Quinn) could also be the one to die. Or perhaps no one dies, and Erica (Priah Ferguson) could just obliterate the whole Upside Down with a side eye. We suppose we’ll find out who — if anyone — will perish when the two last episodes drop on July 1. Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Sign Chris Evans Up To Play Human Torch In Another 'Fantastic Four' Movie,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Long before he was known as America’s ass, a professional Lizzo flirter and famously not the toy version of Buzz Lightyear, Chris Evans flamed on as the Human Torch for two admittedly mediocre “Fantastic Four” movies. For many fans, the 2005 film and its sequel, “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,” starring Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Chiklis and Evans as the iconic superhero team, are best-forgotten artifacts of an age before Marvel found its groove. But Evans, who would, of course, go on to play a central role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Captain America, has decidedly fonder memories than the rest of us. “God, wouldn’t that be great?” Evans told MTV News when asked about playing Johnny Storm/Human Torch again. “Wouldn’t that be great? No, no one’s ever come to me about that. I mean, I don’t exactly look the same anymore. That was 15, almost 20 years ago. Oh my God, I’m old. But I really love that character, but I think … aren’t they doing something now with Fantastic Four?” Marvel is indeed developing an upcoming reboot of the “Fantastic Four,” but has yet to announce any casting or production details. The studio is also on the hunt for a new director after Jon Watts, who helmed the recent “Spider-Man” trilogy, exited the project in April. Surely it’s a bit of a, well, stretch to imagine Evans suiting up again as Storm, but given the boundless storytelling potential of Marvel’s newly established multiverse, stranger things have happened. After years of fan casting, John Krasinski made a cameo appearance as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic in the recent “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” but the studio has yet to announce whether the actor will continue with the role in future films. Evans, meanwhile, said that it would be an “easier sell” for him to play Storm again than Captain America. “Cap is so precious to me. And you know, I almost don’t wanna disrupt what a beautiful experience that was,” he continued. “But Johnny Storm, I feel like he didn’t really get his day. That was before Marvel really found its footing. So, I loved that role and, you know, who knows?” Despite its longstanding legacy in comic books, “Fantastic Four” has a checkered history on the big screen. The 2015 reboot starring Kate Mara, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan was an undisputed flop, with director Josh Trank publicly disowning the film ahead of its release. But surely, if there was anybody who could ignite the franchise once again, it’s Evans. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

Ruffin begins her song by seductively singing: “Is it the way you looked/ When the judge said you were guilty?/ Is it the way you sweat/ When you realize they have your texts?” Davis then joins in: “Is it the way you smiled/ When you took a selfie at the Capitol building?/ Is it the way you frowned/ When that picture got you thrown in jail?” After a chorus that repeats “Your sadness fills me with joy” to hilarious effect, Ruffin and Davis up the ante by bringing in ’80s soul legend (and Ruffin’s favorite artist) El DeBarge to boost the seditionist soul ballad into high gear: “Is it the way you thought/ You could get away with literal sedition?/Is it the way your friends/And family aren’t on your side?” You can see the video below. But a warning: This is the first anti-insurrectionist song that may make you want to slow dance with your special someone. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Watch The Dancing Magician Simon Cowell Calls 'Fantastically Good And ... Bad',entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jannick Holste rhapsodized about judge Heidi Klum and dancing in his pre-audition chat on “America’s Got Talent.” (Watch the video below.) But he failed to mention magic ― the central part of his performance. In an “Early Release” clip posted by “AGT” on Monday, the element of surprise boosted the buoyant German’s illusion act. The 19-year-old made his backup dancers appear out of seemingly nowhere ― to panelist Klum’s song “Chai Tea with Heidi.” Judge Howie Mandel was confused at first. Simon Cowell flashed a few of his signature smirks during the performance, but ultimately gave it a Simon-esque thumbs-up. “Fantastically good and fantastically bad at the same time,” he said. “Horrendous, but it kinda worked.” Find out Holste’s fate right here: General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

(Watch the video below.) Hayes, the “Will and Grace” alum, showed a clip of Biden’s accident Saturday near his beach home in Delaware and snarked: “You know they’re just loving this at Fox News. Tucker Carlson has been going around the office dry-humping all the furniture.” Fast-forward to 3:50: Carlson, who has attempted to cast the president as feeble, did comment on the mishap Monday. “We’re not attacking Joe Biden for falling off his bike at a dead standstill,” the prime time cable TV star said. “He’s at the age where that can happen. He shouldn’t be riding bikes. He also shouldn’t be president.” Carlson then accused Biden’s staff of lying about his “physical and mental state for years.” Fast-forward to 16:08: General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

15,Bradley Cooper Fumes Over Director Who Dissed His Oscar Nominations At A Party,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost “Maestro” star Bradley Cooper said he never forgets an insult ― and one jogged his memory on a recent “SmartLess” podcast. (Check it out below.) Co-host Will Arnett mentioned that Cooper now has nine Oscar nominations. That reminded the movie star of a nasty encounter he had with a director at a Hollywood party a few years ago. The director, Cooper recalled, asked him how many nominations he had. The “A Star Is Born” filmmaker had seven at the time and told him so. Cooper said the nameless director replied: “What world are we living in where you have seven nominations?” “I remember, ‘I fucking hate this business,’” Cooper continued. “I’ll never forget it. I’m looking at him and I’m like, ‘Bro, why are you such an asshole? Go fuck yourself.’” Cooper has collected two other best-picture nominations since for co-producing “Nightmare Alley,” which he starred in, and “Joker.” When he got his first nomination, for best actor in 2012’s “Silver Linings Playbook,” he remembered being at another party hosted by the same talent agency. He said he met a prominent actress who disdainfully referred to Cooper’s honor as the “nom.” It got weirder. Fast-forward to 25:25: General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Rob Kardashian And Blac Chyna Settle Before Trial's Sequel,entertainment," LOS ANGELES (AP) — A settlement agreement has been reached on the eve of a second trial pitting the Kardashian family against former reality TV star Blac Chyna. Jury selection had been set to begin Monday in the trial over Chyna's allegations that her former fiance Rob Kardashian maliciously posted nude photos of her in 2017 after their tumultuous breakup, but according to court documents, the parties informed the judge that they had agreed to a settlement. Emails to attorneys for both sides seeking comment and details on the terms of the settlement were not immediately returned. A trial had seemed a virtual certainty after the judge last week denied a motion by Kardashian's attorneys to enforce a settlement agreement they said the two sides had reached. The trial was to be a sequel of sorts to a defamation trial earlier this year in which Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian's mother and sisters — Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner — had defamed her as violent and unstable, and persuaded producers and executives to cancel her reality show, “Rob & Chyna.” The Kardashians won a clear-cut victory in that trial May 2. The four women had attended most of the proceedings, and all four testified, though they were in New York at the Met Gala when the verdict was read. Rob Kardashian, who has a daughter with Chyna, was not a defendant in that trial, but he gave often angry and sometimes sad testimony about the late-night fight that led to the end of their relationship. Chyna had initially filed one lawsuit against the whole family, but the judge ruled that the allegations against Rob — which also included assault accusations — should get their own trial. Fewer members of the famous family had been expected to attend the second trial, and only Rob and Kris Kardashian had been expected to testify. At the first trial, jurors found that the Kardashians acted in bad faith in their conversations about the couple's troubles with producers of “Rob & Chyna” and executives from the E! network, which aired it. But they found that it had no substantial effect on Chyna’s contract or the fate of the show, and she was awarded no damages. Chyna’s attorney Lynne Ciani said after the verdict that she and her client were disappointed but felt vindicated by the jury's findings, which she said demonstrated that Chyna had not physically abused Rob, and validated their claim that the Kardashian women had attempted to interfere with her contract to be on the show. ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton"
1,How The Tribeca Film Festival Underscored The Resilience of Filmmaking,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter This year’s Tribeca Film Festival was, as they say, an embarrassment of riches. Incorporating films and TV series from across the world, and spanning many genres and formats, it ultimately underscored the resilience of filmmaking even during times of turmoil. From a soul-altering pregnancy experience to the origin story of techno music and a young girl’s spiritual odyssey told through animation, these narratives were the highlights at the festival. “Liquor Store Dreams” Those alive amid the 1992 Los Angeles uprising might recall seeing myriad images of Korean proprietors, some who were armed, standing on the roofs of their buildings as businesses around them burst into flames. It’s a narrative that, still to this day, isn’t treated with nearly the amount of nuance as it deserves. But documentarian So Yun Um takes a humanistic approach to detailing the complicated, and at times tragic, stories of the Korean liquor store owners and their first-generation children — like herself — struggling to be seen. And while doing so, Um takes on the difficult task of exploring the fraught evolution of Black-Korean relations in LA. “Huesera” There’s definitely no shortage of horror screen narratives that hinge on the terror of motherhood, from “Rosemary’s Baby” to this year’s “The Baby.” But writer-director Michelle Garza Cevera, with co-writer Abia Castillo, explores the well-worn concept with an entirely original Mexican film that is ultimately about a pregnant woman (Natalia Solián) who discovers her path to motherhood comes at grave costs. Most terrifying is her sense of self. “My Love Affair With Marriage” With the success of last year’s “Flee,” which shattered all expectations of both animation and documentary, filmmakers seem to be taking even more chances that are paying off in dividends. With “My Love Affair with Marriage,” Latvian filmmaker Signe Baumane explores the effects of human condition in this remarkable coming-of-age story that tests the bounds of fiction as it traces a girl’s 23-year journey to achieve love and romantic partnership. Throughout the process, the film asks its protagonist, and to some extent the audience, to understand the intricacies of why she’s on this quest in the first place — for herself or to satisfy certain expectations of her. “Pink Moon” A routine meal at the dinner table throws one family into tense discussions about deciding one’s own mortality when a father (Johan Leysen) with no known health issues announces to his adult children that his next birthday will be his last in this surprisingly earnest Dutch film. Director Floor van der Meulen, with screenwriter Bastiaan Kroeger, delicately balances drama with pitch dark comedy in a story that ponders the notion of self-determined fate and the lives, chiefly daughter Iris (a fantastic Julia Akkermans), that it impacts. “Official Competition” Neither Penélope Cruz nor Antonio Banderas are strangers to starring in quirky films like “Vanilla Sky” or “I’m So Excited.” But directors Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat, with co-writer Andrés Duprat, challenge the pair in a whole new way in a film essentially about the narcissistic nature of filmmaking. Cruz is an off-the-wall director who pushes her actors, played by Banderas and Oscar Martínez, to go deep into the narrative by any means (sometimes even by sacrificing their own prized possessions). Hilarity ensues. “Family Dinner” Especially after “Fresh” earlier this year, horror fans might anticipate, and maybe even be eager for, a film that engages in the many complexities of carnal pleasure. But trust, you will not expect what happens in Austrian filmmaker Peter Hengl’s “Family Dinner,” which takes a sweet premise like a girl (Nina Katlein) visiting her aunt (Pia Hierzegger), whom she looks up to, and her new family unit and turns it into a mounting nightmare. “Butterfly in the Sky” If you’re an elder millennial, chances are you grew up on a healthy diet of “Reading Rainbow” with host LeVar Burton. In fact, just the mere mention of the title of this PBS educational series, which ran from 1983 to 2006, probably stirs memories of its iconic theme song. Directors Bradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb engage with that nostalgia in this documentary that chronicles why the series was a success and made Burton an icon of scholarship, the racial and social barriers it broke, and why it was a tragedy when it lost its funding. “God Said Give ’Em Drum Machines” Even if you’re not part of the techno fandom, you’ll get something out of this documentary, directed by Kristian R. Hill, that puts credit for the music genre back into the hands of Black DJs and musicians in Detroit. This story doesn’t so much ask whether or why it was co-opted by white recording artists, though it does give that question the thought it deserves. Rather, how these young Black men created the music and found each other as well as a largely queer Black club community in the process. “The Right to Offend: The Black Comedy Revolution” We’re living during a time when it seems like every day a stand-up comedian is getting canceled or assaulted, whether that is verbally or physically, for the words they speak. So it seems like an interesting time to reflect on the ways particularly Black comics throughout history have never backed down from statements considered controversial to the public — from Moms Mabley and Dick Gregory to Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. Directors Jessica Sherif and Mario Diaz trace the complexity of the punchline in this timely docuseries. “A League of Their Own” Admittedly, the mere idea of yet another TV series adapted from a classic film in this saturated climate is eye-roll-worthy. But showrunner Will Graham’s thoughtful exploration of the beloved female baseball players at the center of this story incorporates multiple queer characters and characters of color that help ground the humanity of both the time period, the narrative and the sport. It doesn’t take away from the original 1992 film, but it’s a nice companion piece. “Menudo: Forever Young” From the title alone, you might want to file this under another docuseries reflecting on one of your favorite nostalgic bands. But “Menudo: Forever Young” goes farther than that as directors Angel Manuel Soto and Kristofer Ríos grapple with the iconic boy band’s impact on their Puerto Rican community, the exploitative nature of their industry and the horrible debt they paid.

2,Katelina Eccleston Is Giving Black Latinas In Reggaeton Their Flowers,entertainment," Culture Reporter This profile is part of our Culture Shifters series, which highlights people who are changing the way we think about the world around us. Read about film archivist Maya Cade, internet star Keyon Elkins, rapper Latashá, filmmaker Alika Tengan and artist Kay Rufai. Music historian Katelina Eccleston has always loved reggaeton. “I have home videos [of me] dancing to El General at 3 years old in a puffy yellow dress and black shoes,” Eccleston said, referring to the legendary Panamanian reggaeton artist. “I was born into listening to reggae en español and reggaeton by El General.” Raised by Panamanian parents in Boston, Eccleston is a proud Black Latina. That pride in her heritage and love for reggaeton inspired Eccleston to give Afro-Latinas the spotlight they deserve. The historian and artist is the founder of Reggaeton Con La Gata, the first femme brand and platform dedicated to the intersectional analysis and history of reggaeton. In addition to its biweekly newsletter, the brand’s official Twitter account @ReggaetonXGata spotlights Black Latinas in Reggaeton — such as La Zista, Glory “La Gata Gangster,” Amara La Negra, and more — through curated playlists, roundups of music industry news and conversations between Eccleston, artists and music experts. Created in Eccleston’s college dorm room, Reggaeton Con La Gata has been featured in Harper’s Bazaar, Remezcla, NPR and other outlets. She’s given guest lectures at Harvard University and produced the Spotify podcast “Loud: the History of Reggaeton.” Eccleston is a lead researcher on MTV and Paramount’s forthcoming show “De La Calle.” The docuseries is hosted by Nick Barili and explores the “evolution of Urbano music and cultures that ignited the musical revolution of Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Bachata, Latin trap, Cumbia, and other sounds,” according to Deadline. Eccelston’s musical acumen and upbringing is shaped by a fusion of cultures. She spent her Sundays in an African American Baptist church, where she learned how to play the piano. She attended West Indian Carnival and Dominican parties where the sound of bachata beats reverberated through the walls. “I feel like throughout all of that, one thing that has always mattered to me was the music,” Eccleston said. At age 11 or 12, she remembers making the conscious decision to “choose reggaeton.” However, listening to the genre was initially off-limits for Eccleston, whose mother categorized reggaeton in the same box as painting her nails and other “grown folk” activities. ”I remember going to a quinces and dancing reggaeton with a family friend, and my mom’s like, ‘You don’t dance reggaeton because that’s for older people,’” she said. “When a religious mother tells you you can’t have something, you just want it all the more.” What was once off-limits to Eccleston has catalyzed her legacy. “I have home videos [of me] dancing to El General at 3 years old in a puffy yellow dress and black shoes. I was born into listening to reggae en español and reggaeton by El General.” “My obsession with music has always been infectious in my social situations,” Eccleston said. But that pride in her heritage has at times been complicated by anti-Blackness within her communities. The 27-year-old “comunicadora social” recalled pressures as a kid from people outside of her family to conform to “Latinidad” — a term that loosely translates to Latino-ness and the attributes of a shared Latino identity — because she is darker-skinned. She said that, fortunately, her immediate family has always been very pro-Black and has raised her to disregard comments such as “pelo malo,” made in reference to kinky or coily Black hair. “To paint a very specific picture,” said Eccleston, recounting her childhood, “in the third grade, my own peers would ask me, ‘Are you sitting at the Black table or the Spanish table?’ It’s funny because at the Spanish table, they’re all Black Latinos. I would consciously choose not to sit at either, so I was so alone.” Growing up in very segregated Boston, which has a prominent Dominican population, Eccleston and her cousins were often the only Panamanians in social settings. For her, home was not only a safe haven, but a venue to share music. In the days of Limewire and iPods, crowds of classmates would show up on Eccleston’s doorstep, demanding that she host the next party. But when her father died by suicide when she was 12, her energy shifted. “I was the most depressed teenager,” Eccleston said. “I had the emo haircut. You could not get me to stop wearing skulls, studded belts, Jordans. Around 18, I was like, ‘You know what? I’m alive. He’s not. I have to live my life. I don’t want to be sad anymore.’ I made the conscious decision to forgive him, forgive myself for wasting my own time, being sad and being mean to myself.” With a new lease on life, she sought to expand her horizons and pursued college in the Big Apple. In 2012, she started at the Pratt Institute, but the joys of freshman year were curtailed by a traumatic sexual assault. Music is what saved her, she said. “I’m a moody listener. I’ll go from Flyleaf and Three Days Grace to the nastiest reggaeton and back to Jay-Z, then back to the nastiest reggaeton,” laughed Eccleston. “I feel like it’s the sexiest genre that’s out there. There’s a lot of intelligence that comes from it — when you take apart all of the misogyny — the intention behind it and its process. I have a profound respect for it.” In 2016, she transferred to Marymount Manhattan College to study communication and media arts, with the goal of becoming the next Ilia Calderon, a well-known Colombian journalist. Then it dawned on her: Eccleston didn’t want the pressure of being “the next” anything. She asked herself, what if I did my own thing? “This is coming on senior year where we had to present our capstones. I was like, has anyone ever studied reggaeton? That’s when I found the work of Marisol LeBrón, Wayne Marshall and people who’ve done it before me,” Eccleston said. “It hit me at that moment that people don’t know Panamanians’ contributions on a larger scale. I’m like, ‘Oh, people don’t know my history. There’s no bridge between academia and entertainment? No? What the heck! Why isn’t this a thing?’” Following her capstone thesis and presentation, Eccleston knew she had so much more to say — and Reggaeton Con La Gata was born. As a tween softball player, her friends gave her the nickname “Gata,” which translates to “cat” (short for Katelina). So she infused it into the brand’s name. After graduation, Eccleston worked at Dick’s Sporting Goods by day. At night, she’d move from venue to venue, interviewing artists at local nightclubs. Her online following blew up when cultural critic Zahira Kelly retweeted her after they met. “She was like, ‘Make a video. Talk about reggaeton history!’” recalled Eccleston. “[Zahira] had like 30,000 followers. She’s like, ‘I’m gonna retweet you and you’re gonna see!’ I wake up the next day, and I have thousands of retweets.” While building comunidad through Reggaeton Con La Gata, Eccleston, a longtime lover of poetry, sought to create her own music. With an EP on the way, she said that her “audacity” to take the leap stemmed from the fact that in the music industry, Black Latinas are written out of their own stories. According to Eccleston’s research, less than 10% of reggaeton performers are Black Latinas. “[Reggaeton] was a medium of resistance. Sure, it got fun, but it was first used to spread messages. That’s in the spirit of this music, to stand for something. I say reggaeton is a daughter of hip hop, and there’s different objectives.” Too often popular artists contribute to the erasure of Black Latinos in the genre. Case in point: For Paper magazine, Eccleston spoke to J. Balvin about his self-acclaimed status as an ambassador of “the culture.” In the interview, he said he “didn’t have Latinos in mind” when making his hit song “In Da Getto.” “The purpose of this song was to showcase the Projects as a main element of ‘El Movimiento,’” Balvin said in the article. Eccleston noted that the “track highlights the issue of Black Latinos being spoken for without consideration of their plight.” By centering himself at the reggaeton movement’s core, Balvin is effectively ignoring the Black Latino predecessors who made his ascent possible, Eccleston said. She said it’s a bone that many Black Latinos have to pick with him. (Last year, the issue came more into focus when he was named Afro-Latino Artist of the Year by the African Entertainment Awards, despite not being Afro Latino. The award name was later changed to Best Latin Artist of the year. Moreover, in 2021, J. Balvin had to apologize for depicting Black women as dogs on leashes in the music video for his single “Perra.”) Due to Latinidad’s connection to white supremacy, said Eccleston, she often finds herself exasperated trying to explain the implications of being a Black individual in hyperwhite environments, such as the Latin music industry. Eccleston said this is largely due to the fact that many white Latino artists and community members fail to understand the power they wield in the industry. “Yes, I love this music, but on a personal and professional note, what I want is for people to pause and think about what we’re doing to each other,” Eccleston said about how erasure of Black Latino contributions to music. “If they’re backed by institutions, for example, which a lot of these artists and the teams are, they have the ability to enact violence on others if they don’t recognize what their power is or that they have it. They don’t even know what that means.” Eccleston noted that the barriers to entry for Afro-Latino performers differ greatly across gender. Rattling off male musicians such as Sech, Zion y Lennox, O.G. Black, Yaga y Mackie and others, she pointed out the vast disparity between the number of Black men compared to Black women in reggaeton. Eccleston said “there’s no sort of advocacy for Black women,” citing singer Amara La Negra as an example of what often happens to Black Latinas in music. Amara La Negra, who broke through on VH1’s “Love & Hip-Hop: Miami,” has talked about anti-Blackness and colorism in Latino communities and the music business. “People were tired of hearing about racism, about problems they couldn’t relate to. Over time, there’s this sort of tokenization that happens,” said Eccleston. “For her to share that she was homeless? I absolutely believe it. Because wouldn’t that be me if I went off on that as well? That’s how extreme it is. People can be like ‘we hear you,’ and not not give a damn if you have a place to sleep.” Eccleston added that for female artists and listeners, navigating the difference between gratuitous sexuality and sexual empowerment in reggaeton is akin to walking a tightrope. A part of the issue, she added, is some people can’t fathom women, especially Black women, claiming power through sex positivity. As a former sex worker, Eccleston hopes people grasp that reggaeton is not only about sex, but about liberation. “[Reggaeton] was a medium of resistance. Sure, it got fun, but it was first used to spread messages. That’s in the spirit of this music, to stand for something,” Eccleston said. “I say reggaeton is a daughter of hip-hop, and there’s different objectives. The mission might be to own sexuality or to have fun.” Through Reggaeton Con La Gata, Eccleston hopes to advance and continue the genre’s legacy. “Quite frankly, there’s a mission [with Reggaeton con La Gata] in regards to owning its authenticity and its Blackness, whichever way it may present itself because there’s a policing as to what type of Blackness is acceptable,” Eccleston said. “With my platform, I hope to just be a space where you can recognize all these different things in bite-sized pieces.” Culture Reporter"
3,Stephen Colbert Addresses His Team’s Arrest By U.S. Capitol Police: ‘Just Doing Their Job’,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert on Monday addressed the arrest of his production crew by U.S. Capitol Police last week and joked that they were guilty of “puppetry in the first degree.” Seven members of the “Late Night” team were arrested in the Longworth House Office Building Thursday night and charged with unlawful entry. CBS said the production team was recording a comedy segment featuring Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and had filmed authorized and pre-arranged interviews with members of Congress. The network said the team was detained while filming stand-ups and other elements in the halls after their last interview of the day. Robert Smigel, who provides the voice for the toy dog, was among those arrested. “The Capitol Police are much more cautious than they were, say, 18 months ago. And for a very good reason. If you don’t know what that reason is, I know what news network you watch,” Colbert said on Monday. “The Capitol Police were just doing their job. My staff was just doing their job. Everyone was very professional. Everyone was very calm. My staffers were detained, processed and released.” While it was a “very unpleasant experience” for his staff, Colbert said it was all a fairly simple story ― until a certain TV personality falsely declared “Late Night” staff had “committed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building.” (Colbert didn’t mention him by name, but those words were spoken by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night.) “First of all, what? Second of all, huh? Third of all, they weren’t in the Capitol building. Fourth of all ― and I am shocked I have to explain the difference ― but an insurrection involves disrupting the lawful actions of Congress and howling for the blood of elected leaders all to prevent the peaceful transfer of power,” Colbert said. “This was first degree puppetry. This was hijinks with intent to goof. Misappropriation of an old Conan bit.” Watch his full explanation below: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one.

6,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Filmmaker Alika Tengan Is Giving Native Hawaiians A Bigger Spotlight,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost This profile is part of our Culture Shifters series, which highlights people who are changing the way we think about the world around us. Read about film archivist Maya Cade, internet star Keyon Elkins, rapper Latashá, music historian Katelina Eccleston and artist Kay Rufai. Alika Tengan was itching to make something in 2020, after a film he was hoping to shoot that year was sidelined because of the pandemic. That fall, his friend, freelance journalist Naz Kawakami, told him some big news: He was planning to move to New York in early 2021. The two decided it would be interesting to make a movie about leaving home, and the idea for “Every Day in Kaimukī” was born. That dilemma of whether to leave the familiar and take a leap into the unknown is a tale as old as time. But as Tengan explained over Zoom, “that conversation is especially interesting in the backdrop of Hawaii,” where both of them were born and raised. “Because he’s a mixed Native Hawaiian guy like myself — he’s Japanese and Native Hawaiian — we had similar perspectives on feeling Hawaiian but not Hawaiian enough, Japanese but not Japanese enough. I think we related a lot in that way. And he has also lived here his whole life, and so moving for him was a big deal, as it is for many of us in Hawaii,” Tengan said. “I think being Hawaiian and not feeling Hawaiian enough can give you a rootlessness, and it makes the decision to leave easier in some ways, and more complicated in some ways too.” They initially discussed making a documentary, but then decided to dramatize some elements “just to make it a little more compelling or interesting,” such as adding some composite characters and having Kawakami play a more heightened version of himself. The film’s cast is a mix of trained actors and Kawakami’s real friends. “Every Day in Kaimukī” premiered in the Next category at this year’s Sundance Film Festival in January, the first Native Hawaiian feature-length film to premiere at Sundance. It’s a heartfelt slice-of-life portrait imbued with a sense of place and identity — while not solely being about that. The movie evokes many classic genres and familiar experiences. Among other things, it’s a “hangout” movie, a “deciding whether to leave home” movie and a “being a 20-something person figuring out adulthood” movie — that happens to center a Native Hawaiian protagonist. There are moments of humor, especially in Naz dealing with the logistical nightmares of moving, like selling his stuff on Craigslist and getting stuck on multiple phone calls with his airline to confirm he can safely bring his cat on the long flight. He’s also trying to savor his final moments with his friends and pastimes, like skateboarding and being a late-night DJ at the community radio station. “It’s really accurate to living in Hawaii and our experiences and our actual relationships and the way that being Asian, being Hawaiian, being mixed is so endemic to our everyday, as to not even be a part of the conversation,” Tengan said. “It just is.” For independent filmmakers, a Sundance premiere has long been a huge career moment. Tengan had been excited to head to the snowy peaks of Park City, Utah. But sadly, the omicron surge forced the festival to go completely virtual for the second year in a row. “That was tough. I still don’t know if I’ve gotten over it, the big pivot, but it is what it is,” he said. Thankfully, he has been able to take the film to several in-person festivals this spring, such as the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and the Center for Asian American Media’s CAAMFest in San Francisco, where it was the closing-night film. He also hopes to find a streaming home for it so that it can be seen more widely. Tengan, 34, is proud to be part of a growing wave of Native Hawaiian filmmakers. Historically, a lot of Hawaii’s film industry has been driven by outside productions filming there, he said. But over the last few years, he has been happy to see more interest in and financial support for local talent. “I think there’s an incredible wave of local Hawaiian filmmakers that are about to just be coming up over the next couple of years. And it’s a really exciting time for all that,” he said. “The more that we share our stories that are just specific to our experiences growing up here, it’s generating more interest in those types of stories as well. So there’s more support, more money — it’s this reciprocal thing.” It’s something he’s been trying to do throughout his career. Born and raised in Kaneohe, on the east side of the island of Oahu, Tengan studied film at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. His first film professor, a groundbreaking Māori filmmaker named Merata Mita, “exposed us to Indigenous cinema. I hadn’t been studying art house films my whole life. It took me a while to get into that world. So the concept of indigenous cinema was very new to me,” he said. Mita, an early supporter of director Taika Waititi, showed Tengan’s class Waititi’s Oscar-nominated short “Two Cars, One Night,” which hugely influenced Tengan. Another one of Tengan’s professors, Lisette Flanary, who plays a small role in “Every Day in Kaimukī,” invited Waititi to speak to her class in 2010, the year his breakthrough film “Boy” premiered. “That was also another huge moment for me, to see this Polynesian filmmaker talking about this film that was so specific to where he grew up, but also so charming and funny and light and all of these other things,” Tengan said. “And I wanted to do that for Hawaii. I felt we could do that here because we have a richness of character and story. So that’s what I’ve been wanting to do ever since.” When he graduated in 2013, he wasn’t sure exactly how to get into the film business. Adding to his uncertainty, he was gravely injured in a car accident, which sidelined him for several years. “I did a lot of intense soul-searching, I think, during that time. Because even when I was in film school, I was like, ‘Am I cut out for this?’ and trying to figure out where I fit into the filmmaking ecosystem. Was I going to be an editor, or a writer, or a DP, or director? I had a lot of uncertainty in film school, and then the accident happened. So there was a lot of repurposing and reconfiguring what I wanted out of life.” When he felt ready to get back into filmmaking, a friend told him that HBO’s annual short film contest for emerging Asian American and Pacific Islander filmmakers was taking submissions. “It was a really good prompt for me to be like, ‘OK, let’s try to make something,’ because deadlines are everything,” Tengan said. Tengan pulled out a script he had written back in film school, “Keep You Float,” and called up an old classmate, Jonah Okano. The two co-directed the short in 2016, shooting it in one day. It started a theme in Tengan’s career: deadlines, scrappiness, and working with his friends. The short, about a group of friends deciding where to scatter their late friend’s ashes, was accepted into a local festival, the ’Ohina Short Film Showcase. Tengan and other participating filmmakers got to attend a writers workshop, led by “Black Panther” co-writer Joe Robert Cole. Tengan’s work impressed Cole, who went on to advise him on his next short film, “Mauka to Makai,” which Tengan wrote and shot in 2018. “Joe was amazing. It had happened right before ‘Black Panther’ was coming out. And I didn’t think he’d be available at all because he’d be one of the busiest people in the world. But he still really made time to help me and go over the script with me and gave really thoughtful notes. And we’re still in touch. He’s a wonderful guy.” In March 2019, “Mauka to Makai” played at the Māoriland Film Festival, a major Indigenous film festival in New Zealand. That was another formative experience for Tengan. During the festival, his roommate was a fellow Hawaiian artist, cinematographer Chapin Hall, who went on to shoot “Every Day in Kaimukī.” The two bonded and decided they wanted to work together. “Chapin was like, ‘I have my camera gear with me, and I’m going to be in Hawaii for about a week before I have to fly back to LA for a job,’” Tengan said. “If I could write something in a week, he was down to shoot it. And again, deadlines are everything. So I was like, ‘OK, great. Let’s try to do something.’” Tengan wrote what became “Moloka’i Bound.” It came together quickly, in part because it starred Holden Mandrial-Santos, the star of “Mauka to Makai,” who is also Tengan’s roommate and friend. The two attended the same high school and had similar upbringings, which helped Mandrial-Santos convey what Tengan was looking for in a star for his films. In another personal connection, they shot “Moloka’i Bound” on the steps of Tengan’s old elementary school. “Moloka’i Bound” won the award for best live-action short film at the 2019 ImagineNATIVE Film Festival in Toronto, which qualified it for Oscar consideration. (It’s available to stream on The Criterion Channel.) Tengan had written the short, which consists of just one scene, intending it as “a jumping-off point, proof-of-concept type of thing” for a feature film. With the success of the short, he wrote the script for the feature, which was selected for the 2020 Indigenous List, an offshoot of the Black List, the annual list of the best unproduced screenplays. By early 2020, the wheels were in motion to potentially start shooting the feature version of “Moloka’i Bound.” But the pandemic upended those plans. Tengan found himself spinning his wheels, until he and Kawakami, whom he met a few years prior when Kawakami interviewed him for a story about the local film scene, started talking about their potential project. Once again, another deadline motivated Tengan to make the film. “After we both agreed that we wanted to do this, I had gone to his house, and I took my phone out and I recorded a voice memo. And I was just like, ‘Tell me everything that led up to this moment for you to make this decision,’” Tengan said. “We had that meeting around Thanksgiving in 2020. And because he mentioned that he was going to move in basically February or March, there was already a built-in ticking clock.” While continuing to bring “Every Day in Kaimukī” to more festivals and find a distributor for it, Tengan is back to work on “Moloka’i Bound,” for which he was awarded a $500,000 grant from Ava DuVernay’s company Array and Google. He aims to shoot the film later this year, with Mandrial-Santos reprising his role. Once again, Tengan wants to cast a mix of professional and nonprofessional actors, which he says gives his films “a really interesting alchemy.” “I really love working with nonactors, especially for these types of films, because I think they bring something ineffable to the screen and something that’s really hard to cast for, because these roles are so specific.” Now with more support and a bigger profile, Tengan admits to feeling a bit of pressure. “It’s the most ambitious thing I’ve ever done, so it’s scary. It’s scary and nerve-wracking. And I’m also used to, I think, making things under the radar. So this probably won’t be under the radar, to an extent. And I’m trying to manage my expectations or feelings about that. I’ve never had expectations before. I hope that we can live up to them.” Adding to that pressure is his mission to keep supporting the growth of more Native Hawaiian filmmakers. “I’m super grateful to be in this position because we worked really hard to get here. A lot of people were a part of that, and I just want to justify people’s faith in what we’re doing. I don’t want to waste people’s time, because people have been really supportive. The local film community is so supportive. And so yeah, it needs to be good for them — for everybody.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Kay Rufai Has Created A Safe Space For Black Boy Joy,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter This profile is part of our Culture Shifters series, which highlights people who are changing the way we think about the world around us. Read about film archivist Maya Cade, internet star Keyon Elkins, rapper Latashá, music historian Katelina Eccleston and filmmaker Alika Tengan. It’s around 8 p.m. in London, though you couldn’t tell it’s that late on a February evening by looking at artist Kay Rufai. He pops onto our Zoom call with such a wave of positive energy — sporting a lime green shirt with a matching hat, a gold chain necklace and a megawatt smile — that you might assume it’s more like high noon where he is. “It’s been a good day,” he said, settling into a self-made soundproof booth in his home. “It’s been a busy day, but a good day.” An indication of how Rufai, 38, spends his stuffed weekdays is perched right behind him in the cubicle: a row of images of Black and brown boys grinning from ear to ear. “They’re ever-present,” he said pleasantly. He is referring to his groundbreaking S.M.I.L.E-ING Boys Project, a photographic well-being initiative specifically designed for Black and brown boys in the Swinging City who are often reduced to dehumanizing stereotypes with no concern for their mental health. Rufai’s ongoing research-led project helps boys access their joy and other aspects of their interior selves around which they often put up boundaries. Their guardedness is typically a defense mechanism against a city that, even amid today’s cultural reckoning, largely skirts around issues of race, particularly when it comes to the police. “For example, situations around violence, especially youth violence, is very racialized in the way it’s reported,” Rufai said. “But when there’s anything that’s speaking on the experiences of Black people, or people of minoritized or global majority groups, people get very uncomfortable.” Some of the words used to refer to Black and brown boys in the media, he says, “are so nondescript.” That language bunches kids together with no care for who they are as individuals. It particularly dismays Rufai because he grew up in some of the same neighborhoods where these boys live, in the same circumstances as many of them. He has also worked with young people who have been in and out of prison or in gangs. “I knew that these are not deterrents,” he said. “We know what the recidivism rates are. I wanted to create a project that was rooted in centering the mental health disproportionalities,” since “no doubt violence is a manifestation of that.” It becomes clear that this is a cause close to Rufai’s heart. “Aggressive behavior, or all these other things that are perceived as aggressive behavior or dangerous behavior,” he said. “All these other things were manifestations of lack of mental health provisions for this demographic.” The S.M.I.L.E-ING Boys Project ― the acronym stands for Send Me Inspiring Loving Energy ― creates a safe space for boys to be their full selves, opening up dialogues around topics like aesthetics, money, health and masculinity. Ultimately, the idea is to empower the boys to walk confidently in their truths each day. Rufai captures that sense of freedom by the end of this eight-week process, when the boys’ smiling faces practically beam out of his photographs. But first, he has to meet them where they are psychologically and emotionally ― typically in a school setting ― and establish a mutual trust. “So, I walk into a classroom with 13-year-old boys, and I let them know that your voice is equally as valid as mine,” he explained. “You don’t have to respect me because I’m older. You just have to respect me because you command respect and therefore you give the same to me.” Once Rufai establishes this level playing field, the boys begin to behave in ways that feel more comfortable to them at this stage — whether that means throwing in a swear word here and there, expressing fear, sadness or anger, or vocalizing a thought that was previously difficult for them to share. The one caveat: Rufai can challenge them on what they say and encourage them to think more deeply about things, even if the subject is him. “Around the third session, I ask them what they really thought about me when I first stepped into the room wearing all these bright clothes,” Rufai recalled. “And a lot of the times they say, ‘I thought you were gay. I thought you was, whatever.’ I’m not going to be offended by it.” Instead, he empowers them to explain how they came to that perspective: “I’m just really interested in what you thought. ‘We thought you were so non-masculine because you wore yellow, pink and all of this.’ We start to unpack that.” Rufai’s own youth is part of why he’s made it his life’s work to embolden Black boys to use their voices to unlock who they really are, regardless of what they believe or have been told to believe about themselves. A son of Nigerian immigrants, the artist, born with the first name Adekunle, was always taught two things: Go to university, and become a doctor. “Make your life worth living,” he said. To be fair, Rufai tried that route. He took some coursework and was on a path to study medicine. But by the third year, he became frustrated and restless. “I didn’t want to study that,” he recalled. “I absolutely hated being in the university.” He channeled that agitation into his then-untapped creative side. “While I was there, I spent a lot more time writing and expressing myself,” he said. “I would just escape. Even though [I was] in the physical confines of a lecture hall, I would mentally and emotionally and spiritually be elsewhere, writing and creating.” This allowed Rufai to tap into, and eventually nurture, his artistic passions like poetry, photography and music. But it also meant he would have to dive into some of his own vulnerabilities that he protected from the world around him. These included growing up without his father and navigating life as a Black boy and young man. It wasn’t until later in life that Rufai realized he was using these outlets as his own path toward mental health, and “as a tool to help process some of the complex emotions that I had,” he said. “Because I was very aware of the range of emotions that I was navigating through, but I didn’t actually have language for most of it.” But he found himself more and more drawn to these artistic expressions as he continued to experience life ― primarily in London, but also in Nigeria and the United States. It gave him something he felt he was missing for a long time. “I really gravitated to music,” he said. “It kind of filled that void. I listened to voices of people like Lauryn Hill and Tupac [Shakur], who were significant staples for me growing up in terms of understanding myself and my identity as a Black kid and really navigating those expressions.” You could describe what came later for Rufai as double-edged. He dropped out of university to begin performing and honing his art, which filled him with unbridled joy. But that shift was met with his mother’s disapproval, which he says made it “a very tough period.” Still, betting on himself ended up being an invaluable move for him, and for so many others like him. Because when Rufai, restless once again, decided that he wanted his art to engage with Black boys like him on a more intimate level, he gave them permission to actively and intentionally seek their own happiness with initiatives like the S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys Project. “I created this project because the 13-year-old version of myself needed it,” Rufai said. He admits that looking after his mental health is still a conscious effort on his part each day. Since he hasn’t been able to travel as much as he’d like in the pandemic, he’s relied on walking along the river near his home and turning on some music and dancing in the living room. “I’m moonwalking and just being full of joy in my physical being and my body,” he laughed. “I really just enjoy listening to music that brings joy to my soul. Knowing that a lot of the work that I do is outwardly exerting, I recognize that I have to feed this so that I can be of service.” Still, being in a classroom with boys, seeing them begin to open up, remains his most significant source of joy — one that took him much soul-searching to accomplish, and one that has gifted him with other cultural initiatives around London in addition to his own self-fulfillment. “This work that I do is a radical reinstatement of joy in my life,” Rufai beams. “Curating a space of Black boys that look like me and like each other, for them to be playful, fun. For me to get to be a kid again — because I’m there jumping on chairs, and we play games together.” He pauses, before adding proudly: “We speak openly. We bond. That brings so much joy to me.” Senior Culture Reporter"

13,Seth Meyers Pinpoints Red Flag That Showed Jan. 6 Plan Was 'Truly F**king Insane',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost You know your plan is “truly fucking crazy” when even Rudy Giuliani thinks it’s a bad idea, according to “Late Night” host Seth Meyers. In its third of six hearings, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack painted a picture last week of how John Eastman, a lawyer for Donald Trump, helped the then-president craft a plan to overturn the 2020 election by using Vice President Mike Pence. The committee played testimony from Eric Herschmann, a lawyer and former senior adviser to Trump, who said he received a call on the morning of Jan. 6 from Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney at the time. Herschmann said Giuliani ultimately conceded that Pence probably didn’t have the authority to do what Trump and Eastman were suggesting. “It’s incredible to me that even Rudy knew it was a crazy and bad idea,” Meyers said Monday. “Rudy. That’s how you know your plan is truly fucking insane. This is a guy who, while under multiple investigations, thought it was good idea to do a video using an Abraham Lincoln filter. That same guy looked at John Eastman’s plan and said, ‘I don’t know.’” After Pence refused to comply, a mob of Trump’s supporters laid siege to the Capitol, with some chanting for him to be hung. At one point, the crowd of rioters were within 40 feet of Pence inside the Capitol. Check out more of Meyers’ roast below: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

15,Scandal-Plagued Actor Makes First Red Carpet Appearance In Years,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Lori Loughlin returned to the red carpet for the first time in years on Saturday at a benefit in Los Angeles. Loughlin, the former “Full House” star who served time in prison for a college admissions bribery scandal and has kept mostly a low profile since, had cameras clicking at the DesignCare 2022 Gala to benefit the HollyRod Foundation for families affected by autism and Parkinson’s disease. Loughlin wore a long-sleeved blue dress for the occasion, her first “red carpet” walk (on what appears to be a purple carpet this time) since the scandal broke in March 2019, People reported. In March 2019, Loughlin and designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were arrested for attempting to game the higher-education admissions process. The two paid $500,000 to a fixer to have their daughters, Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Rose Giannulli, accepted to the University of Southern California as crew athletes, even though neither participated in the sport. Loughlin served nearly two months in prison, gaining release in December 2020. Giannulli completed a longer sentence. Loughlin made her return to television in a “When Calls the Heart” spinoff last December on GAC Family. She reportedly attended “Full House” co-star Bob Saget’s private funeral in January and appeared on Instagram Live earlier this month to promote Netflix’s Comedy Store tribute to the late comedian, TMZ noted. One of Loughlin’s last red carpet appearances before the nationwide sting snared her, fellow actor Felicity Huffman and other prominent parents participating in admissions bribery, was with her daughters at a Women’s Cancer Research Fund event in February 2019 in Beverly Hills.

0,"BTS Break Sparks Debate On Activism, Military Exemptions",entertainment," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The surprise announcement by BTS last week that they were taking a break to focus on members’ solo projects stunned their global fanbase, shaking their label’s stock price and leaving many questions about the K-pop supergroup’s future. HYBE, the company behind the band, denied the group was taking a hiatus — a word used in a translation of the group’s emotional dinnertime video announcement. In the days since, band members have remained active on social media, continuing the stream of posts, photos and assurances that the band wasn’t breaking up. Despite the immediate impacts — HYBE’s stock initially dropped more than 25% and has yet to fully recover — several factors may still affect BTS’ future. One is looming military enlistment for older BTS members, as well as how engaged the group and their devoted fans, known as ARMY, will continue to be in social issues. In 2020, at the height of BTS’ success, the South Korean government revised the country’s military law that requires able-bodied South Korean men to perform approximately two years of military service. The revised law allows top K-pop stars — including Jin, the oldest member of BTS — to defer their military service until they turn 30 if they’ve received government medals for heightening the country’s cultural reputation and apply for the postponement. All BTS members meet the criteria as recipients of government medals in 2018. “Obviously, there’s a looming military enlistment so they might have thought it’d be good to do something individually before it’s too late and that’s why I think military enlistment was the biggest factor,” said Lee Dong Yeun, a professor at Korea National University of Arts. There have been calls — including from South Korea’s former culture minister — for an exemption for BTS because of their contribution to heightening South Korea’s international reputation. But critics say that such an exemption would be bending the conscription rules to favor the privileged. Jin, 29, is expected to enlist this year unless he receives an exemption. Military enlistment of members has always been a headache for HYBE; BTS once accounted for 90% of the label’s profit. Currently, the group makes up 50%-60% of the label’s profit according to a report from eBest Investment & Securities. The eBest report noted that the rapid stock plunge might have resulted from an “anticipation that the activities as the whole group might be uncertain after being discharged from the military.” HYBE has been attempting to diversify its portfolio by debuting new K-pop bands, making online games, and rolling out Korean language tutorials. As the most successful K-pop band to date with hits like “Dynamite” and “Butter,” BTS has for years commanded tremendous attention on social media and with each new music release. They recently performed several sold-out shows in the United States, became the first K-pop act to get a Grammy Award nomination, released an anthology album, “Proof,” and channeled their global influence with an address at the United Nations and a trip to the White House to campaign against hate crimes directed at Asians. “Once you achieve success like BTS achieved success, then it means there’s a constant expectation to continue doing something that is connected to what you’ve already done, where you’ve already been. In the most recent releases that BTS has brought out, also we can see how they continually reflect back on where they have been,” said CedarBough Saeji, professor of Korean and East Asian Studies at Pusan National University. She said Tuesday’s announcement signaled the band’s intention to figure out “where they are going for themselves without interference from other people” and “being able to choose their own path forward as artists.” Last week’s announcement also leaves in doubt the group’s social justice efforts, which have included vocal support for the Black Lives Matter movement and anti-violence campaigns. BTS’ legions of fans have embraced the causes, matching a $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter after George Floyd’s death. But the group has faced mushrooming questions about why it isn’t as vocal about discrimination in their own country. A leading South Korean newspaper recently published a column in which the author mused why South Korea, despite having BTS — “the ambassador of anti-discrimination and human rights” — has struggled to enact an anti-discrimination law for 15 years. “It’s an irony,” the writer said. “South Korea needs their force for good.” The country’s lack of an anti-discrimination law has led to unfair treatment against women and foreigners, among others. Jumin Lee, the author of the book “Why Anti-Discrimination Law?” told the Associated Press that there’s a dire need for the anti-discrimination law in the country. “South Korea is in essentially the same situation legally as America’s Jim Crow South. Equal protection exists as a constitutional concept, but there is no implementing legislation that allows the government to force private businesses to comply,” Lee said. “What that means in practice is that if I’m a business owner, I could post a sign on my door tomorrow that says ‘no gays’ ‘no blacks’ or ‘no old people,’ and absent extraordinary intervention by the Constitutional Court, there’s very little the law can do to stop me.” Lee recently expressed disappointment in the band for not speaking up about the important domestic issue. “BTS and their business folks know that speaking up in the US is profitable but doing the same back home would be more trouble than it’s worth. So they don’t,” tweeted Lee after the band’s visit to Washington. Despite that, Lee said the band’s silence is understandable, stating that BTS would be met with “indifference at best and hostility at worst” from politicians if they did speak up. Some South Korean celebrities like singers Harisu and Ha:tfelt have been speaking out on touchy subjects such as the anti-discrimination law and feminism, despite backlashes. After speaking out about the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, which killed 304 people in one of the country’s worst disasters, Cannes-winning actor Song Kang-ho and director Park Chan-wook were blacklisted by the administration of the ousted President Park Geun-hye, noted Areum Jeong, a scholar of Korean pop culture. “So, although many idols might be politically conscious, they might choose not to discuss social issues,” Jeong said. Several BTS members said during last week’s announcement that they were struggling with the group’s successes and having trouble writing new songs. “For me, it was like the group BTS was within my grasp until ‘On’ and ‘Dynamite,’ but after ‘Butter’ and ‘Permission to Dance,’ I didn’t know what kind of group we were anymore,” member RM said. “Whenever I write lyrics and songs, it’s really important what kind of story and message I want to give out but it was like that was gone now.” While that clouds what BTS’ next steps might be, Saeji said their continued candor was necessary because of how much the group has impacted their fanbase. “They’re meeting the fans with that same honesty and saying to them, ‘You had my help when I needed it. And now I need my help,’” she said. “‘I need to be on my own. To think for myself, to know what I want to write a lyric about, to understand my own mind, to become inspired on my own.’”"
1,John Oliver Calls Out Greedy Landlords In Report On Skyrocketing Rents,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost John Oliver on Sunday pointed out that housing is now “the thing a 16-year-old TikTok millionaire can afford and you can’t.” (Watch the video below.) On “Last Week Tonight” the host took aim at skyrocketing rents and some of the greedy attitudes behind them. He noted that the average monthly rent was at an all-time high and that there wasn’t a single county in the nation where a minimum wage worker can afford to rent a “modest 2-bedroom home.” Landlords who blamed “market rate” for raising rents didn’t get a pass from Oliver. He showed a clip of Dave Ramsey, a personal finance personality, assuring a guilt-ridden landlord that raising rent to the market rate “doesn’t make me a bad Christian.” “I did not displace the person out of that house if they can no longer afford it. The marketplace did,” Ramsey said on “The Ramsey Show.” “Of course kicking someone out of your house doesn’t make you a bad Christian,” Oliver said. “It’s in the Beatitudes: ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Fucked are the poor in money. For theirs is the kingdom of landlords. Wazzaaaaaaa!!’” Then there was footage of Bob Nicolls of Monarch Investment and Management Group gushing over the “unprecedented opportunity” to “press rents.” “Where are people gonna go? They can’t go anywhere,” he reasoned. Oliver accused the firm of treating people like paninis. See what he meant: General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Kate Hudson Honors Kurt Russell For Father's Day And His Response Is Too Sweet,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Celebrity dads, they’re just like ours: communicating via social media the best they know how. On Sunday, Kate Hudson shared a sweet Father’s Day tribute with her followers to Kurt Russell, her mother Goldie Hawn’s longtime love. “Fun, adventurous, passionate, determined, honest, devoted, amazing father and the best head of hair in Los Angeles,” she wrote alongside a throwback photo of her cuddling in bed with Russell. “Lucky us! Love you Pa! Happy Fathers Day.” Hudson was raised by her mother and Russell, Hawn’s partner for nearly 40 years, as the “Almost Famous” star is estranged from her biological father, musician Bill Hudson. Since Russell has no social media presence of his own, Hawn passed along her daughter’s message, before publicly sharing his heartfelt response in the comments for all to see. A post shared by Comments By Celebs (@commentsbycelebs) “Honey I showed this to daddy. Here’s his message…” Hawn wrote. “Birdie, mommy just showed me this picture, this is perfect Father’s Day present. I’ve never seen it before. Wow..it’s a killer,” Russell wrote. “Lotta water under the bridge…it’s kinda hard to see it though cause all the water seems to somehow have found its way into my eyes…thanks for making me the luckiest father in the world sweetheart. I love you, Pa.” Hawn also posted a special shoutout to Russell on Instagram alongside a photo of the two stars sharing a kiss. “How can I explain the gratitude and love I feel for the greatest father who has given us all so much in this life,” she captioned the photo. A post shared by Goldie Hawn (@goldiehawn) Hudson and her brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were born to Bill Hudson and Hawn during the couple’s marriage, which lasted from 1976 to 1982, but both consider Russell to be their father. Hawn and Russell share son, “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” star Wyatt Russell, together. The “Escape from New York” actor is also father to son Boston from a previous marriage to Season Hubley. Throughout the years, Hudson has repeatedly gushed about Russell’s pivotal role in her life, calling him a “great loyal protector” and “our dependable authentic captain” in a Father’s Day post last year. But the estrangement from her biological father still weighs heavily on the star. “I have a great family, I have a beautiful mother. I have a stepfather who stepped in and played a huge, huge part in sharing what it is to have a dependable father figure in our life,” she said in an episode of “Sunday Today with Willie Geist” last year. “But it doesn’t take away from the fact that we didn’t know our dad,” she continued, describing the fracture as a “41-year-old issue” that lingers to this day. “People sometimes just need to hear that they’re not alone in that.” For Father’s Day, Hudson shared an additional tribute to her partner Danny Fujikawa on Instagram, posting a video of him with their 3-year-old daughter Rani. Just like her parents, Hudson has a blended family of her own. She is also a mom to son Ryder, 18, whom she shares with ex-husband, musician Chris Robinson, and son Bingham, 10, from a previous relationship with Muse frontman Matt Bellamy.

3,‘Lost’ Star Matthew Fox Reveals Why He Retired From Acting,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost We have to go back ... to set. Perhaps the most tantalizing mystery “Lost” ever spun had nothing to do with hatches, polar bears or even smoke monsters, but what happened to star Matthew Fox. The actor went onto appear in a handful of films, including “World War Z,” and “Extinction,” before leaving Hollywood altogether after his presumed final onscreen role in the horror western “Bone Tomahawk.” Ahead of his return to television in Peacock’s upcoming apocalyptic series “Last Light,” Fox addressed the longstanding speculation about why he pressed pause on his acting career. “I’ve just spent seven years living my life with my family and pursuing things that I’m passionate about,” the actor said about his self-imposed retirement from acting, per Variety. “But storytelling is in my DNA in some way, and I felt like this form of storytelling was something that I wanted to reengage with, and see how it felt. And I’m really happy that I did so ― it’s been good.” Fox explained that he chose to walk away from the industry after checking off all the items on his bucket list, which included starring in a western film. “After I did [the movie] ‘Bone Tomahawk’ in 2014 that had kind of completed the bucket list,” he said. The 55-year-old star, who shares two children with his wife Margherita Ronchialso, said that he also chose to prioritize family time over movie roles. “At that time in my life, our kids were at an age where I felt like I needed to really reengage,” he continued. “I had been focused on work for some time, and [my wife] Margherita had been running the family so beautifully, but I felt like it was time to be home, and I really felt like I was retiring from the business, and working on other creative elements that are really personal to me — some music and writing.” The opportunity to both star in and executive produce a project drew Fox back to his first television role since “Lost” ended over a decade ago. Based on the novel by Alex Scarrow of the same, “Last Light” is a five-episode drama series following “a family fighting to survive in a world that has been suddenly thrown into chaos,” as the world’s oil supply is abruptly cut off. The series also reunites Fox with director Dennie Gordon, who worked with the actor on “Party of Five,” which initially launched his career. “I kind of got to a point where I thought that maybe the bucket list included executive producing,” he said. “I’d never done that before.” Since his days starring as Dr. Jack Shepard, Fox has faced a number of setbacks in his personal life, including a DUI arrest and allegations that he punched a female bus driver. He denied her claims and charges were never filed with the driver later withdrawing her lawsuit against him. But an incendiary tweet from Fox’s “Lost” co-star Dominic Monaghan, who claimed that the actor “beats women” only compounded the negative press surrounding him at the time. Fox later blasted Monaghan’s allegations as a “pile of bullshit,” remarking in 2012 that it’s “been a long, trying year of sitting on my hands on a lot of negative shit said about me.” “They’re the furthest things from who I am,” he told Men’s Fitness about the accusations. “In the 46 years I’ve been breathing on this planet, I have never hit a woman before. Never have, never will.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Maybelle Blair, 95, was among the members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, a professional women’s baseball league which existed from 1943 to 1954. The California native pitched for the Peoria Redwings in 1948. The women’s league became immortalized by Hollywood in the 1992 film “A League of Their Own,” starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna. The movie is also the basis for a new Amazon Prime series of the same, created by Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City” and Will Graham. Blair ― also known as “All The Way Mae,” like Madonna’s character in the original movie — came out as a lesbian while speaking after a screening of the new series at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York this week. “I think it’s a great opportunity for these young girl ball players to come to realize that they’re not alone, and you don’t have to hide,” Blair told the audience. “I hid for 75, 85 years and this is actually basically the first time I’ve ever come out.” After Monday’s screening, Amazon Prime shared footage of the emotional moment on the official “League of Their Own” Twitter and Instagram accounts. For the majority of her life, sports legend 95-year old @AAGPBL player, Maybelle Blair felt like she had to hide her authentic self. Today she came out publicly for the first time. We couldn't be happier for her, and continue to push for love and acceptance on and off the field. pic.twitter.com/BEaCisO2RH Like the 1992 movie, “A League of Their Own” takes place in 1943 and follows fictionalized members of the Rockford Peaches. According to press notes, the series diverges from the film by taking “a deeper look at race and sexuality, following the journey of a whole new ensemble of characters as they carve their own paths towards the field, both in the league and outside of it.” A teaser for the show released earlier this month hints at a flirtation between players Carson (played by Jacobson) and Greta (D’Arcy Carden). Appearing on “The Drew Barrymore Show” last year, Jacobson confirmed that she’d sought the blessing of Penny Marshall, who directed the movie and died in 2018, before committing to the series. She also vowed that the show will explore “the realities of what was really going on in 1943” while evoking “the spirit and the joy” of the original. “A door opens for a lot of white women and white-passing women that get on the league that we all know from the film,” she said. “But what about the Black women who were not allowed to try out and who had to sort of carve their own path to play baseball? It’s also a really queer story.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
11,"Lauren Graham, Peter Krause Announce Split After More Than 10 Years Together",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Actors Lauren Graham and Peter Krause have announced that they split up last year after more than a decade together. Graham’s rep confirmed the breakup to People.com, saying the “Gilmore Girls” star and “Six Feet Under” star “quietly ended their relationship last year.” The couple had a long history as friends before romance bloomed, having met while on the set of the NBC sitcom “Caroline in the City” in 1995. But they didn’t actually start dating until 2010, when they played brother and sister on the NBC series “Parenthood.” Graham told reporters back in 2010 that the relationship was “so fun” and “so easy,” but said timing and shyness kept them from connecting when they met in the 1990s. “I think we liked each other [but] he asked me over to his house to play a board game ― and that’s exactly what we ended up doing,” she said. “So I was like, ‘This guy doesn’t like me. Who actually plays a board game?’ The timing wasn’t right. I don t think either of us was ready.” The relationship may have been frayed by COVID-19 concerns, based on what Graham told Ellen DeGeneres back in April 2021. At the time, she was working on the Disney+ series “The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,” which was shot in Vancouver. “Normally that’s a two-hour flight and you come home on the weekends, but I couldn’t do that. So we were separated for almost five months, which had never happened before,” she told the talk show host. When she did finally come home, Graham noticed “more piles” around the house and that Krause and his son from a previous marriage had “really bonded.” She said the bonding “was fantastic,” but that it left her feeling like the odd man out. “Like, it was more that they were the married couple,” she said. You can see Graham discuss her relationship with Krause in this 2016 HuffPost Live interview below. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Miles Teller Belts 'Great Balls Of Fire' In Previously Unseen 'Top Gun: Maverick' Clip,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Miles Teller is a supporting actor to Tom Cruise in most of “Top Gun: Maverick,” but he’s the star of the show in a previously unseen extended scene from the popular movie. The clip, released Thursday, shows the full-length version of Teller performing the Jerry Lee Lewis classic “Great Balls of Fire,” which was also heard in the 1986 original. Actors often use body doubles in scenes where their character plays a musical instrument, since not every actor has musical training. But Teller insisted on actually playing and singing the song himself for the scene. Teller said he told producers: “I played piano when I was younger. I still dabble a little bit. I don’t need a double, I will play and sing this live,” according to CinemaBlend. But when he started to practice the song for the scene, he admits he wondered if he’d bitten off more than he could chew, because “it’s a pretty hard song” and Lewis “sings pretty high.” Still, it was probably easier than the flight training he went through for his role as Rooster. Teller told Seth Meyers earlier this week that he broke out in hives during the shoot. He said doctors found “flame retardant, pesticides and jet fuel” in his bloodstream. Later, when Teller informed Cruise that he had jet fuel literally coursing through his veins, the veteran actor didn’t seem shocked. “Yeah, I was born with it, kid,” Cruise told Teller, which Teller said “was a very Tom moment” for him. You can hear Teller sing ― and play ― “Great Balls of Fire” in the video below. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

14,‘9-1-1: Lone Star’ Actor Tyler Sanders Dead At 18,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Tyler Sanders, a young actor who was most recently featured in the Fox series “9-1-1: Lone Star” and was just nominated for a major award, died Thursday, his representative confirmed to HuffPost. The cause of death is unclear and it is currently being investigated. He was 18. “Tyler was a talented actor with a bright future.

15,Pete Davidson Asks Kim K If Audio Person Has Seen Her Vagina More Than Him,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Pete Davidson didn’t appear onscreen for “The Kardashians” all season, but he still provided raunchy laughs on Thursday’s last episode. In a post-credit scene shared by Us Weekly, Kim Kardashian introduced Davidson to her longtime sound person and noted: “She knows everything about me. She’s probably seen my vagina.” “More than me?” the “Saturday Night Live” alum said off-camera. “Not more than you,” Kardashian replied. “But she’s probably seen it.” The audio tech said she’s never seen Kardashian’s privates, prompting mock surprise from the reality star. “We’ll get there,” Kim K said. “Takes time to warm up to seeing my vagina. But you could look on the internet.” Davidson and the reality queen began dating after Kardashian’s guest host gig on “SNL” in October. She said recently she was lured in at first by Davidson’s “BDE.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

0,'Diary Of A Wimpy Kid' Actor Who Killed Mother Also Targeted Justin Trudeau: Court,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Canadian actor Ryan Grantham, who has appeared on “Riverdale” and the 2010 film version of “Diary of a Wimpy Kid,” pleaded guilty to killing his mother in March — but now comes word he also allegedly plotted to kill Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well. That revelation came during the sentencing hearing for the 24-year-old Grantham, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder earlier this year. According to the CBC, Grantham shot 64-year-old Barbara Waite in the back of the head in March 2020 while she was playing the piano. During a hearing on Monday, the court heard how the actor rehearsed the killing beforehand and filmed a video afterwards where he confessed to the murder and showed his mother’s corpse on camera. The day after the murder, officials said Grantham packed a car with guns, ammunition, 12 Molotov cocktails and camping supplies and hit the road with the intention of killing the prime minister. His reason for doing so wasn’t made clear at the hearing. However, when he got to Hope, B.C., he turned around, drove to Vancouver police headquarters and told police, “I killed my mum,” according to Complex. Grantham also mentioned his plan to kill Trudeau in a statement to police and in an excerpt from his private journal that was read in court. Two psychiatric reports presented at the hearing showed that Grantham was suffering clinical depression in the months leading up to the murder and had experienced urges to commit violence and kill himself, escalating feelings of self-hatred and guilt over his mother possibly learning he had stopped attending classes at college, according to the CBC. The reports also said he had a cannabis use disorder. If convicted, Grantham faces an automatic life sentence, but Canadian prosecutors are asking for 17 to 18 years of parole ineligibility. In Canada, people convicted of second-degree murder are typically eligible for parole in anywhere from 10 to 25 years. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Ana De Armas Channels Iconic Marilyn Monroe Moments In First Trailer For 'Blonde',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Ana de Armas may not wear an actual dress of Marilyn Monroe’s in “Blonde,” but she does a good job of filling her shoes. That’s based on the first trailer for the upcoming Netflix biopic about the iconic sex symbol, released on Thursday. The “official teaser” shows de Armas channeling some of Monroe’s most famous moments, including her rendition of “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” from “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” However, de Armas is not seen singing “Happy Birthday” to John F. Kennedy. The film’s synopsis describes it as a bold reimagination of the life of “one of Hollywood’s most enduring icons,” from a volatile childhood as Norma Jeane Mortenson, through her rise to stardom and romantic entanglements. De Armas told Netflix Queue that director Andrew Dominik told her he wanted the world “to experience what it actually felt like to not only be Marilyn, but also Norma Jeane.” She added, “I found that to be the most daring, unapologetic, and feminist take on her story that I had ever seen.” The film is based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel of the same name. De Armas said she prepared for the role by studying “hundreds of photographs, videos, audio recordings, films — anything I could get my hands on.” Every scene in the film is inspired by an existing photograph, and de Armas said she and Dominik would pore over every detail in each photo and debate what was happening in it. “The first question was always, ‘What was Norma Jeane feeling here?’ We wanted to tell the human side of her story. Fame is what made Marilyn the most visible person in the world, but it also made Norma the most invisible.” The NC-17 film debuts on the streaming platform Sept. 23, and Dominik told Vulture that it has “something in it to offend everyone.” You can see the trailer below.

2,Tom Hanks Doesn’t Think He Could Star In Oscar-Winning ‘Philadelphia’ Today,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Tom Hanks is reflecting on his role in the critically acclaimed film “Philadelphia.” Hanks, who scored an Oscar after starring in the 1993 movie as Andrew Beckett, a gay man with AIDS, said that if the production were created today, a straight actor wouldn’t be cast in that role. “Rightly so,” he added. In an interview this week with The New York Times’ David Marchese to promote the new Elvis Presley biopic, Hanks looked back on his part in the groundbreaking film. He called both “Philadelphia” and “Forrest Gump” (1994) “timely movies, at the time, that you might not be able to make now.” “Philadelphia” was the first major studio film to face the AIDS crisis head-on. It portrays the struggles and eventual death of Hanks’ character as he battles discrimination after contracting AIDS. Hanks agreed with Marchese that a heterosexual actor couldn’t be cast in the nearly 30-year-old film anymore. “Let’s address ‘Could a straight man do what I did in ‘Philadelphia’ now?’” Hanks said. “No, and rightly so.” “The whole point of Philadelphia was don’t be afraid. One of the reasons people weren’t afraid of that movie is that I was playing a gay man,” Hanks said. “We’re beyond that now, and I don’t think people would accept the inauthenticity of a straight guy playing a gay guy,” he added. “It’s not a crime, it’s not boohoo, that someone would say we are going to demand more of a movie in the modern realm of authenticity.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Kelly Clarkson Responds to Britney Spears’ Criticism Of Her By Covering ‘Womanizer’,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Kelly Clarkson seems to have nothing but love for Britney Spears. The former “American Idol” winner performed a cover of Spears’ 2008 single “Womanizer” during the “Kellyoke” segment on her talk show Wednesday (see the video below). The cover — captioned “Celebrating Queen Britney” when “The Kelly Clarkson Show” tweeted a video of it Wednesday — appears to be a response to Spears criticizing Clarkson in a now-deleted caption on Instagram. Last week, Spears posted a video with a caption presumably targeting Clarkson for making insensitive comments about her mental state during a 2008 interview with an Atlanta radio show. “Don’t you just wish she would say she’s kidding ???” Spears wrote in the caption, according to screenshots circulating on social media. “Clarkson … in a world where bullying has been heartbreaking, I’ve had my share.” Spears publicly displayed a series of troubling behavior in 2007 and was placed under conservatorship in 2008. In the short clip from that year, Clarkson wonders out loud if her fellow pop star’s strange behavior at the time is just a joke. “Man, but wouldn’t it be funny if she’s just totally screwing with everyone?” Clarkson says in the clip. “Cause it’d be real funny if she were like, ‘Just kidding!’ I mean, think about it.” Britney Spears CALLS OUT Kelly Clarkson for saying this about her in 2007 pic.twitter.com/z3ziK56Fzt Clarkson added: “She’s done no press for her album [Blackout], which I love by the way. She’s done no press, just gets so much press off all this other stuff.” Although the quotes in the clip don’t look particularly great for Clarkson, a full video of the conversation adds a bit more context. In the 2008 interview, the hosts of the radio show frequently call Spears “crazy” and make fun of her use of a mysterious British accent while speaking to paparazzi. Although Clarkson seems to be politely engaging in the conversation, she does appear to be trying to steer it in another direction. At one point, in which a host calls Spears “pure crazy,” Clarkson defends her. “I met her a couple of times, she’s actually really super cool to me,” Clarkson says. When the hosts play a clip of Spears talking in the fake British accent, Clarkson attempts to find an explanation for the behavior. “OK, so sometimes when I drink, I have accents,” she says. “Is she drinking?” “I don’t know, but she’s on a lot of medication,” says one host. “Britney’s high on life,” another host says. “Hey, well, don’t knock it ’til you try it,” Clarkson says. When a host asks Clarkson what kinds of accents she does when she drinks, she seems uncomfortable and replies: “I don’t know, I was just trying to be nice.” As the hosts all laugh, Clarkson seems to take the opportunity to change the subject. “I get a thicker Texan accent,” Clarkson says. The conversation from there on out is all about how Clarkson sounds when she’s drunk and cursing around children. Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Tony Siragusa, Former NFL Star, Dead At 55",entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Stephen Colbert Has A Message For The Proud Boy Who Name-Dropped Him In Court,entertainment,"  Stephen Colbert has a message for the leader of the Proud Boys, the street gang indicted for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, who name-dropped him in court. During his monologue on Wednesday, “The Late Show” host said Joseph Biggs referenced “negative press and media coverage” ― such as coverage by Colbert ― in his request to move his trial away from Washington, D.C. Biggs is facing up to 20 years in prison for seditious conspiracy in connection with the Jan. 6 attack. Colbert, who jokingly became emotional, implied he was overwhelmed that a “violent fascist” made him feel seen despite his jokes. After referencing a Newsweek story on his show’s name-drop in court, Colbert had a message for Biggs that he also wanted a potential jury pool to hear. “You are going to jail you neo-numbnut, and if you don’t like it, you can come and get me. My name is Joe Scarborough and I love coffee. Welcome to the monkey house, brother,” he said. Watch Colbert’s full monologue below: "
11,"Kim Kardashian Left Marilyn Monroe Dress In 'Heartbreaking' State, Expert Says",entertainment,"  A costume display expert said Marilyn Monroe’s iconic 1962 dress has been “completely altered” and lost its “magic moment” after Kim Kardashian wore it to the Met Gala in May. Kardashian and the dress’s owner, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, have been under fire after recently surfaced pictures revealed alleged damage to the dress. Monroe wore the dress ― fitted with 2,500 rhinestones on a nude-colored fabric ― to President John F. Kennedy’s 45th birthday celebration, where she famously sang a sultry rendition of “Happy Birthday.” ChadMichael Morrisette, a visual artist who regularly helps handle and display costumes, said he spotted the damage on a recent visit to Ripley’s Believe It or Not in Los Angeles. He later shared images of what he spotted with the Marilyn Monroe Collection. “I know the dress very well, I’ve seen it many times, I’ve photographed it many times, I have plenty of photographic evidence of what’s different now,” Morrisette, a Monroe fan, told HuffPost. A post shared by The Marilyn Monroe Collection (@marilynmonroecollection) The dress was designed to be skin-tight on Monroe’s body, he said. The dress’s patches and panels have been pulled to the point of being “bubbled, ripped” and “tattered,” according to the expert. There are also a number of missing crystal beads, he said. He said he’s curious why Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour and others at the event allowed Kardashian to wear the dress, which he said is the most expensive dress in the world. HuffPost reached out to Kardashian, the Met Gala and Ripley’s for comment. Back in 2016, Morrisette said he curated an exhibition that put thousands of Monroe’s personal items on display ― including the dress ― for Julien’s Auctions. He said he staged and created “a museum” for people to view the “Some Like It Hot” actor’s history in 2016. “I got to put this dress forth to the public and treat it respect and dignity and awe,” Morrisette said. Ripley’s bought the dress that night for $4.8 million. A number of internet users have weighed in on a video taken of Kardashian in the dress prior to the Met Gala and believe it to be evidence of an already “ruined” dress, Buzzfeed News reported. Those worries don’t hold up for Morrisette, however, who said Kardashian already tried on the dress in Calabasas prior to the video. “That [damage] is because of her. She already tried to squeeze it up her body, and she decided to lose 16 pounds” to wear it, he said. “And the fact that it’s hanging on a wooden hanger [in the video] is outrageous. That is not how you treat a garment that has that weight, those crystals and that delicacy, it’s unbelievable that it’s not being laid flat.” Morrisette, in an Instagram post earlier this week, wrote that the dress is a “piece” of his life and described its current state as heartbreaking to him. A post shared by ChadMichaelChristianMorrisette (@1morrisette) Kardashian looked “stunning” in the replica dress, he said, but he’s unsure what she can do in response to the original dress’s current state other than “take accountability.” “But it doesn’t change the reality of what happened... that this dress is completely altered,” Morrisette said. “It doesn’t have that magic moment anymore.” "
12,"Brad Pitt Tells Gwyneth Paltrow, 'I Do Love You,' More Than 20 Years After Their Split",entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt’s relationship may not have ended in marriage, but the two still share a deep mutual respect for each other. From 1994 to 1997, the Oscar winners and “Se7en” co-stars were among Hollywood’s most-buzzed-about celebrity couples. In a recent Q&A-style interview for Paltrow’s wellness and lifestyle site, Goop, the pair look back on their long-defunct romance and brief engagement with no regrets. At one point in the interview, Paltrow shares how her late father, Bruce Paltrow, felt as though he were “gaining a son” while she and Pitt were planning to wed “even though we didn’t get married.” Later, the “Shakespeare in Love” actor notes she “finally found the Brad I was supposed to marry,” referring to screenwriter and producer Brad Falchuk, whom she wed in 2018. “It just took me 20 years,” she quips. As for Pitt, he tells Paltrow, “It’s lovely to have you as a friend now,” adding, “And I do love you.” The “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” star also has fond memories of Bruce Paltrow, who died in 2002. “One of the many things I loved about Bruce ― because he did have a profound effect on me and is someone I still think about ― was he really fostered your voice, your independence,” Pitt said. “That man was funny. He was funny. And you guys were so funny together, ripping across the table, which was a rarity that I hadn’t experienced much, and I loved it.” Paltrow and Pitt have each been married twice. From 2003 to 2016, Paltrow was married to Coldplay singer-songwriter Chris Martin, with whom she shares daughter Apple, 18, and son Moses, 16. Pitt was previously married to Jennifer Aniston from 2000 to 2005 and Angelina Jolie from 2014 to 2019. He and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 19; Pax, 17; Zahara, 16; Shiloh, 15; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12. In a 2020 interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Paltrow said she and Pitt were very much on “friendly” terms. “I don’t have any really bad blood,” she added. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Jon Cryer Shares What Charlie Sheen Was Like Before Things Went ‘Off The Rails’,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Before the tiger blood, Charlie Sheen seemed like a pretty cool cat. At least according to Jon Cryer. Cryer and Sheen co-starred on the incredibly successful CBS sitcom “Two and a Half Men” in the early 2000s before Sheen was fired from the show after a string of strange behavior and sparking a public feud with the series’ creator, Chuck Lorre. Cryer told Entertainment Tonight in an interview published Monday that when the show started in 2003, Sheen was a “joy.” “We got along great, he had been sober for two years when we started the show, and it was really important to him to keep sober,” Cryer told the outlet. “And for those first few years, the show was also going so smoothly.” Cryer admitted that he was often “struck by how great Charlie Sheen was at performing in front of an audience.” “He just had it straight out of the box like it was genetically programmed into his body. That was fun and very self-assured,” he said. “For those first couple of years, it was, you know, an incredible joy.” Sheen’s charm paid off — literally. By the time he was fired from the show in 2011, he had become the highest-paid actor on TV, Forbes reported. Cryer told ET that Sheen’s transformation from a charismatic star into full-fledged warlock didn’t happen overnight. Cryer said that despite Sheen relapsing and splitting from his wife, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Denise Richards, in 2005, he “was still lovely to work with,” knew all his lines and showed up to work on time. “But you could tell that there was some trouble brewing,” Cryer said. Cryer described Sheen suddenly having issues with the show’s writing, which Cryer said he couldn’t quite understand. “I would say, ‘This is the kind of joke you had no problem with a year and a half ago, and suddenly now it’s an issue?’” Cryer recalled. “So, you know, it was very subtle. It took a while before it started really going off the rails.” Sheen’s behavior, which included talking disparagingly about Lorre in public, became increasingly erratic. Cryer said this is why he started talking to Lorre about ending the show altogether. “I think there was a moment where Chuck Lorre and I were looking at each other and we said, ‘It’s not worth this show going on if going on enables Charlie Sheen to kill himself. If giving him enough money to do whatever the thing is that ends his life, you know, we don’t want to be a part of that,’” he said. “And I think, actually, when Charlie was let go from the show, the first thought amongst most of us was, ‘OK, we’re done. This has been a great thing, but we’re done at this point.’” The show didn’t end, however. Ashton Kutcher was brought on to replace Sheen, and the series concluded in 2015 after 11 seasons. Ten years after his departure, Sheen said he regretted his behavior. “There [were] 55 different ways for me to handle that situation, and I chose number 56,” he told Yahoo! Entertainment in February 2021. “And so, you know, I think the growth for me post-meltdown or melt forward or melt somewhere — however you want to label it — it has to start with absolute ownership of my role in all of it,” Sheen explained. He added: “And it was desperately juvenile.” Despite feeling remorse for his actions on the show, Sheen hasn’t exactly been “winning” since he left “Two and a Half Men” in 2011. In 2020, actor Corey Feldman accused Sheen of sexually assaulting his friend, the late actor Corey Haim, while the two were working on the 1986 film “Lucas.” Sheen has denied Feldman’s allegations, which were featured in Feldman’s documentary “(My) Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys.” These allegations were not new, however. Sheen sued the National Enquirer for libel in 2017 after the tabloid printed Feldman’s rape allegations. (The parties settled in 2018.) Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Polish Teen Makes A Prophet Of Simon Cowell In Knockout 'AGT' Performance,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Singer Sara James had a lot to live up to on “America’s Got Talent” Tuesday. (Watch the video below.) Before the 13-year-old from Poland performed, judge Simon Cowell told her, “I’ve got a good feeling about you for some reason.” James validated Cowell’s vibe from her first breakout note of Billie Eilish’s “Lovely.” “I’ve heard a lot of singers over the years, but wow,” Cowell said afterward, adding: “You have a real star glow about you.” Cowell pressed the Golden Buzzer to catapult James to the live rounds.

15,Donald Trump Jr.'s New Grift 'Sounds Like A Threat' To Stephen Colbert,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Colbert reckons Donald Trump Jr.’s mail-order meat promotion sounds more frightening than it does appetizing. “Until they face consequences, the ex-president’s family is still out there peddling their wares,” Colbert said on Tuesday night’s “Late Show.” For example, Trump Jr. recently made a post on Instagram promoting Good Ranchers, a MAGA-friendly mail-order meat company. “If you haven’t heard about Good Ranchers before, you need to. They’re one of the only companies out there delivering 100% American meat to your door 100% of the time,” Trump Jr. said in the video, which offered the code “MAGAKING” for two free ribeye steaks. Colbert was a little disturbed by this vow. “One hundred percent of the time, there will be meat at your door. Every time you open it ― Boom! More meat. Like it or not, meat there! You’re gonna have to walk over the meat every time you open your door,” he joked. “That sounds less like a delivery and more like a threat. ‘Hey, snitches get rib tips. All I’m saying is I’d hate to see your wife and kids end up with infinite meat.’” “Given this family’s whole deal, what’s the grift here? Is it gopher meat?” Colbert added. As it turns out, the business saw its Better Business Bureau accreditation revoked last year after it failed to deal with numerous customer complaints “with integrity, good faith and intent to do what is reasonably expected,” among other issues.

0,Steph Curry Defends Wife Ayesha Curry Against Haters With Hilarious Shirt,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Stephen Curry is letting critics know not to mess with his wife. On Monday, the all-star stood up for his wife by wearing a T-shirt that read “Ayesha Curry CAN cook.” Curry sported the endearing shirt during his postgame press conference after the Golden State Warriors conquered the Boston Celtics in Game 5 of the 2022 NBA Finals in San Francisco, California. The NBA star’s eye-catching fashion choice appeared to be a jab at a Boston bar that took shots at the cookbook author by showcasing a sign outside its building last week that said, “Ayesha Curry Cant Cook.” You stay classy Boston pic.twitter.com/ZcIyNVcNNS Game On!, a bar near Fenway Park, also fired off another trolling message about Curry’s family with a displayed sign that read, “Duece Tatum > Riley Curry,” a nod toward the son of Celtics player Jayson Tatum. The incorrectly spelled sign (his name is actually spelled Deuce) said that Tatum’s son was greater than Curry’s daughter. Although Curry made his dislike for the diss clear with his shirt choice, he didn’t have much to add about his fashion statement, allowing the shirt to speak for itself. When a reporter asked him about the meaning behind his top, Curry evaded the question and replied: “You got to ask around the room and ask Twitter.” “Ayesha Curry can cook” 😂😂😂Steph and absolute legend pic.twitter.com/v8RzyLXOKl Ayesha and Stephen Curry have been married for over a decade. The mother of three launched her successful culinary career in 2014. Stephen Curry currently holds three championship titles and multiple MVP awards with the Warriors. The point guard racked up 16 points against Boston in Monday’s victory for the team. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Tom Hanks Defends 'Forrest Gump' Over Controversial Best Picture Oscar Win,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Unlike life, you almost always know what you’re going to get with a Best Picture Oscar winner: a crowd-pleasing movie with an ooey-gooey, message-filled center. Sure, there have been deviations over the years, but for every “Parasite,” there’s a “Green Book,” “Crash,” “Driving Miss Daisy” or yes, “Forrest Gump,” to balance out the scales. Tom Hanks, however, considers his 1994 drama to be an outlier, despite movie fans arguing that either “Pulp Fiction” or “The Shawshank Redemption” were more deserving of the Best Picture win. Speaking with The New York Times in wide-ranging profile published last week, the actor defended the film against critics who only regard it as a “totem of boomer nostalgia.” “The problem with ‘Forrest Gump’ is it made a billion dollars. If we’d just made a successful movie, Bob and I would have been geniuses,” he told the outlet, referring to film director Robert Zemeckis. “But because we made a wildly successful movie, we were diabolical geniuses,” Hanks continued. “Is it a bad problem to have? No, but there’s books of the greatest movies of all time, and “Forrest Gump” doesn’t appear because, oh, it’s this sappy nostalgia fest.” Hanks went on to note that he regularly sees articles that argue Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” should’ve triumphed in the category, conceding that the film is a “masterpiece without a doubt.” But he said “Forrest Gump” should also get its due. “Look, I don’t know, but there is a moment of undeniable heartbreaking humanity in ‘Forrest Gump’ when Gary Sinise — he’s playing Lieutenant Dan — and his Asian wife walk up to our house on the day that Forrest and Jenny get married,” Hanks said, adding that the “magic legs” scene conveys “all they had been through and feel gratitude for every ounce of pain and tragedy that they survived.” “That’s some intangible [expletive] right there,” he continued. “That is not just running along to Duane Eddy’s ‘Rebel Rouser.’” “Forrest Gump” essentially swept the 67th Academy Awards, winning six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Director for Zemeckis and Best Actor for Hanks. Along with “Pulp Fiction” and “The Shawshank Redemption,” the film beat out nominees “Four Weddings and a Funeral” and “Quiz Show” for Best Picture. Tarantino’s boundary pushing, blood-soaked extravaganza, meanwhile, was seen as an experimental underdog by comparison, ultimately only taking home a prize at the ceremony for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Hanks is set to reunite with Zemeckis, who also worked with the actor on “Cast Away,” in Disney’s upcoming live-action version of “Pinocchio.” But first he’s aiming for Oscars glory once again in the upcoming “Elvis” biopic out later this month. For the role of the singer’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, Hanks donned prosthetics and hefty cosmetics, rendering him nearly unrecognizable. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Tyler Perry Reveals Will Smith's State Of Mind Right After Oscars Slap,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Filmmaker Tyler Perry said Monday that Will Smith “couldn’t believe what happened” when Perry approached the actor onstage after he slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars in March. The “Madea” mogul added that he wasn’t comforting the “King Richard” star, even if photos with Denzel Washington might suggest otherwise. “When we walked over to him, he was devastated,” Perry said of Smith at the Tribeca Film Festival, per People. “He couldn’t believe what happened. He couldn’t believe he did it. I’m looking at this man in his eyes going, ‘What are you doing? This is your night.’” In the Directors Series interview, CBS’s Gayle King asked Perry if he was comforting Smith. Perry said he was “deescalating” while making it clear to Smith that what he did was “wrong.” “There’s a difference between comforting and deescalating, that’s No. 1,” he said, according to People. “And I left early to get to Chris to make sure he was OK. Being friends with both of them has been very difficult.” Perry believed the outburst stemmed from Smith’s unresolved issues in being unable to protect his mother as a child, which he wrote about in a book. “I know that feeling of being a man and thinking about the little boy,” Perry said, according to Variety. “And if that trauma is not dealt with right away, as you get older it will show up in the most inappropriate, most horrible time. I know Will. I know him well.” The slap heard around the world is still echoing. Rock, whose “G.I. Jane” crack about Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head prompted Smith’s onstage attack, jokes about the incident during stand-up gigs but has yet to go in depth. Smith apologized and incurred a 10-year suspension from the Oscars. And Pinkett Smith recently asked the two men to reconcile in a statement assuming no culpability on the part of her husband. Vivica A. Fox even called out Pinkett Smith for her lack of accountability. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Seth Meyers Points Out Jared Kushner's Tell In Jan. 6 Testimony,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jared Kushner’s silence was deafening after one particular question posed by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, Seth Meyers said. In its second hearing on Monday, the committee laid out evidence that former President Donald Trump and his inner circle knew his claims of a rigged election were false but pushed them anyway. On the night of the 2020 election, Trump reportedly ignored his campaign advisers and, on the advice of his intoxicated personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, falsely declared victory while votes were still being counted. In one snippet from the testimony, Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former White House adviser, was asked if he’d ever shared his perspectives on Giuliani with Trump. After a long pause, Kushner said he had. Then when asked what he told his father-in-law, he said: “Uh, basically, not the approach I would take if I was you.” “That was a very long pause. You could tell Kushner did not want to answer the question. I’m shocked he didn’t break out into a song called ‘We don’t talk about Rudy,’” Meyers said on “Late Night” Monday. “That’s definitely the length of the pause you take when someone asks you about a friend who was super drunk at a party, especially a friend you invited.” Watch Meyers’ roast below: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes.

9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Jimmy Kimmel Presents 'Drunk Giuliani' Compilation After Jan. 6 Panel's Detail,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost There’s no way late-show hosts weren’t going to pounce on this detail from the Jan. 6 House select committee hearings. Jimmy Kimmel’s team promptly offered up a compilation Monday after the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol revealed that on the night of the 2020 election, Donald Trump falsely declared victory on the advice of his drunk personal attorney, even though votes were still being counted. “President Trump rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night, and instead followed the course recommended by an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani to just claim he won and insist the vote-counting stop, to falsely claim everything was fraudulent,” committee co-chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said at Monday’s proceedings. Cheney’s comments were followed by video testimony from former Trump aide Jason Miller, who said Giuliani was “definitely intoxicated” when they spoke that night. “Everyone pretty much told Trump he lost, but he didn’t want to hear that. He wanted to hear what Rudy Giuliani told him,” Kimmel said. “And how would Trump know Giuliani was drunk? I mean, does this seem like a drunk person to you?” Check out the compilation below on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Matthew Morrison Speaks Out About His Firing From 'So You Think You Can Dance',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Matthew Morrison has offered his own explanation for text correspondence that’s reportedly at the center of his firing as a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance.” A source told People earlier this week that the “Glee” actor was dismissed from the dance competition show for sending a female contestant “flirty” direct messages on social media that she said had made her uncomfortable. Morrison announced his departure last week, saying he had violated “competition production protocols, preventing me from being able to judge the competition fairly.” “It’s really unfortunate that I have to sit here and defend myself and my family against blatantly untrue statements made anonymously, but I have nothing to hide,” Morrison said Thursday in a video posted on Instagram. “So, in the interest of transparency, I will read to you the one message I wrote to a dancer on the show.” According to Morrison, that single message said: “Hey, it’s Matthew. If you don’t mind, would love to get your number and talk you through some things.” “The end,” he said. “I sent this because this dancer and I both share a mutual respect for a choreographer that I’ve known for over 20 years and I was trying to help her get a job as a choreographer on the show.″ “Gossip is toxic,” he added, concluding by saying he didn’t want the incident to take away from the show. He wished the remaining judges and contestants on the show “all the best.” A post shared by Matthew Morrison (@matthewmorrison) A source close to the Fox reality show had told People that Morrison’s conduct was investigated after the woman, who reportedly received multiple messages, alerted producers. Morrison will be replaced as a judge. However, many of the episodes were pre-taped, meaning he will be seen on the show through mid-June. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,'Wildhood' Breaks New Ground As A 2-Spirit Coming-Of-Age Tale,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost A teen learns to embrace his true self after a life-changing road trip in “Wildhood,” which is being screened virtually as part of the NewFest Pride film series this week ahead of its Hulu premiere. Directed by Bretten Hannam, “Wildhood” follows Link (played by Phillip Lewitski), who lives under the eye of his stern, anti-LGBTQ father (Joel Thomas Hynes) in Canada. Link soon discovers that his mother Sarah ― long believed to be dead ― might still be alive. So he and his younger half-brother, Travis (Avery Winters-Anthony), embark on a journey along Canada’s eastern coast to find her, as well as reconnect with their Indigenous roots. After some time on the road, Link finds himself drawn to Pasmay (Joshua Odjick), a young person who is Two-Spirit, meaning they identify as having both a masculine and a feminine spirit. Soon, Link and Pasmay are exchanging longing glances and flirty quips. Whether romance is in the stars for the pair, however, remains to be seen. Catch the trailer for “Wildhood” below. Hannam, who is Two-Spirit and nonbinary, said they began writing the screenplay for “Wildhood” more than a decade ago. In 2019, they released “Wildfire,” a short film based on an abridged version of the script. Though some of the events portrayed were inspired by the filmmaker’s life, the film as a whole reflects the “experiences of a community that I’m part of,” they said, and isn’t intended as a coming-out story. “Two-Spirit identity is an intersection of the relationship to land, gender, sexuality, ceremony, and culture,” Hannam told Salon last year. “It’s hard in English to summarize or speak about those things succinctly. For Link going on this journey, he is finding out where he fits in all of these aspects, and what it means to be part of a community.” “Wildhood” will showcased as part of NewFest Pride, a five-day series of in-person and virtual screenings curated by the organizers of New York’s annual LGBTQ film festival that runs Thursday to June 6. Other highlights of the series include “Fire Island,” starring Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang, and “Girl Picture,” a drama that follows three Finnish women as they explore their sexuality over several weekends. Peacock’s hotly anticipated reboot of the landmark LGBTQ series “Queer as Folk” will also have its New York premiere as part of the event. After the virtual New York engagement, “Wildhood” will debut on Hulu June 24 following a weeklong theatrical run at the Lumiere Music Hall in Beverly Hills, California.

13,Johnny Depp Gave Parenting Tips To Pregnant Bar Manager Before Verdict,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost A bar manager in the United Kingdom shared that she had spoken with actor Johnny Depp just before the verdict was announced in his defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Lauren Whittington, who is the general manager of the Bridge Tavern bar in Newcastle, England, described the encounter on Wednesday to ITV News. “None of us could believe it,” Whittington told the British television network, adding that it took a while for bar-goers to notice the actor. Depp “went unnoticed for maybe an hour before anyone realized it was him and Jeff Beck just [sitting] eating fish and chips together in the corner,” said Whittington. She added that Depp noticed she was pregnant and asked her how long she had left in her pregnancy before offering some parenting tips. “He was giving me some advice on [diapers], lack of sleep and the first few weeks of parenthood, saying it’ll be the greatest gift I ever receive and I won’t know love like it until I look into her eyes for the first time,” Whittington said. “He was also talking about his kids, who are grown up now, and how magical being a parent is,” she added. According to Whittington, Depp departed from the bar “about an hour before the verdict” was announced in court in Fairfax, Virginia. “[He] said he had a Zoom call about [the verdict], so we wished him luck and thanked him for being so kind, and he thanked us for having him,” she said. The jury decided primarily in favor of Depp, awarding the actor $15 million in total damages, however, Heard will only have to pay $10.35 million due to a Virginia law capping punitive damages. Heard was granted $2 million in compensatory damages in her countersuit for a statement by Depp’s attorney that was found to be defamatory. In court filings, Depp had requested $50 million in damages, while Heard countersued for $100 million. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
14,ABC News Gets Flak For Oddly Critical Marion Barber III Death Tweet,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost By most measures, the late Dallas Cowboys running back Marion Barber III had a successful NFL career. He rushed for 4,780 yards and 53 touchdowns, and collected 179 receptions for 1,330 yards and six touchdowns in seven seasons ― the last of which he spent with the Chicago Bears in 2011. But ABC News wrote a curiously negative tweet about the star, who was reportedly found dead in his apartment Wednesday after someone called police to check on his welfare. He was 38. The outlet wrote that Barber “scored plenty of touchdowns without recording a 1,000-yard season.” Barber’s lesser yardage, while mentioned deep in The Associated Press article linked in ABC’s tweet, seemed to be an odd fact to highlight in an obituary headline. ABC News didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday and apparently deleted the tweet. The network’s tweet downright ticked off some fans and sports reporters, who called it insensitive and disrespectful. This is like satire level of bad.

0,U. Of South Carolina Now Home To Boatload Of Hootie & The Blowfish Memorabilia,entertainment," COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Hootie & the Blowfish got its start at the University of South Carolina and the school is now home to a boatload of the Grammy Award winning rock band’s memorabilia. Longtime fan Rick Noble on Friday donated his collection of all things Hootie & the Blowfish — including CDs, ticket stubs, an autographed guitar and T-shirts — to the school where the band was formed in 1986. “The story of Hootie and Blowfish is forever entwined with the University of South Carolina – it’s one of the exciting pieces of our modern history,” Interim President Harris Pastides said in a news release. “Rick’s collection will help capture that story and preserve it for future generations. We are so grateful for his foresight, dedication and generosity in sharing a gift that increases the stature of the University Libraries’ music collections.” Noble, who is now retired from a career in nonprofit work, including as the long-time CEO of Richland County First Steps, said he’s been collecting the band’s memorabilia since 1993, a year before the band released its debut album, “Cracked Rear View.” He said he first became interested in the band after listening to his daughter’s copy of an early album. Then he connected with band members and its management when they performed at a benefit concert Noble organized. “They just started giving me T-shirts and other merchandise,” Noble recalled. “And I just went on from there. It was a treasure hunt.” The band merchandise is the second contemporary music memorabilia collection to come to the University Libraries. A large collection of guitars, photographs and costumes from the rock band KISS was donated in 2020. Libraries Dean Tom McNally said special collections help attract scholars and students to the university and he hopes other collectors and musicians will continue to donate items for display, teaching and research. Library staff is in the process of organizing, appraising and preserving the donated items, which also includes drumsticks, a Hootie candle and golf balls. Once complete, a public viewing will be scheduled. Noble’s donation comes shortly after the University of South Carolina Press released a book about the history of the band, “Only Wanna Be with You: The Inside Story of Hootie & the Blowfish.” “It’s such a special, full-circle moment to see his collection come home to the UofSC library and we couldn’t be more thankful to him for supporting both our band and our university,” Darius Rucker, the band’s lead singer, said."
1,Charlie Puth Says He Regrets How He Lost His Virginity: 'I Never Saw Her Again',entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Music and sex go hand-in-hand for Charlie Puth. The “Light Switch” singer sat down with Bustle for an amusing interview full of TMI moments. While the chat was likely meant to promote his recent hit singles and forthcoming album, “Charlie,” it quickly veered into more, um, physical matters. Puth divulged to the publication that he lost his virginity at age 21 to a fan who had attended one of his early performances in Boston and, from the sounds of it, his first sexual experience wasn’t quite as monumental as he might have hoped. “This girl came up to me and was like, ‘Can you sign my chest?’ I was like, I feel like a rock star,” he said. “I never saw her again. She was lovely, but it makes me sad sometimes because I wish the older version of me was like, ‘Hey, you might want to just make this like a little more memorable.’” Elsewhere in the chat, Puth revealed that the first song he ever “jerked off to” was Maroon 5’s “This Love” ― a point which he says that band’s frontman, Adam Levine, finds “really weird.” Most of the time, however, he can’t listen to music while hitting the sheets. “I will analyze the music playing in the background,” he told Bustle, “and I’ll start to see the music notes in my head and I will not be able to get hard.” Such details probably won’t come as much of a surprise to Puth’s fans, as the four-time Grammy nominee is known for his steamy TikTok videos and Instagram posts, some of which show him in various stages of undress. Last month, he showed a bit of derrière in what appeared to be a behind-the-scenes snapshot from a recent photo shoot. And Puth ― who has previously described “Charlie” as his “most authentic” album to date ― isn’t fazed by the speculation into his personal life that his work as an artist draws. “I’m really horny,” he said. “I think to be a creative, you have to be a little bit.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Alicia Witt Reveals She Began Cancer Treatments When Her Parents Tragically Died,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Alicia Witt is shedding new light on what she was going through during her parents’ sudden death. Just six months after her parents were discovered dead in their Massachusetts home, the “Orange Is the New Black” actor posted a slideshow on Instagram Wednesday that revealed she recently underwent treatment for breast cancer, including chemotherapy and a mastectomy. She also said that she began these treatments when her parents died in December. In the first video in her slideshow, the “Fun” star rings a gong to signify that she has completed chemotherapy. “Just a little over 2 months ago, I had my last round of chemical therapy prior to my mastectomy,” Witt wrote. A post shared by Alicia Witt (@aliciawitty) “Although we didn’t yet know for absolute certain until after the mastectomy that the disease was completely healed from my left breast,” Witt said, this “marked the end” of her treatment with chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and taxotere. She said her treatment with the immunotherapies Herceptin and Perjeta “will continue ... through the end of this year,” citing the treatment protocol for HER2-positive breast cancer. The slideshow also features a photo of her proudly holding up her chemotherapy certificate of completion. The Hallmark holiday movie queen gave a shoutout to her “beloved, brilliant, collaborative, communicative doctor” in the caption of her post. Witt, 46, also wrote that she was surrounded by a “tiny crew of human angels” who kept spirits high throughout her journey. In the slideshow, the “Urban Legend” star is seen wearing a Penguin Cold Cap, a scalp cooling process that is known to minimize hair loss. She emphasized what that cap meant to her, as well. “While keeping hair was obviously the last of my concerns on a larger level, i did deeply wish to keep my diagnosis private until it was 100% healed, god willing,” she wrote. Witt made sure to thank those who “honored” her during her treatment by keeping it private and said that “these caps can truly play a huge role in allowing a patient to reveal her journey on her own time, when she is ready.” “For me, this was such a needed part of my healing ― particularly given the horribly public tragedy that had happened in our family just as i was beginning my treatments.” Witt’s parents, Robert Witt, 87, and Diane Witt, 75, were found dead in their home late last year by police after the actor asked a relative to check on them because she hadn’t heard from them in several days. The cause of their death was “probable cardiac dysrhythmia” due to the cold, according to the death certificates, The Telegram & Gazette reported. Police said at the time the home’s heating system was not working, according to The Associate Press. Witt said in a Facebook post in January that she had repeatedly offered her parents help, but was always turned down. She called her parents “fiercely stubborn” and said she had no idea they were without heat. “Every time I offered to have something repaired for them, they refused to allow workers into their house,” she wrote. “I begged, cried, tried to reason with them, tried to convince them to let me help them move — but every time, they became furious with me, telling me I had no right to tell them how to live their lives and that they had it all under control.” She concluded her post lovingly. “Our last words to each other were ‘I love you,’” she wrote. “That part was simple; never in doubt. They loved me so. I loved them so.” Reporter, HuffPost"

Jordan and Lori Harvey, have closed the curtains on their relationship after dating for more than a year and a half. The model’s father, Steve Harvey, confirmed the breakup on Monday’s episode of “The Steve Harvey Morning Show,” saying he was “Team Lori, 1,000%.” He didn’t offer much in the way of detail of why they ended their relationship, which started in November 2020. Calling Jordan a “cool guy,” the host shared, “I’m pretty sure they’ll be fine. People break up all the time.” Rumors began to surface on Saturday that Jordan and Lori Harvey broke up, and People verified the news the same day. “Michael and Lori are both completely heartbroken,” a source close to the couple told People. “They still love each other.” The source explained, “Michael matured a lot over the course of their relationship and was ready to commit for the long term. He let down his guard with her, opening up emotionally in a romantic relationship for the first time...They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.” A post shared by Michael B. Jordan (@michaelbjordan) The stylish duo officially announced their relationship and became “Instagram official” in January of 2021. The two were not shy about sharing their love on social media and celebrated their first anniversary in November. A month later, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan confessed his love for Harvey and expressed how the relationship positively influenced his life. “Long story short, I think it’s just the timing of everything. It was the right time for me,” he said, smiling. “Yeah. I’m happy.” “I finally found what love was,” the leading man added. It appeared Harvey shared the same love for Jordan, telling the ladies of “The Real” back in September, “when you know, you know.” “We just really balance each other,” Harvey said at the time. “I really do believe in the statement when they say, ‘When you know you know.’ And I think that really applies to our situation and we just have a really good time together.” However, last month, Harvey was spotted solo in Cannes for the screening of “Final Cut (Coupez!)”, which sparked rumors that things were rocky between the pair. Neither Jordan nor Harvey had publicly addressed the news as of Monday morning, but the SKN founder appears to have deleted all trace of Jordan’s presence from her Instagram after news of their split broke. Photos of the two remain on Jordan’s Instagram page, including a tribute from March to their extravagant night at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. A post shared by Michael B. Jordan (@michaelbjordan) On Sunday, Jordan was spotted  at the 2022 NBA Finals in San Francisco with rapper Cordae. Steve Harvey previously told the Ellen Show that he was happy for his daughter. On Monday, the host noted the challenges of trying to have a successful relationship in the public eye. “Look, as long as everybody can walk away in peace, be friends ... I ain’t heard nobody say they busted no windows or nothing,” he said. “As long as you don’t put your hands on my daughter, I don’t give a damn what you do.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
9,These Republicans Resisted Trump’s Attempt To Steal The Election. They’d Vote For Him Again.,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker of the Arizona state House of Representatives, on Tuesday detailed his efforts to thwart former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 presidential election in stirring testimony to a select congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Bowers told the committee that Trump and his lawyers failed to produce any evidence of fraud, and that they asked him to ignore the law and overturn the election anyway. He became emotional, at times, as he described the barrage of violent threats he and his family have faced since. Bowers read from a journal entry he wrote in December 2020, in which he completely dismissed the then-president’s efforts to undermine democracy: “I do not want to be a winner by cheating,” he wrote. “I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.” Hours later, Bowers said he would vote for Trump again. “If he is the nominee, if he was up against Biden, I’d vote for him again,” Bowers told The Associated Press. “Simply because what he did the first time, before COVID, was so good for the county. In my view it was great.” Bowers was among a small group of Republican elected officials who broke with Trump and refused to go along with the plot to overturn the 2020 election. Now, he is the latest among them to suggest that he would still support Trump in a future contest, even as the former president and his Republican allies intensify their efforts to undermine American democracy. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump’s infamous request to “find” the votes necessary to overturn his state’s election results, did not rule out another vote for Trump in an interview with HuffPost last year. “I think that’s so far out in the future, I don’t even think he’s announced he’s running yet,” Raffensperger, who testified alongside Bowers on Tuesday, said in November. “So let’s circle back and talk about that in the future.” Raffensperger did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on Wednesday. And former Attorney General Bill Barr, who tried to convince Trump that his fraud claims were baseless, said in March that he would support his old boss if Trump were the 2024 Republican nominee. “I certainly have made it clear I don’t think he should be our nominee, and I’m going to support somebody else for the nomination,” Barr said on the “Today” show. But, he added, “because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee.” During Tuesday’s hearing, Bowers described Trump’s haphazard attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a “tragic parody.” But since his unwilling departure from the presidency, Trump and his allies within the GOP have launched a far more coordinated and deliberate assault on democracy, with the apparent aim of taking control of the country’s electoral system in a way that could make it far more likely that a future attempt to undermine an election actually succeeds. Republican election deniers have lined up to run for major statewide offices and congressional seats across the country, with the key swing states that decided the 2020 contest as their chief focus. Candidates who have spread conspiracies about Trump’s defeat have already won primaries in major battlegrounds: The GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania attempted to overturn the 2020 results in his state, while the Republican winner in Nevada’s secretary of state primary questioned the legitimacy of the outcome and has built a coalition of like-minded candidates in an attempt to “take back” control of the American election system. Dozens of Republicans who have embraced Trump’s lies have won congressional primaries, and the GOP is likely to nominate election deniers in statewide primaries in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In May, Raffensperger survived a Republican primary against a Trump-endorsed challenger who twice voted to contest the results of the 2020 election in Congress, and accused Raffensperger of “compromising” Georgia’s elections by refusing to help Trump overturn it. In Bowers’ Arizona, meanwhile, upcoming GOP primaries for governor and secretary of state have been dominated by candidates who have spread conspiracies about the last election or refused to commit to the certification of future contests. The grip Trump and his election lies hold on the GOP has inspired deep fears among experts who worry that American democracy is far more vulnerable ahead of the next presidential contest than it was in 2020, especially as the former president sets the stage to run again. Trump has continued to hold campaign-style rallies since he left the White House, and he hinted at a possible 2024 run as recently as last week. A majority of Republican voters said they would support him in the GOP primary if he does run, according to a recent poll from Morning Consult. And Trump has made it clear that his loss in the 2020 election — as well as his failed effort to overturn the results — would be the driving theme in his next campaign. “We’re not forgetting 2020,” Trump said at a Georgia rally in October. “The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024.” Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Trevor Noah Roasts CNN For Overusing Breaking News Alerts: 'Boy Who Cried Wolf',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Trevor Noah poked fun at CNN on Tuesday for overusing its breaking news banner after its new leader directed staffers to cut back on the practice. “For years, CNN has been notorious for overhyping every story like it’s the zombie apocalypse,” “The Daily Show” host said. “It’s like, ‘BREAKING NEWS: The midterm elections are now six months away!’” “And not surprisingly, this approach has started to backfire, as viewers have learned to tune it out. Like the boy who cried wolf. Or in this case, the Wolf who cried wolf,” Noah added, as an image of veteran CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer appeared on screen. Chris Licht, the new chairman of CNN, recently told employees that moving forward, the breaking news banner would be reserved only for major news, according to The New York Times. CNN updated its standards guide to state that a story must qualify as “‘Stop what you are doing and watch’ news” to secure the “Breaking News” label.

11,Adam Sandler Says His Black Eye Was The Result Of A 'Bed Accident',entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Adam Sandler is on the mend after what he described as an unusual incident involving a hotel bed and his cell phone. The Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominated actor stopped by “Good Morning America” on Monday to promote his new movie, “Hustle.” Before he could chat about the film, however, he was asked by co-host Michael Strahan to explain a bruise and scab that had formed just below his left eye. The incident, Sandler explained, had taken place as he attempted to retrieve his phone in the middle of the night. “Somebody tucked in the sheets too much,” he said. “I had my phone in the middle of the bed. I kicked my feet up [to] untuck it. The phone went flying, hit me in the head.” Watch Adam Sandler’s “Good Morning America” appearance below. Though Sandler said he “felt blood” immediately afterward, he “refused to acknowledge” his wound until the next morning. “There’s nothing cool about this thing,” he quipped. “When I’m on the streets of New York, I see people going: ‘Oh, OK. He likes to fight, that guy.’ I’m like: ‘It was a bed accident.’” Sandler’s injury was a hot topic yet again during his Monday night appearance on “The Tonight Show,” during which he shared some slightly more gruesome details with host Jimmy Fallon. “I was bleeding terribly,” he said. “It was pitch black in the room and I feel wetness and I go, ‘Yes, I’m gonna trick myself. Those are probably just thick tears.’ ... I didn’t want to get up because I was tired. And I was like: ‘Ah, we’ll fix that later.’ Then I woke up, it was horrible. There was blood on the bed and all that stuff.” In better news, Sandler is winning raves for his role in the basketball drama “Hustle,” which hits Netflix Wednesday. The Hollywood Reporter praised the movie’s “depth of feeling” and “disarming sincerity,” while the Los Angeles Times compared Sandler’s performance favorably to that of Tom Cruise in 1996’s “Jerry Maguire.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Reveals Intense Superhero Look In 'Black Adam' Trailer,entertainment,"  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has debuted a fierce superhero look in the trailer for his upcoming DC Comics film “Black Adam.” The flick follows the anti-hero of the same name who – after roughly 5,000 years of imprisonment – becomes free to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world,” according to the trailer’s description. Johnson expressed interest in playing the character in 2007 and was set to make his first DC Extended Universe appearance in the 2019 superhero film “Shazam!,” a film about Black Adam’s enemy. Those plans, however, were scrapped in favor of the spinoff film for Johnson’s character. Watch the trailer for “Black Adam,” set for an October 19 release date, below: “Black Adam” marks one of two superhero movies expected to feature Johnson in 2022. He is also going to provide the voice of Superman’s dog Krypto in the upcoming film “DC League of Super-Pets.” “Black Adam” is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed “Jungle Cruise” featuring Johnson last year. In an interview with Variety, Collet-Serra called Black Adam the “Dirty Harry of superheroes” in a reference to the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller. "
13,Woman's Lost Dachshund Is Found ... In Hilary Swank's Lap,entertainment," ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Chelsea Blackwell’s dachshund, Blue, disappeared Monday, and the distraught owner went in search. But when she came upon a line of squad cars and people with cameras near the Greyhound bus station, she set aside her search to investigate. “I noticed there were like eight police cars and people with cameras — I thought maybe somebody got shot,” Blackwell told her local paper, the Times Union. Fortunately, tragedy did not lurk — Blackwell had stumbled upon a movie crew — but ended in a one-in-a-million lucky happenstance. Long story short: Her dog of 15 years was found — by a movie star with a history of rescuing dogs. You won’t believe this, the crew told her, but a celebrity had found her pooch. “I asked them if anyone saw a little brown dog, and they said, ‘Yes, we’ll call her.’” An hour later, a gray car pulled up, and there was tiny Blue sitting in the lap of two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank. “I was like, ‘No way,’” Blackwell said. “As soon as she got out of the car, I kissed Blue and said, ‘Thank you so much.’” Blackwell asked Swank for her autograph, but Swank did better: They took a picture. And Blackwell, wanting to be sure Swank got proper credit, posted the photo on Facebook. “I’d stopped and asked if someone seen a little brown dog? A man walked over to my car and said, yes, this woman picked him up,” she wrote in her post. “I said who? He replied, a celebrity,” Blackwell wrote. “He called the person who had him. And they said she’s on her way back. You’ll never guess who had him?” The Million Dollar Baby herself. “She’s not the type of person,” Blackwell said, “who’s going to blow the horn telling people what she did.” Swank is no stranger to rescuing dogs. “Every dog I’ve ever rescued and also shared my life with have all had their unique way of being in the world,” said Swank, who has adopted numerous dogs, in a YouTube video posted by People magazine. Swank established a foundation, Hilaroo — a portmanteau of her name and the name of a dog she adopted, Karoo — that matches abandoned dogs with children whom the foundation says “have been given up on by society.”"

The “Late Show” host noted on Tuesday that the charges for seditious conspiracy carry maximum potential sentences of up to 20 years in prison. “I gotta tell you,” he said, “seeing those guys arrested makes this boy proud.” But Colbert also mentioned some unusual rules the gang has, such as only being allowed to masturbate once a month. “That’s gonna make those 20 years in prison seem pretty long,” he cracked. “But I do understand why they’re so angry.” See more in his Tuesday night monologue: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
15,Biden Jokes With Kimmel About Republican Rule-Breakers: 'You Gotta Send 'Em To Jail',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden told Jimmy Kimmel he won’t bend the rules, as some Republicans do, because if he does, “our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.” The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host asked Biden during an in-studio interview Wednesday whether he would consider issuing an executive order in response to gun violence, considering how former President Donald Trump “passed those out like Halloween candy” during his tenure. “I have issued executive orders within the power of the presidency to be able to deal with these, everything having to do with guns and gun ownership ... all the things that are within my power,” Biden replied. “What I don’t want to do ― and I’m not being facetious ― I don’t want to emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and the constitutional authority.” “I often get asked: Look, the Republicans don’t play it square. Why do you play it square? Yeah, well, guess what? If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy,” he said. Kimmel pushed back, saying he understood the argument but said it was like playing Monopoly with someone who won’t play by the rules. “How do you ever make any progress if they’re not following the rules?” he asked. “You gotta send ’em to jail,” Biden replied.

1,This Drake Bar Encounter With Two Fans Should Happen To All Of Us,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost You know what makes happy hour happier? Bellying up to the bar with rapper Drake and knocking back shots with him ― on his dime. (Watch the video below.) Such was the lucky fate of Brittney Keara, who filmed the footage at a seafood restaurant in Detroit and spilled the details to TMZ last week. The “Certified Lover Boy” artist at first turned down the drink offer from Keara and her friend, explaining he had to catch a flight, she said. He then returned for a few shots ― tequila for him ― and seemed to be having fun as he toasted with the women. But he didn’t seem over the moon about Detroit when Keara asked if he was enjoying the city. The three reportedly made small talk and the four-time Grammy winner upgraded Keara’s whiskey order and covered the whole tab. “Appreciate you,” Keara says. “Welcome to the D!” Last month, the rapper went viral for a reason closer to home. He playfully grilled his son Adonis about where he got his basketball shooting skills after the 4-year-old apparently made 4 of 5 attempts. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Giant White Python Appears On The MTV Stage -- Without Britney Spears,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost A huge snake made its way onto the MTV stage once again on Sunday night. But this time it wasn’t adorning the shoulders of Britney Spears like at the 2001 MTV VMAs. Instead, this reptile was carried by several crew members and received a smooch from a “Jackass” cast member at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. Sean “Poopsie” McInerney, who appeared in the 2022 movie “Jackass Forever” kissing a Texas rat snake, won the golden popcorn for Best Kiss. “Being a new cast member is not easy. It’s kinda weird up here accepting this award alone,” McInerney said during his speech. “But now that I’m a big-time movie star, me and the snake broke up and I found a new love, so let’s bring her out.” This prompted a team of people to bring a 17-foot python onto the stage. Poopies and the snake kissed in #JackassForever and t̶o̶l̶d̶ took home Best Kiss at the #MTVAwards 😘🐍 pic.twitter.com/stUL9DZOQW After giving a quick peck to the massive creature, McInerney joked: “I’m so glad that thing did not bite me just now.” We’re surprised it didn’t bite him, either, because the only proper thing to say to a snake you are trying to romance on the MTV stage is: “I’m a slave 4 U.” Reporter, HuffPost"
3,"Doc Antle, Star Of ‘Tiger King,’ Charged With Money Laundering",entertainment," “Tiger King” star Bhagavan “Doc” Antle has been charged with laundering more than half a million dollars, money federal prosecutors said Monday that he believed to be the proceeds of an operation to smuggle people across the Mexican border into the United States. Charges against Antle and Andrew Jon Sawyer, one of Antle’s employees at Myrtle Beach Safari, were revealed during a federal court hearing in Florence, South Carolina. According to federal prosecutors, Antle and Sawyer laundered $505,000 over a four-month period by doling out checks from businesses they controlled, receiving a 15% fee of the money that passed through their hands. The checks, prosecutors allege, falsely purported to be payment for construction work at Myrtle Beach Safari but were in reality intended to serve as evidence that the recipients had legitimate income. According to the complaint unsealed in court Monday, Antle discussed his plan to conceal the cash he received by inflating tourist numbers at his 50-acre (20-hectare) wildlife tropical preserve. Prosecutors also said he had previously used bulk cash receipts to purchase animals for which he could not use checks. Records for the Horry County jail show Antle and Sawyer were both arrested Friday. Attorneys for both men did not immediately comment on the charges when reached via email. According to authorities, Antle and Sawyer each face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison if convicted. Antle is featured prominently in “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” a 2020 Netflix documentary miniseries that focused on tiger breeders and private zoo operators in the U.S. The series focused heavily on Oklahoma zoo operator Joe Exotic, who also was targeted for animal mistreatment and was convicted in a plot to kill a rival, Carole Baskin. Animal rights advocates have accused Antle of mistreating lions and other wildlife. He was indicted in Virginia in 2020 on animal cruelty and wildlife trafficking charges. In May, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the IRS to probe Antle’s Rare Species Fund, a nonprofit raising money for wildlife conservation. PETA alleges he uses some of the fund’s money to subsidize his safari site in Socastee outside Myrtle Beach. “It’s fitting that ‘Doc’ Antle is behind bars after years of locking up the endangered animals he uses in tawdry photo ops. His legal woes are mounting, as PETA recently blew the whistle on his apparent ‘charity’ scam, and the end to his reign of terrorizing tiger cubs can’t come soon enough,” said Debbie Metzler, associate director of PETA’s Captive Animal Law Enforcement division, in a statement. Meanwhile, in Virginia, Antle is facing two felony counts of wildlife trafficking and conspiracy to wildlife trafficking charges, as well as 13 misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to violate the Endangered Species Act and animal cruelty charges tied to trafficking lion cubs. Those charges are scheduled to go to trial next month. Antle has a history of recorded violations, going as far back as 1989, when he was fined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for abandoning deer and peacocks at his zoo in Virginia. Over the years, he has more than 35 USDA violations for mistreating animals. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP."
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward.

10,Paramount Facing Lawsuit Over ‘Top Gun’ Copyright Claim,entertainment," The widow and son of the man who wrote the 1983 article that inspired the original “Top Gun” are suing Paramount Pictures over its sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick.” In a complaint filed in California federal court Monday, Shosh Yonay and Yuval Yonay claim that the rights to Ehud Yonay’s story reverted back to them on Jan. 24, 2020. The lawsuit contends that Paramount, which produced and distributed the sequel, did not reacquire those rights before releasing the film in May. A spokesperson for Paramount Pictures said in a statement that the claims “are without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” The lawsuit says that Paramount has been on notice since 2018 that the Yonays intended to recover the copyright under a provision that lets artists do so after 35 years. According to the suit, the Yonays sent a cease-and-desist letter in early May to which Paramount responded that the film had been sufficiently completed by Jan. 24, 2020, and was not derivative of Yonay’s article. The Yonays counter that the film is a derivative of the 1983 article and that “Top Gun: Maverick” didn’t wrap until May 2021, over a year after the rights expired. Yonay’s original article about the Navy Fighter Weapons School training program and two pilots in the course, the hotshot “Yogi” and his friend “Possum,” was published in the May 1983 issue of California magazine. Soon after, Paramount Pictures acquired the exclusive motion picture rights. “Top Gun” was released in 1986 and went on to become the No. 1 film of the year. The sequel has been in development for years and was originally set for a July 2019 release but was delayed many times —- first for normal reasons and then because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Top Gun: Maverick” finally opened in theaters on May 27, has spent two weeks atop the box office and has already made over $557 million in ticket sales worldwide."
11,Netflix's New ‘Resident Evil’ Trailer Turns Up The Heat With More Than Just Zombies,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Netflix’s first-ever “Resident Evil” TV series is taking a different direction when it comes to bone-chilling scares. The eight-episode series, which begins July 14 on the streaming service, is a new take on Capcom’s long-running survival horror franchise. The trailer for the franchise’s first live-action show promises nonstop action and plenty of gross scares. Footage from the trailer showcases monsters popularized by the video game franchise, such as the zombie dogs from the original 1996 title, plus an array of giant, mutated monsters. Move over, zombies, it looks like outrageously large man-eating spiders are taking over. A post shared by Resident Evil (@residentevilnetflix) ​​Showrunner and executive producer Andrew Dabb previously revealed that the show’s creators took “all the games and shuffled them together” for the highly anticipated series. “For every type of Resident Evil fan, including those joining us for the first time, the series will be complete with a lot of old friends, and some things (bloodthirsty, insane things) people have never seen before,” Dabb said . When the Wesker kids move to New Raccoon City, the secrets they uncover might just be the end of everything.

12,Harvey Weinstein Facing Criminal Charges For Alleged 1996 Assault In London,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Disgraced former producer Harvey Weinstein is facing two criminal charges in the U.K. after he was accused of sexually assaulting an unnamed woman in London in August 1996. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it had authorized London’s Metropolitan Police to charge Weinstein with two counts of “indecent assault.” The charges follow “a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation,” the statement said. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial,” it said. Weinstein, 70, was sentenced to 23 years behind bars in New York state in 2020 for sexually assaulting two women: a former production assistant and an actress. A panel of appellate judges upheld the conviction last week. He was transferred to a facility in California last year to face more criminal sexual assault charges. A grand jury heard testimony from five women before returning their indictment for incidents that allegedly occurred between 2004 and 2013. Weinstein has denied all charges of nonconsensual sex. Accusations against him had been rumored for decades, but were cast into the global spotlight with two exposes published in October 2018 by The New York Times and The New Yorker. More allegations surfaced in the weeks and months afterward, revealing an alleged pattern of abuse wherein Weinstein would prey on young actors eager to make a name for themselves by inviting them in for meetings where they would find themselves alone with him.

13,Uvalde Native Matthew McConaughey: 'It’s Time We Talk About Gun Responsibility',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Actor Matthew McConaughey says the recent school shooting in his home town of Uvalde, Texas, is a sign that the U.S. must talk about “gun responsibility.” In an op-ed published Monday in the Austin American-Statesman, McConaughey wrote that he supports the right for “responsible, law-abiding Americans” to bear arms, but argued Americans “have a cultural obligation to take steps toward slowing down the senseless killing of our children.” McConaughey, who has considered going into politics, noted that the current debate about gun control “has delivered nothing but status quo,” and said “it’s time we talk about gun responsibility.” He then explained the difference between “gun control” and “gun responsibility.” “The first is a mandate that can infringe on our right; the second is a duty that will preserve it,” McConaughey wrote. “There is no constitutional barrier to gun responsibility. Keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people is not only the responsible thing to do, it is the best way to protect the Second Amendment. We can do both.” McConaughey offered a four-point plan for gun responsibility that he said can “restore responsible gun ownership in our country,” including comprehensive background checks for gun users, limiting sales of assault rifles to people over 21 (except for those serving in the military), red flag laws and a national waiting period for assault rifles. Although the actor admitted he has no illusions his proposed policies will solve all acts of gun violence, he said “if responsible solutions can stop some of these tragedies from striking another community without destroying the Second Amendment, they’re worth it.” You can read the complete op-ed here. He posted similar sentiments on Twitter a day after the Uvalde school shooting. Uvalde, Texas, USA. pic.twitter.com/0iULRGtREm McConaughey’s suggestions come at a time when Democratic lawmakers, and a small group of Republicans, are pushing to enact gun measures in response to the shooting in Uvalde and another mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. The House is expected to pass a gun control package soon, but it’s unlikely to pass the House, where Republicans can easily filibuster bills they oppose. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a deal for gun safety but has not yet finalized a plan. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,‘Joker 2’ Movie Confirmed By Director Todd Phillips On Social Media,entertainment," Associate Reporter, HuffPost Director Todd Phillips has confirmed a sequel to the 2019 Oscar-winning supervillain film, “Joker,” on Instagram. Phillips, who directed the first Joker installment, posted a cryptic message on Instagram showing the cover page of a script titled “Joker: Folie à Deux.” The second slide of the post shows actor Joaquin Phoenix, who starred in the first installment, reading a script in his lap. The upcoming film’s apparent name, “Folie à Deux,” is a reference to a mental disorder described in the U.S. National Library of Medicine as an “identical or similar mental disorder affecting two or more individuals, usually the members of a close family.” In the first film, Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a distraught comedian who eventually descends into mental anguish and criminality, leading him to become the Joker, one of the most infamous villains in the DC Universe. The Hollywood Reporter first reported in 2019 that Phillips was developing a second movie about the Joker with Warner Bros. Pictures, citing unnamed sources. The director’s first film about the villain, who was made famous by the Batman franchise, earned 11 Oscar nominations in 2019, with Phoenix winning the Oscar for Best Actor in 2020. Phoenix became the second actor to win for the role after the late Heath Ledger won a Best Supporting Actor award for his work in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Night” in 2009.

The rumble that erupted between Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) and Maddy (Alexa Demie) on “Euphoria” has won Best Fight at the awards ceremony Sunday night (Here’s a clip of the scene, which has more or less wall-to-wall NSFW language.) “Maddy might have gotten the last punch, but Cassie has never, ever been happier,” Sweeney said while accepting the golden popcorn award. Our #MTVAwards nominees for Best Fight battled it out and Cassie vs Maddy from @euphoriaHBO came out the winner 💥👊 Congratulations to @sydney_sweeney and @AlexaDemie! pic.twitter.com/JDVdY0h1o4 The two former besties were the only characters from a television series who were nominated in the category. As humble high school students, they are also the most grounded of the various nominees, many of whom were superhuman. The fight between Guy and Dude from the video game action flick “Free Guy” was also nominated, along with three epic battles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — Black Widow vs. the Widows in “Black Widow,” Shang-Chi’s bus fight in “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and the final battle involving all three Spider-Men from “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Some people on Twitter felt the win was hilarious. HAHAHAHAHAhttps://t.co/LGLnMy28Bt While others felt the win was somewhat disrespectful to more complicated action sequences. This over the Statue of Liberty battle? Really? pic.twitter.com/DJyRfI0Zfq So, there you have it. A catfight won Best Fight. So, congrats to Cassie and Maddy from “Euphoria” for their win. And thank you, MTV, for glorifying what many perceive as a “catfight” and continuing to reinforce stereotypes about women and teenage girls for the sake of a potentially viral moment. Job well done.

0,Foo Fighters Planning 2 Tribute Concerts For Taylor Hawkins,entertainment," NEW YORK (AP) — Foo Fighters will honor the rock band’s late drummer Taylor Hawkins with a pair of tribute concerts in September — one in London and the other in Los Angeles. The twin shows will take place Sept. 3 at London’s Wembley Stadium and Sept. 27 at The Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, featuring “his bandmates and his inspirations playing the songs that he fell in love with, and the ones he brought to life,” the band said in a statement. Lineups for each show will be announced at a later date. Hawkins died March 25 during a South American tour with the rock band. He was 50. Taylor’s wife, Alison, took to social media to thank the band and its fans for their support. “In celebration of his life, is now up to all of us who loved him most to honor Taylor’s legacy and the music he gave us.” Hawkins was Alanis Morissette’s touring drummer when he joined Foo Fighters in 1997, first appearing with the band on the tour supporting its sophomore album “The Colour & The Shape.” He made his recording debut with Foo Fighters on 1999′s “There Is Nothing Left To Lose.” Hawkins played on every subsequent band album, including “One by One” and “In Your Honor,” and on hit singles like “Best of You.” The band canceled its tour after Hawkins’ death. At the Grammy Awards on April 3, an extended tribute to Hawkins played before the show’s In Memoriam segment honoring artists and music industry figures who’ve died. Billie Eilish paid homage to Hawkins during her performance by sporting a black T-shirt with his image."
1,Adam Sandler's Story Of Swimming At A Nude Beach Goes Off The Rails,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Adam Sandler said Monday he was the “Sandman just floating around” in the sea in Spain when he came upon a nude beach. (Watch the video below.) So he did as the Spaniards do ― well, at least the ones at the naked Mediterranean enclave ― and stripped off his shorts. But instantly he thought he “shouldn’t do this.” “Someone is gonna take my picture and ruin my life,” he told host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.” The salty water kept his bits in view even when he tried pushing down, he claimed, and they caught the attention of seagulls. This is where fact and shtick seem to blur, as the “Hustle” star described a conversation in which the hungry birds debated whether it was a worm or a McDonald’s fry. “I was a guest in their country,” Sandler said. “I gave it to ’em. I said, ‘You have a good time.’” Sandler’s new basketball movie “Hustle,” which was partially shot in Spain, arrives Wednesday on Netflix. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
2,'Black Bird' Trailer Offers Chilling Look At Ray Liotta's Final TV Role,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Apple TV+ has unveiled a first look at Ray Liotta’s final television performance with the trailer for “Black Bird,” due out July 8. The six-episode true crime series stars Taron Egerton as Jimmy Keene, a high school football hero who is convicted of a crime and sentenced to 10 years in jail. Once behind bars, however, Jimmy is given an unusual choice by prosecutors: he can either serve his full sentence without the possibility of parole, or transfer to a maximum-security prison to befriend a suspected serial killer, Larry Hall (Paul Walter Hauser), and get him to confess to additional murders. Liotta, who died last month at age 67, plays James “Big Jim” Keene, Jimmy’s anguished father and a former police officer. “I never wanted this for you,” the character tells his son in the opening scene of the trailer. “I wanted a totally different life — a steady paycheck, kids, a family.” Catch the “Black Bird” trailer below. “Black Bird” is based on the younger Keene’s 2010 memoir, “In With the Devil: A Fallen Hero, a Serial Killer, and a Dangerous Bargain for Redemption.” The series was developed and executive-produced by author Dennis Lehane, best known for “Mystic River” and “Gone, Baby, Gone,” both of which were adapted into successful films. While “Black Bird” is being touted as Liotta’s last TV role, the “Goodfellas” actor recently completed work on at least two films, “El Tonto” and “Cocaine Bear,” which have yet to be released. At the time of his death, Liotta was filming “Dangerous Waters,” a thriller co-starring Eric Dane and Odeya Rush. He died in his sleep in the Dominican Republic, where that movie was being shot.

3,'Weird Al' Yankovic's Raucous 'God Save The Queen' Is The Perfect Royal Antidote,entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Royal fatigue may be setting in because the Sex Pistols’ legendary anti-royal anthem “God Save The Queen” just reached the top of the British singles charts ― 45 years after it was released. The band rereleased the track to coincide with Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee celebration. On its initial 1977 release ― during the queen’s Silver Jubilee ― the song peaked at number 2 on the charts despite being banned for poor taste. But there’s another version of the track that was created during a different royal event that’s also worth celebrating. And it’s by “Weird Al” Yankovic. “This is kind of inappropriate the day after a royal wedding,” Yankovic joked before launching into the song at a concert in Napa, California on May 20, 2018, one day after Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle. The track is from his Ridiculously Self-Indulgent Ill-Advised Vanity Tour, in which he largely eschewed the parodies he’s best known for in favor of his original music. Listen as his band ― famed for being able to mimic just about any style ― goes punk while Yankovic breaks out his best growl, even rolling his “r” just as Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) did on the original: Yankovic is currently on the road with The Unfortunate Return of The Ridiculously Self-Indulgent Ill-Advised Vanity Tour, and he’s once again focusing on his originals (and performing a straight cover toward the end of every show). Lydon, for his part, has insisted he’s not against the queen as a person, only the monarchy as an institution. He even offered congrats to Queen Elizabeth for the jubilee. “God bless the Queen,” Lydon wrote in an op-ed earlier this month. “She’s put up with a lot.” Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York.

13,Trevante Rhodes Is Mike Tyson In Fighting Form On New Hulu Series,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Trevante Rhodes is ready to duke it out as boxer Mike Tyson in the first footage of a new and unauthorized series about the heavyweight champion’s life. Hulu on Wednesday gave fans a first look at the “Moonlight” actor in fighting form with the release of a teaser for “Mike,” due out Aug. 25. The eight-episode series is billed as a “no-holds-barred look” at Tyson, both in and out of the ring, and promises to be “one wild ride.” According to press notes, “Mike” also “examines class in America, race in America, fame and the power of media, misogyny, the wealth divide, the promise of the American Dream and ultimately our own role in shaping [Tyson’s] story.” Catch the teaser for “Mike” below. By all accounts, Tyson is a divisive figure in pop culture at large. In 1992, the New York native was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, serving three. His boxing license was briefly revoked in 1997 after he bit off a part of opponent Evander Holyfield’s ear during a match. From the looks of the clip, “Mike” won’t shy away from any of those controversies. And series screenwriter Steven Rogers is known for capturing the nuances of complicated athletes. His screenplay for 2017’s “I, Tonya,” about disgraced Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding, received numerous accolades and a BAFTA Award nomination. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Rogers said he wanted to present Tyson as a “compelling, contradictory, and complex” figure, not a heroic one. “I think the thing people responded to in ‘I, Tonya’ was, we took a story everyone thought they knew and we tried to show there’s much more to it than just the sound bites the media gives us,” he said. “In some ways, [Tyson’s life is] a cautionary tale of the American Dream.” “You can find the roots of a lot of issues we’re grappling with today like #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, prison reform, mental health issues in it,” he added. “It seemed like a good time to tell it.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

Reynolds won the award for Best Comedic Performance for his film “Free Guy” at the MTV Movie & TV Awards Sunday night. Although the actor didn’t attend the ceremony, he sent a prerecorded acceptance speech that was delivered by Steve-o of “Jackass” fame. “Hey MTV, I’m Steve-o, accepting this award on Ryan Reynolds’ behalf because sadly, he wasn’t just unable to appear in person, he can’t even do his video acceptance speech,” Steve-o said: Comedy at its finest 👏 You voted and @VancityReynolds won Best Comedic Performance at the #MTVAwards! pic.twitter.com/GUd3uqK9pn Steve-o then thanked a bunch of Reynolds’ co-stars from “Free Guy,” including Jodie Comer, Lil Rel Howery and Joe Keery. As Steve-o struggled to remember Utkarsh Ambudkar’s last name, the camera panned back to reveal Reynolds texting in the background. “Ambudkar,” Reynolds said. “Super talented.” After Steve-o talked about how personal making “Free Guy” was for Reynolds, he asked the actor if there was anything else he’d like to include in the acceptance speech. “No,” Reynolds said, “I just want you to kick me in the balls.” To see what transpires, check out the video above.

15,"Tim Burton Roasts Warner Bros. Over Batsuit, Reflects On ‘Batman Returns’ 30th Anniversary",entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Director Tim Burton is opening up about his rift with Warner Bros. amid the “Batman Returns” 30th anniversary. During a recent interview with Empire magazine, the fantasy and gothic visionary ripped the entertainment company that had replaced him for the third film after declaring “Batman Returns” was “too dark.” Despite the 1992 movie’s popularity, Warner Bros. decided to nix Burton from directing any more movies about the caped crusader and swapped him with Joel Schumacher for “Batman Forever” and “Batman & Robin.” “They went the other way,” said Burton. “That’s the funny thing about it. But then I was like, ‘Wait a minute. Okay. Hold on a second here. You complain about me, I’m too weird, I’m too dark, and then you put nipples on the costume? Go fuck yourself.’ Seriously. So, yeah, I think that’s why I didn’t end up” doing a third film. Nodding to the newest installment of the franchise, this year’s edgy rendition of Gotham’s protector from Matt Reeves, “The Batman” demonstrated just how deranged the character could get. Burton pointed out the irony of the latest film, telling Empire: “It is funny to see this now, because all these memories come back of, ‘It’s too dark,’ So, it makes me laugh a little bit.” Even though “Batman Returns” has its share of ballsy moments (exploding penguins and latex galore), Burton said he appreciates the film beyond just the darkness it’s been popularized for. “I’m not just overly dark. That represents me in the sense that… that’s how I see things. It’s not meant as pure darkness. There’s a mixture,” he said. “I feel really fondly about it because of the weird experiment that it felt like.” Revisit the “Batman Returns” trailer below. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

0,‘Fire Island’ Remixes A Classic Jane Austen Tale — While Blazing Its Own Path,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The long journey of getting “Fire Island” to the screen began with some vacation reading. In the summer of 2015, comedians and friends Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang went to Fire Island, the gay mecca off the coast of Long Island, New York. Booster brought a copy of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” to read during the trip. “As I was reading it on the island, it really struck me that Austen’s observations about class and the ways in which people interact with each other across class lines felt really prescient and really current to me, especially in the setting that we were in,” Booster said in an interview. Austen’s characters are often subtle and petty in their cruelty, “in ways that leaves them plausible deniability about how cruel they’re actually being,” he said. “I think it’s very current. I mean, it’s shade, you know?” Once Booster saw the parallels between the rigid social dynamics and unspoken rules that Austen critiques in her novels and the ones that play out every summer on Fire Island, he couldn’t unsee them. That became the basis for “Fire Island,” which Booster wrote and stars in as Noah, a character inspired by Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet. Noah is also the movie’s narrator, guiding the audience through the island’s social scene, which is rife with classism and racism. As he explains at a party early in the movie: “A lot of people think you have to be successful, white and rich, with 7% body fat, to vacation on Fire Island. Those people are all at this party.” “Fire Island,” premiering on Hulu on Friday, continues the great tradition of movies that cleverly remix Austen tropes into modern retellings, like “Bridget Jones’ Diary” and “Clueless.” The latter was a north star for Booster when writing “Fire Island.” At the same time, the movie is charting a new path. Released just in time for Pride Month, “Fire Island” is a rom-com with four queer Asian American stars: Booster and Yang as best friends Noah and Howie, Conrad Ricamora as Noah’s Mr. Darcy-like love interest Will, and Margaret Cho as Erin, who serves as a matriarch to Noah, Howie and their friends. Erin has fallen on hard times and is about to lose her modest house, where Noah and Howie’s friend group stays every summer. By contrast, Will and his mostly white, finance bro friends have much fancier digs. The movie’s release marks the beginning of a big June for Booster, who joked: “It’s going to be the month of Joel. If I make it to the end of the month, if I survive it, it will be a miracle.” He also co-stars in the new Apple TV+ comedy series “Loot,” premiering June 24 and created by TV comedy veterans Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard. Maya Rudolph stars as the ex-wife of a tech CEO. She decides to apply her massive fortune toward charitable causes (à la MacKenzie Scott). Booster plays her loyal and long-suffering assistant, helping her navigate her new lifestyle and redefine her public image. That same week, on June 21, Netflix will release “Joel Kim Booster: Psychosexual,” his first filmed stand-up special since 2017. “Part of the reason I think I waited so long to do another special was because, for me, stand-up specials are really tricky because I didn’t want it to just be, like, my show with three cameras,” he said. Instead, he wanted to try “making it feel almost like a meta-commentary on the idea of shooting a stand-up special,” such as showing his interactions with the crowd and talking directly to the camera crew. “I didn’t want to just pretend the cameras weren’t there.” “It might work. It might be a huge failure,” Booster said. “But I think comedy specials are, for me anyways, the perfect place to experiment with stuff that’s not just your regular show.” In some ways, “Fire Island” also began kind of experimentally. At first, the idea was a running joke. Every time Booster and his friends returned to Fire Island, he continued noticing the parallels between the social mores on the island and those of Austen’s world. “I kept jokingly being like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be funny if I wrote a ‘Pride and Prejudice’ adaptation that took place on Fire Island?’” Booster said. “And everyone was like, ‘That sounds really dumb.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, but like, it would be funny, right?’” A few years later, Penguin Random House asked him to write an essay about Austen’s enduring power, in which he wrote about those observations he’d collected on Fire Island. When Booster was between a couple of stalled projects, his agent suggested writing a movie or TV show based on the essay. Booster initially bristled at the idea, thinking he’d “get dragged so hard for writing ‘Gay Pride and Prejudice.’” Then, one day, while bored on a long flight, he opened his laptop, and out came a half-hour pilot script. No one was really interested in it, except for Quibi. At the time, he was starring in the sadly short-lived NBC sitcom “Sunnyside,” and according to Booster, his contract delineated he couldn’t do other TV work. But because Quibi “technically wasn’t TV, it technically wasn’t really a movie, there was a lot of gray area in terms of my contract with NBC,” Booster said. “So we went with Quibi, and the rest is history.” (RIP, Quibi.) In 2021, Searchlight Pictures bought the project, and it was reborn as a feature film, with Andrew Ahn coming on board as director. Ahn, who, like Booster, is gay and Korean American, loved how Booster’s script was all about queer joy and friendship. “I really wanted to make something that showed the experience of being gay and Asian American and silly with your best group of friends,” Ahn said, noting that he had already “made my sad gay Asian American movie” with his directorial debut “Spa Night.” “It’s something that I’ve done before and I think is really valuable and I’ll probably do again, because yeah, it’s important to acknowledge the difficulties. With ‘Fire Island,’ that’s definitely a part of the film,” Ahn said. “But the main focus really is the joy. And that for me is also so valuable, so I’m really glad that I could get this opportunity to really focus on that.” In developing the look and feel of “Fire Island,” Ahn turned to stories about great friends and comedies that blend humor with “a lot of heart and humanity,” including “The Wedding Banquet,” “Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion,” and “Broad City.” While Booster and Ahn sought to make something new and one of a kind, it’s impossible not to be inspired by the many Austen adaptations and modern retellings. “The source material is so good, and the adaptations have been so good. It would be foolish of us to throw that out the window and try and, like, create something from scratch,” Ahn said. In the all-important debate over the two most famous “Pride and Prejudice” screen adaptations, Booster said he’s a “BBC miniseries loyalist,” referring to the 1995 Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version. Ahn prefers the 2005 film adaptation, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen and directed by Joe Wright. The latter was particularly influential in creating the will-they-won’t-they tension between Noah and Will. For instance, another parallel between Austen’s world and the island’s social scene is that “the big marquee moments happen at parties,” Booster said. The “Fire Island” version of Austen’s Netherfield Ball is the movie’s recreation of the island’s famed underwear party, where Noah and Will find themselves dancing together, getting closer and closer. Booster wrote the scene after he and Ahn remembered a moment from Wright’s adaptation “when Darcy is helping Elizabeth into a carriage, and it’s very subtle. They’re just touching hands. But it is this moment of such electricity,” Booster said. “And it’s so clear that despite what they might think about each other, there is an undeniable chemistry between these two people and undeniable attraction.” Therefore, Noah and Will similarly needed that moment where they “feel a certain chemistry, even if they don’t totally understand it,” Ahn said. In addition to Austen tropes, “Fire Island” also cleverly references classic rom-com tropes. There’s the enemies-to-lovers plotline. There are meet-cutes and pratfalls. Someone will write a letter. Someone will attempt a grand (and potentially colossally stupid) romantic gesture. There may be some kissing in the rain. As Booster said, there’s something classic about “the juxtaposition of feeling miserable but still feeling sexy.” “I grew up and still do worship at the altar of Nora Ephron. I love classic rom-coms, I grew up watching them,” Booster said. “They completely colonized my brain in a very specific way that made dating and actually falling in love very difficult because I had such high expectations for what that should look like and what that should feel like.” In “Fire Island,” Howie embodies that conflict, trying to fight his idealized rom-com impulses about love — but eventually giving in to them. By contrast, Noah, who’s a bit more cynical and pragmatic, represents “the more grounded side of myself,” Booster said. “It’s like, ‘Where is this going? What are we doing?’ And the magic of Fire Island is overriding those more logical impulses in the character.” Howie gets his classic rom-com ending, while Booster wanted Noah and Will’s budding romance to end with more ambiguity. The two, who live in different cities, now have to figure out how to make their relationship work. Ironically, as with the idea for the movie, real life intervened. Booster changed the ending after he, like Noah, met his now-boyfriend while on vacation. “I just thought it was a more honest way to end on the ambiguity of ‘What’s next?’” he said. By giving its characters the best of both worlds, “Fire Island” nods toward the neat and pat endings of Austen novels, which typically end with happily ever after, and conventional rom-coms, which often end that way, too. However, it also recognizes that real life is more complicated. Magical vacations have to end — but they can also be new beginnings. “Fire Island” premieres on Hulu on Friday.

1,"Michael B. Jordan, Lori Harvey Reportedly Call It Quits After Over 1 Year Together",entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The internet’s cutest couple, Michael B. Jordan and Lori Harvey, have closed the curtains on their relationship after dating for more than a year and a half. The model’s father, Steve Harvey, confirmed the breakup on Monday’s episode of “The Steve Harvey Morning Show,” saying he was “Team Lori, 1,000%.” He didn’t offer much in the way of detail of why they ended their relationship, which started in November 2020. Calling Jordan a “cool guy,” the host shared, “I’m pretty sure they’ll be fine. People break up all the time.” Rumors began to surface on Saturday that Jordan and Lori Harvey broke up, and People verified the news the same day. “Michael and Lori are both completely heartbroken,” a source close to the couple told People. “They still love each other.” The source explained, “Michael matured a lot over the course of their relationship and was ready to commit for the long term. He let down his guard with her, opening up emotionally in a romantic relationship for the first time...They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.” A post shared by Michael B. Jordan (@michaelbjordan) The stylish duo officially announced their relationship and became “Instagram official” in January of 2021. The two were not shy about sharing their love on social media and celebrated their first anniversary in November. A month later, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan confessed his love for Harvey and expressed how the relationship positively influenced his life. “Long story short, I think it’s just the timing of everything. It was the right time for me,” he said, smiling. “Yeah. I’m happy.” “I finally found what love was,” the leading man added. It appeared Harvey shared the same love for Jordan, telling the ladies of “The Real” back in September, “when you know, you know.” “We just really balance each other,” Harvey said at the time. “I really do believe in the statement when they say, ‘When you know you know.’ And I think that really applies to our situation and we just have a really good time together.” However, last month, Harvey was spotted solo in Cannes for the screening of “Final Cut (Coupez!)”, which sparked rumors that things were rocky between the pair. Neither Jordan nor Harvey had publicly addressed the news as of Monday morning, but the SKN founder appears to have deleted all trace of Jordan’s presence from her Instagram after news of their split broke. Photos of the two remain on Jordan’s Instagram page, including a tribute from March to their extravagant night at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. A post shared by Michael B. Jordan (@michaelbjordan) On Sunday, Jordan was spotted  at the 2022 NBA Finals in San Francisco with rapper Cordae. Steve Harvey previously told the Ellen Show that he was happy for his daughter. On Monday, the host noted the challenges of trying to have a successful relationship in the public eye. “Look, as long as everybody can walk away in peace, be friends ... I ain’t heard nobody say they busted no windows or nothing,” he said. “As long as you don’t put your hands on my daughter, I don’t give a damn what you do.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Trevor Noah Roasts CNN For Overusing Breaking News Alerts: 'Boy Who Cried Wolf',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Trevor Noah poked fun at CNN on Tuesday for overusing its breaking news banner after its new leader directed staffers to cut back on the practice. “For years, CNN has been notorious for overhyping every story like it’s the zombie apocalypse,” “The Daily Show” host said. “It’s like, ‘BREAKING NEWS: The midterm elections are now six months away!’” “And not surprisingly, this approach has started to backfire, as viewers have learned to tune it out. Like the boy who cried wolf. Or in this case, the Wolf who cried wolf,” Noah added, as an image of veteran CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer appeared on screen. Chris Licht, the new chairman of CNN, recently told employees that moving forward, the breaking news banner would be reserved only for major news, according to The New York Times. CNN updated its standards guide to state that a story must qualify as “‘Stop what you are doing and watch’ news” to secure the “Breaking News” label.

3,Adam Sandler Says His Black Eye Was The Result Of A 'Bed Accident',entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Adam Sandler is on the mend after what he described as an unusual incident involving a hotel bed and his cell phone. The Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominated actor stopped by “Good Morning America” on Monday to promote his new movie, “Hustle.” Before he could chat about the film, however, he was asked by co-host Michael Strahan to explain a bruise and scab that had formed just below his left eye. The incident, Sandler explained, had taken place as he attempted to retrieve his phone in the middle of the night. “Somebody tucked in the sheets too much,” he said. “I had my phone in the middle of the bed. I kicked my feet up [to] untuck it. The phone went flying, hit me in the head.” Watch Adam Sandler’s “Good Morning America” appearance below. Though Sandler said he “felt blood” immediately afterward, he “refused to acknowledge” his wound until the next morning. “There’s nothing cool about this thing,” he quipped. “When I’m on the streets of New York, I see people going: ‘Oh, OK. He likes to fight, that guy.’ I’m like: ‘It was a bed accident.’” Sandler’s injury was a hot topic yet again during his Monday night appearance on “The Tonight Show,” during which he shared some slightly more gruesome details with host Jimmy Fallon. “I was bleeding terribly,” he said. “It was pitch black in the room and I feel wetness and I go, ‘Yes, I’m gonna trick myself. Those are probably just thick tears.’ ... I didn’t want to get up because I was tired. And I was like: ‘Ah, we’ll fix that later.’ Then I woke up, it was horrible. There was blood on the bed and all that stuff.” In better news, Sandler is winning raves for his role in the basketball drama “Hustle,” which hits Netflix Wednesday. The Hollywood Reporter praised the movie’s “depth of feeling” and “disarming sincerity,” while the Los Angeles Times compared Sandler’s performance favorably to that of Tom Cruise in 1996’s “Jerry Maguire.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"

Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward.

But when she came upon a line of squad cars and people with cameras near the Greyhound bus station, she set aside her search to investigate. “I noticed there were like eight police cars and people with cameras — I thought maybe somebody got shot,” Blackwell told her local paper, the Times Union. Fortunately, tragedy did not lurk — Blackwell had stumbled upon a movie crew — but ended in a one-in-a-million lucky happenstance. Long story short: Her dog of 15 years was found — by a movie star with a history of rescuing dogs. You won’t believe this, the crew told her, but a celebrity had found her pooch. “I asked them if anyone saw a little brown dog, and they said, ‘Yes, we’ll call her.’” An hour later, a gray car pulled up, and there was tiny Blue sitting in the lap of two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank. “I was like, ‘No way,’” Blackwell said. “As soon as she got out of the car, I kissed Blue and said, ‘Thank you so much.’” Blackwell asked Swank for her autograph, but Swank did better: They took a picture. And Blackwell, wanting to be sure Swank got proper credit, posted the photo on Facebook. “I’d stopped and asked if someone seen a little brown dog? A man walked over to my car and said, yes, this woman picked him up,” she wrote in her post. “I said who? He replied, a celebrity,” Blackwell wrote. “He called the person who had him. And they said she’s on her way back. You’ll never guess who had him?” The Million Dollar Baby herself. “She’s not the type of person,” Blackwell said, “who’s going to blow the horn telling people what she did.” Swank is no stranger to rescuing dogs. “Every dog I’ve ever rescued and also shared my life with have all had their unique way of being in the world,” said Swank, who has adopted numerous dogs, in a YouTube video posted by People magazine. Swank established a foundation, Hilaroo — a portmanteau of her name and the name of a dog she adopted, Karoo — that matches abandoned dogs with children whom the foundation says “have been given up on by society.”"
11,Biden Jokes With Kimmel About Republican Rule-Breakers: 'You Gotta Send 'Em To Jail',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost President Joe Biden told Jimmy Kimmel he won’t bend the rules, as some Republicans do, because if he does, “our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.” The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host asked Biden during an in-studio interview Wednesday whether he would consider issuing an executive order in response to gun violence, considering how former President Donald Trump “passed those out like Halloween candy” during his tenure. “I have issued executive orders within the power of the presidency to be able to deal with these, everything having to do with guns and gun ownership ... all the things that are within my power,” Biden replied. “What I don’t want to do ― and I’m not being facetious ― I don’t want to emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and the constitutional authority.” “I often get asked: Look, the Republicans don’t play it square. Why do you play it square? Yeah, well, guess what? If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy,” he said. Kimmel pushed back, saying he understood the argument but said it was like playing Monopoly with someone who won’t play by the rules. “How do you ever make any progress if they’re not following the rules?” he asked. “You gotta send ’em to jail,” Biden replied.

12,Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Reveals Intense Superhero Look In 'Black Adam' Trailer,entertainment,"  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has debuted a fierce superhero look in the trailer for his upcoming DC Comics film “Black Adam.” The flick follows the anti-hero of the same name who – after roughly 5,000 years of imprisonment – becomes free to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world,” according to the trailer’s description. Johnson expressed interest in playing the character in 2007 and was set to make his first DC Extended Universe appearance in the 2019 superhero film “Shazam!,” a film about Black Adam’s enemy. Those plans, however, were scrapped in favor of the spinoff film for Johnson’s character. Watch the trailer for “Black Adam,” set for an October 19 release date, below: “Black Adam” marks one of two superhero movies expected to feature Johnson in 2022.

The “Late Show” host noted on Tuesday that the charges for seditious conspiracy carry maximum potential sentences of up to 20 years in prison. “I gotta tell you,” he said, “seeing those guys arrested makes this boy proud.” But Colbert also mentioned some unusual rules the gang has, such as only being allowed to masturbate once a month. “That’s gonna make those 20 years in prison seem pretty long,” he cracked. “But I do understand why they’re so angry.” See more in his Tuesday night monologue: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
14,Johnny Depp To Release Joint Album With Jeff Beck Next Month,entertainment," NEW YORK (AP) — Fresh off his legal battle with his ex-wife, Johnny Depp has announced that he and legendary guitarist Jeff Beck will release an album of mostly covers next month. The duo’s 13-track album is titled “18” and will drop on July 15. They said they titled the album after the creative outburst they felt working together. “We would joke about how we felt 18 again, so that just became the album title, too,” Beck said in a statement. The album contains covers of The Velvet Underground’s “Venus In Furs,” the Everly Brothers’ ballad “Let It Be Me” and Marvin Gaye’s soul classic “What’s Going On.” There also are versions of Davy Spillane’s “Midnight Walker” and two songs from the Beach Boys’ masterpiece, “Pet Sounds” — “Caroline, No” and “Don’t Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder).” Depp supplied two originals, including “This Is A Song For Miss Hedy Lamarr,” the set’s first single. The cover of the album — a sketch of two young men in white T-shirts — was designed by Beck’s wife, Sandra. Depp, long a member of the rock group Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry, started recording with Beck in 2019, and Depp has joined Beck’s current European tour. Earlier this month, a jury sided with Depp in his defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard, awarding the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor more than $10 million and vindicating his allegations that Heard defamed him by accusing him of abusing her before and during their brief marriage. But in a split decision, the jury also found that Heard was defamed by one of Depp’s lawyers, who accused her of creating a detailed hoax that included roughing up the couple’s apartment to look worse for police. The jury awarded her $2 million."
15,'Ms. Marvel' Star Reveals 'Super Sketchy' Way She Found Out About The Job,entertainment,"  The star of “Ms. Marvel” earned her breakthrough role after receiving a “super sketchy” message from a family member. Iman Vellani, a 19-year-old Pakistani-Canadian actor, will play Ms. Marvel (a.k.a. Kamala Khan) ― the first Muslim superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ― in the new coming-of-age Disney+ series of the same name. Khan is a Pakistani-American girl and fan of superheroes who has “an oversized imagination – particularly when it comes to Captain Marvel,” per Disney+’s description of the series. On “The Tonight Show” Tuesday, Vellani told host Jimmy Fallon how she landed her first acting role after graduating high school. “My aunt forwarded me a WhatsApp of the casting call. Super sketchy, I don’t know what casting calls look like but I’m like obsessed with Marvel [Comics], I’m obsessed with ‘Ms. Marvel,’ I read all the comics in high school, dressed up as her on Halloween,” Vellani said. After she sent in a self-recorded audition tape for the role, Vellani received the Zoom call that would eventually lead to the superhero role: Vellani will also play Khan in “The Marvels,” a Marvel film set for 2023. Sana Amanat, who co-created the Khan character, told Empire how Vellani showed interest in the character during a Zoom audition. “She showed me every corner of her room and it was covered with Avengers,” Amanat said. “Then she said, ‘Oh wait, I’m not done,’ opened up her closet and there was more Marvel everywhere.” Watch Vellani’s full interview with Fallon below: "

0,"Doc Antle, Star Of ‘Tiger King,’ Charged With Money Laundering",entertainment," “Tiger King” star Bhagavan “Doc” Antle has been charged with laundering more than half a million dollars, money federal prosecutors said Monday that he believed to be the proceeds of an operation to smuggle people across the Mexican border into the United States. Charges against Antle and Andrew Jon Sawyer, one of Antle’s employees at Myrtle Beach Safari, were revealed during a federal court hearing in Florence, South Carolina. According to federal prosecutors, Antle and Sawyer laundered $505,000 over a four-month period by doling out checks from businesses they controlled, receiving a 15% fee of the money that passed through their hands. The checks, prosecutors allege, falsely purported to be payment for construction work at Myrtle Beach Safari but were in reality intended to serve as evidence that the recipients had legitimate income. According to the complaint unsealed in court Monday, Antle discussed his plan to conceal the cash he received by inflating tourist numbers at his 50-acre (20-hectare) wildlife tropical preserve. Prosecutors also said he had previously used bulk cash receipts to purchase animals for which he could not use checks. Records for the Horry County jail show Antle and Sawyer were both arrested Friday. Attorneys for both men did not immediately comment on the charges when reached via email. According to authorities, Antle and Sawyer each face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison if convicted. Antle is featured prominently in “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” a 2020 Netflix documentary miniseries that focused on tiger breeders and private zoo operators in the U.S. The series focused heavily on Oklahoma zoo operator Joe Exotic, who also was targeted for animal mistreatment and was convicted in a plot to kill a rival, Carole Baskin. Animal rights advocates have accused Antle of mistreating lions and other wildlife. He was indicted in Virginia in 2020 on animal cruelty and wildlife trafficking charges. In May, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the IRS to probe Antle’s Rare Species Fund, a nonprofit raising money for wildlife conservation. PETA alleges he uses some of the fund’s money to subsidize his safari site in Socastee outside Myrtle Beach. “It’s fitting that ‘Doc’ Antle is behind bars after years of locking up the endangered animals he uses in tawdry photo ops. His legal woes are mounting, as PETA recently blew the whistle on his apparent ‘charity’ scam, and the end to his reign of terrorizing tiger cubs can’t come soon enough,” said Debbie Metzler, associate director of PETA’s Captive Animal Law Enforcement division, in a statement. Meanwhile, in Virginia, Antle is facing two felony counts of wildlife trafficking and conspiracy to wildlife trafficking charges, as well as 13 misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to violate the Endangered Species Act and animal cruelty charges tied to trafficking lion cubs. Those charges are scheduled to go to trial next month. Antle has a history of recorded violations, going as far back as 1989, when he was fined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for abandoning deer and peacocks at his zoo in Virginia. Over the years, he has more than 35 USDA violations for mistreating animals. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP."
1,Paramount Facing Lawsuit Over ‘Top Gun’ Copyright Claim,entertainment," The widow and son of the man who wrote the 1983 article that inspired the original “Top Gun” are suing Paramount Pictures over its sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick.” In a complaint filed in California federal court Monday, Shosh Yonay and Yuval Yonay claim that the rights to Ehud Yonay’s story reverted back to them on Jan. 24, 2020. The lawsuit contends that Paramount, which produced and distributed the sequel, did not reacquire those rights before releasing the film in May. A spokesperson for Paramount Pictures said in a statement that the claims “are without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” The lawsuit says that Paramount has been on notice since 2018 that the Yonays intended to recover the copyright under a provision that lets artists do so after 35 years. According to the suit, the Yonays sent a cease-and-desist letter in early May to which Paramount responded that the film had been sufficiently completed by Jan. 24, 2020, and was not derivative of Yonay’s article. The Yonays counter that the film is a derivative of the 1983 article and that “Top Gun: Maverick” didn’t wrap until May 2021, over a year after the rights expired. Yonay’s original article about the Navy Fighter Weapons School training program and two pilots in the course, the hotshot “Yogi” and his friend “Possum,” was published in the May 1983 issue of California magazine. Soon after, Paramount Pictures acquired the exclusive motion picture rights. “Top Gun” was released in 1986 and went on to become the No. 1 film of the year. The sequel has been in development for years and was originally set for a July 2019 release but was delayed many times —- first for normal reasons and then because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Top Gun: Maverick” finally opened in theaters on May 27, has spent two weeks atop the box office and has already made over $557 million in ticket sales worldwide."
2,Netflix's New ‘Resident Evil’ Trailer Turns Up The Heat With More Than Just Zombies,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Netflix’s first-ever “Resident Evil” TV series is taking a different direction when it comes to bone-chilling scares. The eight-episode series, which begins July 14 on the streaming service, is a new take on Capcom’s long-running survival horror franchise. The trailer for the franchise’s first live-action show promises nonstop action and plenty of gross scares.

3,Harvey Weinstein Facing Criminal Charges For Alleged 1996 Assault In London,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Disgraced former producer Harvey Weinstein is facing two criminal charges in the U.K. after he was accused of sexually assaulting an unnamed woman in London in August 1996. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it had authorized London’s Metropolitan Police to charge Weinstein with two counts of “indecent assault.” The charges follow “a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation,” the statement said. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial,” it said. Weinstein, 70, was sentenced to 23 years behind bars in New York state in 2020 for sexually assaulting two women: a former production assistant and an actress. A panel of appellate judges upheld the conviction last week. He was transferred to a facility in California last year to face more criminal sexual assault charges. A grand jury heard testimony from five women before returning their indictment for incidents that allegedly occurred between 2004 and 2013. Weinstein has denied all charges of nonconsensual sex. Accusations against him had been rumored for decades, but were cast into the global spotlight with two exposes published in October 2018 by The New York Times and The New Yorker. More allegations surfaced in the weeks and months afterward, revealing an alleged pattern of abuse wherein Weinstein would prey on young actors eager to make a name for themselves by inviting them in for meetings where they would find themselves alone with him.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes.

10,Uvalde Native Matthew McConaughey: 'It’s Time We Talk About Gun Responsibility',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Actor Matthew McConaughey says the recent school shooting in his home town of Uvalde, Texas, is a sign that the U.S. must talk about “gun responsibility.” In an op-ed published Monday in the Austin American-Statesman, McConaughey wrote that he supports the right for “responsible, law-abiding Americans” to bear arms, but argued Americans “have a cultural obligation to take steps toward slowing down the senseless killing of our children.” McConaughey, who has considered going into politics, noted that the current debate about gun control “has delivered nothing but status quo,” and said “it’s time we talk about gun responsibility.” He then explained the difference between “gun control” and “gun responsibility.” “The first is a mandate that can infringe on our right; the second is a duty that will preserve it,” McConaughey wrote. “There is no constitutional barrier to gun responsibility. Keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people is not only the responsible thing to do, it is the best way to protect the Second Amendment. We can do both.” McConaughey offered a four-point plan for gun responsibility that he said can “restore responsible gun ownership in our country,” including comprehensive background checks for gun users, limiting sales of assault rifles to people over 21 (except for those serving in the military), red flag laws and a national waiting period for assault rifles. Although the actor admitted he has no illusions his proposed policies will solve all acts of gun violence, he said “if responsible solutions can stop some of these tragedies from striking another community without destroying the Second Amendment, they’re worth it.” You can read the complete op-ed here. He posted similar sentiments on Twitter a day after the Uvalde school shooting. Uvalde, Texas, USA. pic.twitter.com/0iULRGtREm McConaughey’s suggestions come at a time when Democratic lawmakers, and a small group of Republicans, are pushing to enact gun measures in response to the shooting in Uvalde and another mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. The House is expected to pass a gun control package soon, but it’s unlikely to pass the House, where Republicans can easily filibuster bills they oppose. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a deal for gun safety but has not yet finalized a plan. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,‘Joker 2’ Movie Confirmed By Director Todd Phillips On Social Media,entertainment," Associate Reporter, HuffPost Director Todd Phillips has confirmed a sequel to the 2019 Oscar-winning supervillain film, “Joker,” on Instagram. Phillips, who directed the first Joker installment, posted a cryptic message on Instagram showing the cover page of a script titled “Joker: Folie à Deux.” The second slide of the post shows actor Joaquin Phoenix, who starred in the first installment, reading a script in his lap. The upcoming film’s apparent name, “Folie à Deux,” is a reference to a mental disorder described in the U.S. National Library of Medicine as an “identical or similar mental disorder affecting two or more individuals, usually the members of a close family.” In the first film, Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a distraught comedian who eventually descends into mental anguish and criminality, leading him to become the Joker, one of the most infamous villains in the DC Universe. The Hollywood Reporter first reported in 2019 that Phillips was developing a second movie about the Joker with Warner Bros. Pictures, citing unnamed sources. The director’s first film about the villain, who was made famous by the Batman franchise, earned 11 Oscar nominations in 2019, with Phoenix winning the Oscar for Best Actor in 2020. Phoenix became the second actor to win for the role after the late Heath Ledger won a Best Supporting Actor award for his work in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Night” in 2009.

The fight between Guy and Dude from the video game action flick “Free Guy” was also nominated, along with three epic battles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — Black Widow vs. the Widows in “Black Widow,” Shang-Chi’s bus fight in “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and the final battle involving all three Spider-Men from “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Some people on Twitter felt the win was hilarious. HAHAHAHAHAhttps://t.co/LGLnMy28Bt While others felt the win was somewhat disrespectful to more complicated action sequences. This over the Statue of Liberty battle? Really? pic.twitter.com/DJyRfI0Zfq So, there you have it. A catfight won Best Fight. So, congrats to Cassie and Maddy from “Euphoria” for their win. And thank you, MTV, for glorifying what many perceive as a “catfight” and continuing to reinforce stereotypes about women and teenage girls for the sake of a potentially viral moment. Job well done.

13,Washington Post Adds Editor's Note To Amber Heard Op-Ed After Defamation Verdict,entertainment," Assignment editor, HuffPost The opinion piece at the center of the explosive Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial now bears an editor’s note stating that a court ruled the op-ed to be defamatory against Depp. The piece, headlined “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change” was published under Heard’s byline in 2018. It did not mention Depp, her ex-husband, by name. However, it was widely understood that her references to being abused were about their relationship. Depp sued Heard for defamation and on Wednesday, a Virginia court ruled primarily in his favor, finding that three statements in her op-ed were defamatory and awarding Depp $15 million in damages, though that amount was then capped at around $10 million due to state law. The next day, the Post affixed an editor’s note to the top of the op-ed outlining in detail which statements had been found defamatory: Editor’s note, June 2, 2022: In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation arising out of this 2018 op-ed. On June 1, 2022, following a trial in Fairfax County, Va. Circuit Court, a jury found Heard liable on three counts for the following statements, which Depp claimed were false and defamatory: (1) “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” (2) “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” (3) “I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.” The jury separately found that Depp, through his lawyer Adam Waldman, defamed Heard in one of three counts in her countersuit. Legal analyst Emily D. Baker told People it was a good decision to add a note, rather than removing the piece from its website. “Because this case is so watched and commented on, I think the op-ed is still needed for context,” she said. “I appreciate that they put up the notice rather than take the op-ed down. And I appreciate that they included, with specificity, exactly the statements that were found to be defamatory.” Though Depp won his case in the U.S., he lost in 2020 in the United Kingdom when he sued newspaper “The Sun” for calling him a “wife beater.” In that case, a judge found that Heard’s accusations of abuse were “substantially true” and that most of the violent incidents she alleged had been “proved to the civil standard.” Heard has said she plans to appeal the verdict in Depp’s suit against her.

14,"Keanu Reeves, Internet's Boyfriend, Still Going Strong With His Girlfriend, Pics Show",entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant’s excellent adventure appeared in full romantic swing Saturday at a museum event in Los Angeles. More than two years after the “John Wick” star and his artist girlfriend lovingly walked a museum red carpet together to essentially go public with their pairing, the two glowed on another tapis rouge at the 2022 MOCA Gala. They held hands while smiling and gazing into each other’s eyes. It all looked pretty lovey-dovey, don’t ya think? Reeves, sometimes known as “the Internet’s Boyfriend” for his good deeds and happy-go-lucky charm, came out to the world as attached at the November 2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala. He and Grant formed a friendship through art publishing circles and eventually co-founded the publishing house X Artists’ Books with designer Jessica Fleischmann. However, their romance extends well beyond their 2019 public appearance, according to actor Jennifer Tilly. She told Page Six in February 2020 that Grant suggested to her that she and Reeves were a couple at least a year and a half earlier. When the cameras clicked at the museum event, Grant recalled the stir they caused. “I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that’s fascinating,” she told Vogue in March 2020. “But the question I’ve been asking in all of this is: ‘What is the opportunity for good?’” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Rebel Wilson Reacts To Relationship With Girlfriend Nearly Being Exposed By Newspaper,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rebel Wilson’s relationship reveal last week was apparently in response to The Sydney Morning Herald telling her it planned to report she was dating a woman, something the actress later described as a “very hard situation.” On Thursday, the “Pitch Perfect” alum shared on Instagram that she was dating Romona Agruma, a fashion designer. “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” Wilson wrote. A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson) There was more to the story. Andrew Hornery, a columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, revealed soon after that the Australian newspaper had planned to report on her relationship, and that Wilson beat them to the punch. Hornery then published an opinion piece, which has since been removed from its site, saying the outlet had reached out out of “an abundance of caution and respect ... giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with another woman, LA leisure wear designer Ramona Agruma, before publishing a single word.” He continued, “Big mistake. Wilson opted to gazump the story, posting about her new ‘Disney Princess’ on Instagram early Friday morning, the same platform she had previously used to brag about her handsome ex-boyfriend, wealthy American beer baron Jacob Busch.” Hornery stated “who anyone dates is their business,” then pointed to Wilson’s previous relationships and the lack of need to conceal sexual orientation in society in today’s age. “This is understood to be Wilson’s first same-sex relationship, at age 42 and in an era when same-sex marriage is legal in many parts of the world and — thanks to decades of battling for equality — sexual orientation is no longer something to be hidden, even in Hollywood,” he wrote. Kate Doak, a journalist for the Australian network newscast 10 News First, noted on Twitter that Hornery had “admitted to giving [Wilson] a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ‘out’ her.” So apparently it wasn't @RebelWilson's choice to come out... The @smh/@theage  have admitted to giving her a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ""out"" her. What's worse, openly gay men at the Sydney Morning Herald were involved in this. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/Zl80zg01SW Wilson replied directly on Sunday. “Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace,” Wilson wrote. Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace 💗 In response to the outcry, Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields wrote that the newspaper “would have asked the same questions had Wilson’s new partner been a man.” “To say that the Herald ‘outed’ Wilson is wrong,” he wrote. “Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. I had made no decision about whether or what to publish.” Hornery has since published a column saying he “made mistakes” in his reporting and the tone of his column, noting he is gay and is “well aware of how deeply discrimination hurts.” “My email was never intended to be a threat but to make it clear I was sufficiently confident with my information and to open a conversation,” he wrote. “It is not the Herald’s business to ‘out’ people and that is not what we set out to do. But I understand why my email has been seen as a threat. The framing of it was a mistake.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Tony Awards 2022 Red Carpet: See The Best Looks On Broadway's Biggest Night,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Broadway’s biggest stars were ready to mark the end of a thrilling, if tumultuous, theater season in style at the 2022 Tony Awards. The 75th annual ceremony took place Sunday night at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. The show was hosted by Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar earlier this year for “West Side Story” and has an extensive background in musical theater. For many, the night was an unofficial celebration of the return of live theater following an unprecedented, 18-month closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the rebound was bumpier than anticipated, with several shows closing prematurely and others taking unusual measures to postpone or curtail performances to avoid a permanent closure. Even so, talent shone through. This year’s nominees include “A Strange Loop,” a musical which explores issues of Black queer identity, and “MJ: The Musical,” which charts Michael Jackson’s rise to fame through over 25 of his most beloved songs. Also nominated are “Six,” which reimagines the six wives of England’s Henry VIII as a female pop group, and the gender-reversed revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company.” As for plays, “The Lehman Trilogy” is a favorite to win big, while the gay-themed baseball drama “Take Me Out ” boasts a starry cast that includes actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jesse Williams, both of whom are nominated.

2,Jimmy Fallon's Cold Burn Of Fox News For Not Airing Jan. 6 Hearing Is Too Good,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jimmy Fallon issued a cold burn of Fox News for refusing to air the Jan. 6 hearing on Thursday. (Watch the video below.) Now if “cold burn” sounds like an oxymoron, well, it fits here. “The Tonight Show” host noted that the right-wing network apparently didn’t think the probe into the insurrection was news, even though it was carried live by several major channels. “Let’s see what they were focused on instead,” Fallon said. The show cut to a faux news alert with a serious voice intoning, “Tonight on Fox News, is the new Wendy’s pink Frosty trying to turn your kids gay?” Fallon’s mockery of the conservative channel didn’t stop there. Check it out: Fox News’ prime-time star Tucker Carlson led the channel’s denial fest in explaining why the channel did not carry the first public hearing on the Capitol riot to overthrow the 2020 election. “They are lying and we will not let them do it,” he said Thursday.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"

Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza.

On Tuesday, the iconic rapper revealed on Twitter that he gave his full-time blunt roller a raise due to inflation.

13,Some Jurors At Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial Fell Asleep: Court Reporter,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The world may have been riveted by Johnny Depp’s defamation trial against Amber Heard, but some of the jurors? Not so much. According to Judy Bellinger, who was the court reporter for the six-week trial, some of the jurors had a hard time staying awake during the proceedings. “There were a few jurors that were dozing off,” Bellinger told Law & Crime Network, adding that she sympathized with them. “It was tough because there was a lot of video deposition. And they would just sit there and all of a sudden, I’d see their head drop.” One juror who did impress Bellinger was a woman who listened “very deeply” to every word said during the trial. However, she was an alternate and didn’t participate in the deliberation. “I thought she would have been a great juror, but she did not get to see it ’til the end,” Bellinger said.

14,"Lady Gaga In Talks To Join 'Joker' Sequel, Which For Some Reason Will Be A Musical",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Lady Gaga might have met her method acting match in Joaquin Phoenix. Just when the swarms of flies had stopped following the pop star after her equal parts bizarre and hilarious “House of Gucci” press tour, she’s considering a dive even deeper into another role for the much-anticipated “Joker” sequel. The Oscar-winning “A Star Is Born” actor is in talks to play Harley Quinn in the follow-up to director Todd Phillips’ box-office smash about the maniacal Batman villain, according to multiple outlets. The sequel won’t contain just laughs, but songs, too, as the film will reportedly be a musical. But it will likely be a while before Gaga and Phoenix start two-stepping down a flight of stairs, as the project is still early in the development stage. Phoenix, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the titular baddie, has yet to officially sign on to the film, per The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that Warner Bros. is “deep into” negotiations with the star. Phillips officially confirmed that a “Joker” sequel was a go earlier this month. The director shared a cryptic Instagram post showing the cover page of a script titled “Joker: Folie à Deux” alongside a photo of Phoenix reading the material. A post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips) The title loosely translates into English as “shared psychosis” and seemingly refers to a mental disorder “affecting two or more individuals, usually the members of a close family.” Phillips, who produced Gaga’s “A Star Is Born” remake, will once again direct and write the script alongside Scott Silver. Gaga would be the latest performer to step into Harley Quinn’s laced pumps, as Margot Robbie has portrayed the character in multiple films to much acclaim, most recently appearing in 2020’s “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).” Kaley Cuoco voices the psychiatrist-turned-henchwoman in HBO Max’s animated series “Harley Quinn.” “Joker,” however, takes place in a separate universe from the recent slate of DC superhero films, so the musical follow-up won’t step on any toes should Robbie choose to reprise the role. Despite a relatively modest $60 million budget, the gritty origin story of the supervillian raked in more than $1 billion at the box office, becoming the first R-rated film to reach the milestone. “Joker,” which also starred Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy and Robert De Niro, went on to garner 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Performing on Wednesday night in Canandaigua, New York, the two broke out “Rock and Roll” for the first time together ― but with a completely different arrangement from the 1971 Zeppelin hit: “Rock and Roll” is from Led Zeppelin’s untitled fourth album, often simply called “Led Zeppelin IV.” Prior to embarking on the tour, Plant joked he now resembles the figure on the album’s cover: “I’m now that guy,” he said on his Digging Deep podcast in April. “I pick up kindling everywhere I go and wrap it around with a piece of baling twine and shunt it on my back just in case anybody’s driving by, and they go, ‘There’s that bloke off the ‘Led Zeppelin IV’ album cover!’” Plant and Krauss released their second album together last year, “Raise the Roof,” a long-awaited follow-up to 2007′s “Raising Sand,” which took home five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Here’s how Plant handled the song in concert nearly half a century ago with Zeppelin: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

0,Tony Awards 2022 Red Carpet: See The Best Looks On Broadway's Biggest Night,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Broadway’s biggest stars were ready to mark the end of a thrilling, if tumultuous, theater season in style at the 2022 Tony Awards. The 75th annual ceremony took place Sunday night at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. The show was hosted by Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar earlier this year for “West Side Story” and has an extensive background in musical theater. For many, the night was an unofficial celebration of the return of live theater following an unprecedented, 18-month closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the rebound was bumpier than anticipated, with several shows closing prematurely and others taking unusual measures to postpone or curtail performances to avoid a permanent closure. Even so, talent shone through. This year’s nominees include “A Strange Loop,” a musical which explores issues of Black queer identity, and “MJ: The Musical,” which charts Michael Jackson’s rise to fame through over 25 of his most beloved songs. Also nominated are “Six,” which reimagines the six wives of England’s Henry VIII as a female pop group, and the gender-reversed revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company.” As for plays, “The Lehman Trilogy” is a favorite to win big, while the gay-themed baseball drama “Take Me Out ” boasts a starry cast that includes actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jesse Williams, both of whom are nominated. Check out some of the best-dressed red carpet arrivals below. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Washington Post Adds Editor's Note To Amber Heard Op-Ed After Defamation Verdict,entertainment," Assignment editor, HuffPost The opinion piece at the center of the explosive Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial now bears an editor’s note stating that a court ruled the op-ed to be defamatory against Depp. The piece, headlined “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change” was published under Heard’s byline in 2018. It did not mention Depp, her ex-husband, by name. However, it was widely understood that her references to being abused were about their relationship. Depp sued Heard for defamation and on Wednesday, a Virginia court ruled primarily in his favor, finding that three statements in her op-ed were defamatory and awarding Depp $15 million in damages, though that amount was then capped at around $10 million due to state law. The next day, the Post affixed an editor’s note to the top of the op-ed outlining in detail which statements had been found defamatory: Editor’s note, June 2, 2022: In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation arising out of this 2018 op-ed. On June 1, 2022, following a trial in Fairfax County, Va. Circuit Court, a jury found Heard liable on three counts for the following statements, which Depp claimed were false and defamatory: (1) “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” (2) “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” (3) “I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.” The jury separately found that Depp, through his lawyer Adam Waldman, defamed Heard in one of three counts in her countersuit. Legal analyst Emily D. Baker told People it was a good decision to add a note, rather than removing the piece from its website. “Because this case is so watched and commented on, I think the op-ed is still needed for context,” she said. “I appreciate that they put up the notice rather than take the op-ed down. And I appreciate that they included, with specificity, exactly the statements that were found to be defamatory.” Though Depp won his case in the U.S., he lost in 2020 in the United Kingdom when he sued newspaper “The Sun” for calling him a “wife beater.” In that case, a judge found that Heard’s accusations of abuse were “substantially true” and that most of the violent incidents she alleged had been “proved to the civil standard.” Heard has said she plans to appeal the verdict in Depp’s suit against her.

2,"Keanu Reeves, Internet's Boyfriend, Still Going Strong With His Girlfriend, Pics Show",entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant’s excellent adventure appeared in full romantic swing Saturday at a museum event in Los Angeles. More than two years after the “John Wick” star and his artist girlfriend lovingly walked a museum red carpet together to essentially go public with their pairing, the two glowed on another tapis rouge at the 2022 MOCA Gala. They held hands while smiling and gazing into each other’s eyes. It all looked pretty lovey-dovey, don’t ya think? Reeves, sometimes known as “the Internet’s Boyfriend” for his good deeds and happy-go-lucky charm, came out to the world as attached at the November 2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala. He and Grant formed a friendship through art publishing circles and eventually co-founded the publishing house X Artists’ Books with designer Jessica Fleischmann. However, their romance extends well beyond their 2019 public appearance, according to actor Jennifer Tilly. She told Page Six in February 2020 that Grant suggested to her that she and Reeves were a couple at least a year and a half earlier. When the cameras clicked at the museum event, Grant recalled the stir they caused. “I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that’s fascinating,” she told Vogue in March 2020. “But the question I’ve been asking in all of this is: ‘What is the opportunity for good?’” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Rebel Wilson Reacts To Relationship With Girlfriend Nearly Being Exposed By Newspaper,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rebel Wilson’s relationship reveal last week was apparently in response to The Sydney Morning Herald telling her it planned to report she was dating a woman, something the actress later described as a “very hard situation.” On Thursday, the “Pitch Perfect” alum shared on Instagram that she was dating Romona Agruma, a fashion designer. “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” Wilson wrote. A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson) There was more to the story. Andrew Hornery, a columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, revealed soon after that the Australian newspaper had planned to report on her relationship, and that Wilson beat them to the punch. Hornery then published an opinion piece, which has since been removed from its site, saying the outlet had reached out out of “an abundance of caution and respect ... giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with another woman, LA leisure wear designer Ramona Agruma, before publishing a single word.” He continued, “Big mistake. Wilson opted to gazump the story, posting about her new ‘Disney Princess’ on Instagram early Friday morning, the same platform she had previously used to brag about her handsome ex-boyfriend, wealthy American beer baron Jacob Busch.” Hornery stated “who anyone dates is their business,” then pointed to Wilson’s previous relationships and the lack of need to conceal sexual orientation in society in today’s age. “This is understood to be Wilson’s first same-sex relationship, at age 42 and in an era when same-sex marriage is legal in many parts of the world and — thanks to decades of battling for equality — sexual orientation is no longer something to be hidden, even in Hollywood,” he wrote. Kate Doak, a journalist for the Australian network newscast 10 News First, noted on Twitter that Hornery had “admitted to giving [Wilson] a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ‘out’ her.” So apparently it wasn't @RebelWilson's choice to come out... The @smh/@theage  have admitted to giving her a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ""out"" her. What's worse, openly gay men at the Sydney Morning Herald were involved in this. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/Zl80zg01SW Wilson replied directly on Sunday. “Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace,” Wilson wrote. Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace 💗 In response to the outcry, Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields wrote that the newspaper “would have asked the same questions had Wilson’s new partner been a man.” “To say that the Herald ‘outed’ Wilson is wrong,” he wrote. “Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. I had made no decision about whether or what to publish.” Hornery has since published a column saying he “made mistakes” in his reporting and the tone of his column, noting he is gay and is “well aware of how deeply discrimination hurts.” “My email was never intended to be a threat but to make it clear I was sufficiently confident with my information and to open a conversation,” he wrote. “It is not the Herald’s business to ‘out’ people and that is not what we set out to do. But I understand why my email has been seen as a threat. The framing of it was a mistake.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"

Snoop first spilled the beans about hiring a personal blunt roller during an episode of “The Howard Stern Show” alongside Seth Rogen in 2019. “That motherfucker is like Lurch from the ‘Addams Family.’ ‘You rang?’” he laughed at the time, referring to his employee always being prepared whenever the entertainer was ready to light up.

0,Tony Awards 2022: The Complete Winners List,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost “A Strange Loop” and “The Lehman Trilogy” triumphed at the 75th Tony Awards on Sunday night, which marked the first ceremony celebrating musicals and plays that opened after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the theater industry to a halt. Returning to Radio City Music Hall in New York City after last year’s heavily delayed show, Broadway’s biggest night was officially back in full force with a glittering display of razzle dazzle. The four-hour broadcast aired live coast-to-coast across Paramount+ and CBS with “West Side Story” star and newly minted Oscar winner Ariana DeBose at the helm as host. “What a season it’s been,” Debose said at the start of the ceremony after a high-energy performance that pulled from classic Broadway shows of years past. “For many of you it’s been a roller coaster – starts, stops, dramatic twists and turns.” Michael R. Jackson’s autobiographical meta musical, “A Strange Loop,” which follows a Black queer composer writing a show about a Black queer composer, lead the pack with 11 nominations heading into the night. Ultimately, the show took home two of the most prestigious trophies in the Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical categories. “I wrote it at a time when I didn’t know what I was going to do with my life,” Jackson said on stage in his acceptance speech. “I didn’t know I was going to move forward. I felt unseen. I felt unheard. I felt misunderstood, and I just wanted to create a little bit of a life raft for myself as a Black gay man.” The award is the just the latest honor for Jackson, who previously won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for drama. While the show’s star Jaquel Spivey, who made his Broadway debut in the production, was expected to win the Best Acting prize, Myles Frost of “MJ: Musical” took home the honor in a surprise win. Casts from the five other nominated musicals ― “Girl from the North Country,” “MJ: The Musical” “Mr. Saturday Night,” “Paradise Square” and “Six” ― also performed at the ceremony, in addition to stars from “The Music Man” and the gender-swapped “Company.” The latter won Best Revival of a Musical and dual trophies in the acting categories for Patti Lupone and Matt Doyle among other awards. As for the plays, “The Lehman Trilogy,” a multi-generational tale about the rise and fall of the financial firm bearing the same name, secured the prize for Best Play, as well as trophies for director Sam Mendes and actor Simon Russell Beale. The gay baseball drama “Take Me Out” nabbed the award for Best Revival of a Play, while Jesse Tyler Ferguson was honored for his featured role in the show over his co-stars Jesse Williams and Michael Oberholtzer.

1,Mick Jagger Catches COVID-19; Rolling Stones Cancel Amsterdam Concert,entertainment," AMSTERDAM (AP) — The Rolling Stones canceled their concert in Amsterdam on Monday, just hours before it was due to start after lead singer Mick Jagger tested positive for COVID-19. The band announced the cancelation in a statement, saying the 78-year-old Jagger tested positive “after experiencing symptoms of COVID upon arrival at the stadium” on the outskirts of Amsterdam. There were no further details about his condition. “The Rolling Stones are deeply sorry for tonight’s postponement, but the safety of the audience, fellow musicians and the touring crew has to take priority,” the statement said, adding that the show would be rescheduled and tickets for the concert at Amsterdam’s Johan Cruyff Arena would be honored for the new date. Some fans were already in the stadium when it was announced that the show had been scrapped. The veteran rockers are touring Europe with a show called SIXTY to mark six decades together. Their last show was at Liverpool’s Anfield Stadium on June 9. The next scheduled concert is in Bern, Switzerland, on June 17. ___ Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic"
2,Kevin Spacey Due In London Court This Week To Face Sexual Offense Charges,entertainment," LONDON (AP) — Actor Kevin Spacey has been formally charged with sexual offenses against three men in Britain and is expected to appear in a court in London this week, British police said Monday. Spacey, 62, is accused of four counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. Spacey is due to appear at London’s Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday. The alleged incidents took place in London between March 2005 and August 2008, and one in western England in April 2013. The victims are now in their 30s and 40s. The Crown Prosecution Service authorized charges against Spacey last month. Spacey, a double Academy Award winner, was questioned by British police in 2019 about claims by several men that he had assaulted them. The former “House of Cards” star ran London’s Old Vic theater between 2004 and 2015. Spacey won a best supporting actor Academy Award for the 1995 film “The Usual Suspects” and a lead actor Oscar for the 1999 movie “American Beauty.” But his celebrated career came to an abrupt halt in 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused the star of assaulting him at a party in the 1980s, when Rapp was a teenager. Spacey denies the allegations."
3,John Stamos Calls Out Tonys For Excluding Bob Saget From In Memoriam Tribute,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost John Stamos was “disappointed” to find out that his friend Bob Saget was omitted from the “in memoriam” segment at the Tony Awards on Sunday. The “Full House” star was indeed missing from the tribute at the 75th annual ceremony, which remembered a slew of late stars, including Sidney Poitier, William Hurt, Stephen Sondheim and Joan Didion. Stamos apparently caught wind of the omission before the Tonys began, publicly calling on the awards show to “do the right thing” earlier in the afternoon. “Disappointed to hear that @bobsaget will be LEFT OUT of the In Memoriam segment tonight,” he tweeted, adding that Saget “was brilliant in The Drowsy Chaperone & Hand to God.” “Do the right thing! Bob loved Broadway and I know the community loved him,” Stamos wrote. Stamos then encouraged his followers to “make some noise” about the oversight, before sending support to hosts Ariana DeBose, Julianne Hough and Darren Criss, as well as the nominees. Disappointed to hear that @bobsaget will be LEFT OUT of the In Memoriam segment tonight @TheTonyawards. Bob was brilliant in The Drowsy Chaperone & Hand to God. Come on @BroadwayLeague and @TheWing ! Do the right thing! Bob loved Broadway and I know the community loved him. cont. Let’s make some noise about this everyone - and send our love and good wishes to the hosts @ArianaDeBose, @JulianneHough and my buddy @DarrenCriss and all the well-deserved nominees. While Saget was best known for his onscreen performances and stand-up comedy career, he made his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical “The Drowsy Chaperone” in 2007. Eight years later, he returned to the stage once again in “Hand To God” during the final two months of the show’s run. Representatives for the Tony Awards have yet to respond to Stamos’ request. Saget was found dead in his hotel room in Orlando, Florida, on Jan. 9 due to an apparent head trauma following a stand-up show in Jacksonville the night before. He was 65. Since his death, Stamos and his fellow “Full House” co-stars have kept his legacy alive. Many of them paid their respects to the comedian in Netflix’s recent special “Dirty Daddy: The Bob Saget Tribute.” “I’ve been saying that I’m not ready to say goodbye to him,” Stamos said in the special, which was filmed just weeks after Saget’s death. “It just doesn’t seem real to me ... I see him out there, still doing what he does best: I see him on that stage, killing it, another two-hour set.” “He gets a standing ovation, brings out his guitar, does one of his funny songs… gets an encore, another encore, another encore ... All of us would really like another encore from Bob tonight,” Stamos continued. Saget’s wife, Kelly Rizzo, also appeared in the special, alongside a slew of iconic comedians, including Jim Carrey, Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock, and stars John Mayer, Darren Criss and Seth Green. Everyone deserves a friend like Bob. Dirty Daddy: The Bob Saget Tribute streams June 10, only on Netflix. pic.twitter.com/HJiBJRNGfV Over the weekend, Rizzo accepted the Impact Award at the Critics Choice Real TV Awards on Saget’s behalf. Stamos appear at the ceremony to present the posthumous honor, celebrating on stage how Saget was successful in “every medium of media.” “A lot of colleagues ... were charmed by his humor, his intelligence, and his open expression of love for family, friends, and his fans. Known as a comedian’s comedian, he was both a family funny guy, and an aristocrat of dirty jokes,” Stamos said in his speech. “The outpouring tributes from the filthiest comments to grandmothers in the Midwest showed just the range of audience that he had adoring him.” He added, “Fortunately, his legacy lives in my life. The guy taught me how to love deeply, fully allowed me to find such joy and such gratitude in my marriage and my father.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,"Tony Siragusa, Former NFL Star, Dead At 55",entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

DeBose donned a stunning, all-white ensemble inspired by Michael Jackson, the subject of “MJ: The Musical,” which received 10 nominations heading into the evening. “Let’s just say, for many of you it’s been a rollercoaster,” DeBose remarked in her opening monologue, noting how the coronavirus pandemic has upended the theater industry over the past two years. Now THAT is how you kick off the #TonyAwards! 👏 We give our round of applause right back to @ArianaDeBose. pic.twitter.com/fybuEJ0agQ “I am so proud that the theater is becoming more reflective of the community who adores it, and in doing so, has gained new performers, new creatives, new fans,” she continued. “It has shown us stories that have broadened our world and opened our hearts and our minds.” “And while we have not solved all of our problems, I feel like the phrase ‘Great White Way’ is becoming more of a nickname as opposed to a how-to guide.” Earlier this week, DeBose, who recently became the first openly queer woman of color to win an Academy Award for her work as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake, took to Instagram to share her excitement leading up to her hosting debut. “Ran into these two at rehearsal today. They’re cookin up something good for the @thetonyawards pre-show,” she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo with Tony Awards pre-show hosts Darren Criss and Julianne Hough.

11,Rebel Wilson Reacts To Relationship With Girlfriend Nearly Being Exposed By Newspaper,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Rebel Wilson’s relationship reveal last week was apparently in response to The Sydney Morning Herald telling her it planned to report she was dating a woman, something the actress later described as a “very hard situation.” On Thursday, the “Pitch Perfect” alum shared on Instagram that she was dating Romona Agruma, a fashion designer. “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” Wilson wrote. A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson) There was more to the story. Andrew Hornery, a columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, revealed soon after that the Australian newspaper had planned to report on her relationship, and that Wilson beat them to the punch. Hornery then published an opinion piece, which has since been removed from its site, saying the outlet had reached out out of “an abundance of caution and respect ... giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with another woman, LA leisure wear designer Ramona Agruma, before publishing a single word.” He continued, “Big mistake. Wilson opted to gazump the story, posting about her new ‘Disney Princess’ on Instagram early Friday morning, the same platform she had previously used to brag about her handsome ex-boyfriend, wealthy American beer baron Jacob Busch.” Hornery stated “who anyone dates is their business,” then pointed to Wilson’s previous relationships and the lack of need to conceal sexual orientation in society in today’s age. “This is understood to be Wilson’s first same-sex relationship, at age 42 and in an era when same-sex marriage is legal in many parts of the world and — thanks to decades of battling for equality — sexual orientation is no longer something to be hidden, even in Hollywood,” he wrote. Kate Doak, a journalist for the Australian network newscast 10 News First, noted on Twitter that Hornery had “admitted to giving [Wilson] a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ‘out’ her.” So apparently it wasn't @RebelWilson's choice to come out... The @smh/@theage  have admitted to giving her a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to ""out"" her. What's worse, openly gay men at the Sydney Morning Herald were involved in this. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/Zl80zg01SW Wilson replied directly on Sunday. “Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace,” Wilson wrote. Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace 💗 In response to the outcry, Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields wrote that the newspaper “would have asked the same questions had Wilson’s new partner been a man.” “To say that the Herald ‘outed’ Wilson is wrong,” he wrote. “Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. I had made no decision about whether or what to publish.” Hornery has since published a column saying he “made mistakes” in his reporting and the tone of his column, noting he is gay and is “well aware of how deeply discrimination hurts.” “My email was never intended to be a threat but to make it clear I was sufficiently confident with my information and to open a conversation,” he wrote. “It is not the Herald’s business to ‘out’ people and that is not what we set out to do. But I understand why my email has been seen as a threat. The framing of it was a mistake.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Tony Awards 2022 Red Carpet: See The Best Looks On Broadway's Biggest Night,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Broadway’s biggest stars were ready to mark the end of a thrilling, if tumultuous, theater season in style at the 2022 Tony Awards. The 75th annual ceremony took place Sunday night at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. The show was hosted by Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar earlier this year for “West Side Story” and has an extensive background in musical theater. For many, the night was an unofficial celebration of the return of live theater following an unprecedented, 18-month closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the rebound was bumpier than anticipated, with several shows closing prematurely and others taking unusual measures to postpone or curtail performances to avoid a permanent closure. Even so, talent shone through. This year’s nominees include “A Strange Loop,” a musical which explores issues of Black queer identity, and “MJ: The Musical,” which charts Michael Jackson’s rise to fame through over 25 of his most beloved songs. Also nominated are “Six,” which reimagines the six wives of England’s Henry VIII as a female pop group, and the gender-reversed revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company.” As for plays, “The Lehman Trilogy” is a favorite to win big, while the gay-themed baseball drama “Take Me Out ” boasts a starry cast that includes actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jesse Williams, both of whom are nominated.

13,Washington Post Adds Editor's Note To Amber Heard Op-Ed After Defamation Verdict,entertainment," Assignment editor, HuffPost The opinion piece at the center of the explosive Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial now bears an editor’s note stating that a court ruled the op-ed to be defamatory against Depp. The piece, headlined “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change” was published under Heard’s byline in 2018. It did not mention Depp, her ex-husband, by name. However, it was widely understood that her references to being abused were about their relationship. Depp sued Heard for defamation and on Wednesday, a Virginia court ruled primarily in his favor, finding that three statements in her op-ed were defamatory and awarding Depp $15 million in damages, though that amount was then capped at around $10 million due to state law. The next day, the Post affixed an editor’s note to the top of the op-ed outlining in detail which statements had been found defamatory: Editor’s note, June 2, 2022: In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation arising out of this 2018 op-ed. On June 1, 2022, following a trial in Fairfax County, Va. Circuit Court, a jury found Heard liable on three counts for the following statements, which Depp claimed were false and defamatory: (1) “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” (2) “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” (3) “I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.” The jury separately found that Depp, through his lawyer Adam Waldman, defamed Heard in one of three counts in her countersuit. Legal analyst Emily D. Baker told People it was a good decision to add a note, rather than removing the piece from its website. “Because this case is so watched and commented on, I think the op-ed is still needed for context,” she said. “I appreciate that they put up the notice rather than take the op-ed down. And I appreciate that they included, with specificity, exactly the statements that were found to be defamatory.” Though Depp won his case in the U.S., he lost in 2020 in the United Kingdom when he sued newspaper “The Sun” for calling him a “wife beater.” In that case, a judge found that Heard’s accusations of abuse were “substantially true” and that most of the violent incidents she alleged had been “proved to the civil standard.” Heard has said she plans to appeal the verdict in Depp’s suit against her.

14,"Keanu Reeves, Internet's Boyfriend, Still Going Strong With His Girlfriend, Pics Show",entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant’s excellent adventure appeared in full romantic swing Saturday at a museum event in Los Angeles. More than two years after the “John Wick” star and his artist girlfriend lovingly walked a museum red carpet together to essentially go public with their pairing, the two glowed on another tapis rouge at the 2022 MOCA Gala. They held hands while smiling and gazing into each other’s eyes. It all looked pretty lovey-dovey, don’t ya think? Reeves, sometimes known as “the Internet’s Boyfriend” for his good deeds and happy-go-lucky charm, came out to the world as attached at the November 2019 LACMA Art + Film Gala. He and Grant formed a friendship through art publishing circles and eventually co-founded the publishing house X Artists’ Books with designer Jessica Fleischmann. However, their romance extends well beyond their 2019 public appearance, according to actor Jennifer Tilly. She told Page Six in February 2020 that Grant suggested to her that she and Reeves were a couple at least a year and a half earlier. When the cameras clicked at the museum event, Grant recalled the stir they caused. “I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that’s fascinating,” she told Vogue in March 2020. “But the question I’ve been asking in all of this is: ‘What is the opportunity for good?’” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Britney Spears' Ex Jason Alexander Arrested Trying To Crash Her Wedding To Sam Asghari,entertainment," Assignment editor, HuffPost Britney Spears’ ex-husband partook in some truly toxic behavior on Thursday, crashing the preparations for the pop star’s wedding to Sam Asghari. Jason Alexander (no connection to the “Seinfeld” actor) live-streamed the bizarre incident on Instagram from Spears’ property in Thousand Oaks, California, where the wedding was reportedly slated to take place later in the day. In the videos, he can be heard asking, “Where’s Britney at?” and saying he’s there to “crash the wedding” but also claiming that Spears invited him. At other points, he says of Spears, “She’s my first wife, my only wife” and refers to the planned nuptials as a “bullshit wedding.” Police responded to a call of trespassing at the property, TMZ was the first to report. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department told NBC News it had arrested Alexander on suspicion of an outstanding felony warrant from 2016. Spears and Alexander were childhood friends who married in 2004, but the marriage was annulled after 55 hours. She later married Kevin Federline, with whom she has two children. Spears and Asghari announced their engagement in September after dating for four years. They shared the news not long after her father, Jamie Spears, had filed documents to end the conservatorship that had controlled most of the pop star’s personal and professional life for more than a decade.

Spears and Asghari tied the knot at her home in Thousand Oaks, California ― but not without some early drama. Her first husband Jason Alexander (not the “Seinfeld” actor) attempted to parlay their 55-hour marriage in 2004 into an attention-grabbing stunt on Thursday. He tried to crash the wedding preparations on her property while live-streaming his alleged trespass. He was arrested on an outstanding warrant. General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
2,"Writer Claims 'Fire Island' Fails The Bechdel Test, And Twitter Users Have Thoughts",entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The stars of Hulu’s “Fire Island” found themselves at the center of a social media frenzy this week after a writer argued that the LGBTQ-inclusive romantic comedy didn’t accurately represent women. Directed by Andrew Ahn, “Fire Island” is a contemporary reimagining of Jane Austen’s “Pride & Prejudice.” The film stars Joel Kim Booster (who also wrote the screenplay) and Bowen Yang as two friends who embark on a group vacation to the Pines, a section of Fire Island, New York, known as a mecca for the LGBTQ community. Flirtation and drama ensue after the guys catch the eye of two significantly wealthier men, played by actors Conrad Ricamora and James Scully. Catch the “Fire Island” trailer above. On Monday, writer Hanna Rosin tweeted that “Fire Island” failed to pass the Bechdel test, an unofficial and nonscientific metric used to judge films on whether they feature at least two female characters who talk to each other about something other than their relationships to men. “[‘Fire Island’] gets an F- on the Bechdel test in a whole new way,” wrote Rosin, who is the author of 2013’s “The End of Men: And the Rise of Women” and the editorial director for audio at New York Magazine. “Do we just ignore the drab lesbian stereotypes bc cute gay Asian boys? Is this revenge for all those years of the gay boy best friend?” Rosin’s since-deleted tweet was met with backlash. Many fans took issue with the fact that she singled out “Fire Island,” which has been otherwise praised for its exclusively LGBTQ cast that includes many actors of color. Others felt her use of the term “cute gay Asian boys” to be condescending toward Booster, Ricamora and Yang. I loved FIRE ISLAND, even though it wasn’t “for” me or “about” me and apparently doesn’t pass the Bechdel test. Crazy, I know. I haven’t seen #FireIslandMovie but can we not do this, please? This movie features several queer Asian men — who are vastly underrepresented in media and shown only as flat, stereotypical, supporting characters when sporadically present — as complex and nuanced leads. https://t.co/j5pLst4Hdu Before long, Rosin’s tweet caught the eye of comedian Margaret Cho, who has a supporting role in the film and is bisexual. “I didn’t realize I was drab,” she tweeted. “I don’t identify as drab. Bitch I’m fab!” Alison Bechdel, the award-winning cartoonist who developed the Bechdel test, also chimed in, tweeting that she was amending her criteria specifically in response to the film. Okay, I just added a corollary to the Bechdel test: Two men talking to each other about the female protagonist of an Alice Munro story in a screenplay structured on a Jane Austen novel = pass. #FireIsland #BechdelTest By Tuesday afternoon, Rosin deleted her tweet and offered a lengthy apology. I deleted a tweet that many of you rightly pointed out was offensive. I’ve read your responses and I hear you. My tweet was careless and thoughtless. Truly. The movie was telling a story about queer AAPI men, whose experiences don’t show up enough in movies or anywhere else 1/3 pic.twitter.com/FEI0sDqXJe “What I had to say was beside the point, not to mention a buzzkill on a fun summer movie,” she continued. “It’s a cliche but the fact that I didn’t see it coming means I have a lot to learn. ... The last thing I want to do is pit members of my community against each other. I sincerely apologize to those who were hurt by my words.” Rosin’s criticisms aside, “Fire Island” has received mostly positive reviews, with Ahn telling Gay Times he’d be on board with a sequel. “I think, for me, there’s something really special about that group of friends, both as characters and also as people,” he said. “I really hope that we get to hang out again and at the very least, maybe we can actually just go on vacation and not have to make a movie while we’re doing it.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

(Watch the video below.) As long as the host and the “Circles” singer were downing beers, shots, ridiculously named cocktails and Malone’s own brand of rosé for a nationally televised talk show, getting drunk might as well become the mission. It’s entertaining, it’s relatable and it allows for hooch product placement, whether intended or not. So just watch the two get good and tanked, see them play fake trivia games as an excuse to guzzle more spirits and let Malone not quite impress while drawing tattoos on Meyers’ face. The segment ends with a “Cheers” chaser ― but you’ll have to watch to find out what it is. All in all, these drinking buddies are definitely worth a round or two of your attention.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks.

7,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
9,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes.

More than 800 people have been arrested for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, carried out by supporters of former President Donald Trump in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Thursday’s hearing laid out how Trump and members of his inner circle executed the “conspiracy” to hold on to power. “This is a new experience for a lot of these white people. You know, all of a sudden they’re finding out what it’s like to be on the bad side of the police and it turns out, they do not like it one bit,” Noah quipped. He illustrated his point with a sketch, in which two “Trump supporters” spoke about their plight. “As a Trump supporter in America, you already know that cops treat people like us differently.

11,'Jurassic World: Dominion' Stomps Out The Competition At The Box Office,entertainment," Move over Maverick, the dinosaurs have arrived to claim their throne. “Jurassic World: Dominion” took a mighty bite out of the box office with $143.4 million in North American ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Including earnings from international showings — the film opened in various markets last weekend — “Jurassic World: Dominion,” released globally by Universal Pictures, has already grossed $389 million. And it’s just getting started. “We couldn’t be happier,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s head of domestic distribution. “‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ had a very broad and ridiculously enthusiastic audience.” The hefty haul is yet another sign that the box office is continuing to rebound this summer. With the blockbuster successes of films like “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and now “Jurassic World 3,” audiences are coming back to movie theaters more consistently. The film, which had a reported $185 million price tag not accounting for marketing and promotion costs, opened on 4,676 screens in the U.S. and Canada, starting with preview showings Thursday. Audiences were 56% male and 54% over the age of 25, according to Universal. Critics were not kind to the dino extravaganza, but audiences seem to be enjoying themselves based on exit polls. Moviegoers gave it an A- CinemaScore and an 81% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, suggesting that word of mouth will be strong in the coming weeks. “You want to see dinosaurs on the big screen, it doesn’t matter what critics thought,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. And many moviegoers did opt for the biggest screens possible. Globally, IMAX showings of “Jurassic World: Dominion” represented $25 million of the total. The 3D format also accounted for around 25% of worldwide ticket sales. “The appetite for the colossal creatures in this franchise is still voracious, and the way audiences want to experience this movie is in 3D,” said Travis Reid, the CEO and president of Cinema for RealD, in a statement. Both “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Jurassic World: Dominion” are an important caveat for an industry that continues to learn new lessons about pandemic-era moviegoing every week. Although both films are legacy sequels, neither are of the superhero variety, which, for a long time, had seemed like the only pandemic-proof genre. “Top Gun: Maverick” is still coasting in rarefied skies too: It fell only 44% in its third weekend with an estimated $50 million to take second place, bringing its North American total north of $393.3 million. “Doctor Strange 2,” in its sixth weekend, was a distant third with $4.9 million. This weekend is only the third of the pandemic era in which the total domestic box office surpassed $200 million, according to box office tracker Comscore. The others were “Spider Man: No Way Home,” in December, and “Doctor Strange 2,” in May. But this is the first time there has been space for two movies to do well. “Pretty much all the big blockbuster weekends that we’ve had over the pandemic have been dominated by one movie,” Dergarabedian said. “In this case, we have two big blockbusters in theaters at once. This is the recipe for success that theater owners have been waiting for over the course of the pandemic. It’s an important milestone.” “Dominion,” a co-production of Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment, is the third film in the “Jurassic World” trilogy, which began in 2015 and introduced characters played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. The newest installment brings back actors Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum from Steven Spielberg’s 1993 “Jurassic Park.” Colin Trevorrow, who stewarded the “World” trilogy and directed the first film, returned to direct “Dominion,” in which dinosaurs are no longer contained and locusts are threatening the world’s food supply. The filmmakers have said “Dominion” is intended to be the last of the “Jurassic World” films, which have been enormously profitable with over $3 billion in ticket sales. The first earned over $1.7 billion globally alone. Including the original “Jurassic Park” trilogy, that number skyrockets to $5 billion. “Jurassic World 3” should continue performing throughout the summer, Orr said. Universal Pictures also has a number of diverse, high-profile and theatrical-only releases coming in the next few weeks, including the horror film “The Black Phone,” “Minions: The Rise of Gru” and Jordan Peele’s “Nope.” And this vote of confidence in movie theaters is promising. “This is a tremendous start to our summer,” Orr said. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Jurassic World: Dominion,” $143.4 million. 2. “Top Gun: Maverick,” $50 million. 3. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” $4.9 million. 4. “The Bob’s Burgers Movie,” $2.3 million. 5. “The Bad Guys,” $2.3 million. 6. “Downton Abbey: A New Era,” $1.7 million. 7. “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” $1.3 million. 8. “Firestarter,” $820,000. 9. “Sonic the Hedgehog 2,” $710,000. 10. “Ante Sundaraniki,” $620,000."
12,Rebel Wilson Finds Love With A Woman She Calls Her 'Disney Princess',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rebel Wilson has found love with a woman she refers to as her “Disney Princess.” The “Pitch Perfect” star announced she is in a same-sex relationship on Thursday with an Instagram post featuring her and her girlfriend, fashion designer Ramona Agruma. “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince … but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” the 42-year-old actor wrote. Wilson alluded to her new relationship last month when speaking with People.com, but didn’t specify her partner’s gender, saying only that they met “through a friend” and “spoke on the phone for weeks before meeting.” She added that it “was a really good way to get to know each other. It was a bit old-school in that sense — very romantic.” Although Wilson hadn’t previously announced her new love was a woman, she said the big difference in the relationship compared to her past ones is that “it’s great to have someone who feels like an equal partner and be in a healthy relationship.” She explained further: “There were times — I’m not saying with all my exes, they’re great — but there were some times that I was probably putting up with that I shouldn’t have. So it feels different to be in a really healthy relationship.” A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson) Wilson’s last public relationship before Agruma was with Jacob Busch, a member of the family that founded the Anheuser-Busch brewing company; they split in February. Agruma owns a sustainable clothing brand called Lemon Ve Limon based in Los Angeles, and, like Wilson, attended law school, according to InTouch Weekly. Wilson may not have publicly revealed she was dating Agruma until Thursday, but the designer has been the actor’s plus-one at many recent events. Page Six notes that Agruma accompanied the actor to the Oscars in March. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
13,'Ms. Marvel' Is A Turning Point For Muslim American Visibility In Hollywood,entertainment," Contributor In 2014, Marvel Comics introduced a new character that quickly became an international sensation. Unlike Thanos from the planet Titan or Dr. Strange, who wielded the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme, this young phenom was the product of a regular Muslim American family living in New Jersey. Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel, possessed the coveted superpower of shapeshifting. But other than that, she was just a quirky high school kid navigating her blended identity. Many of my Muslim American peers and I were amazed by what finally appeared to be a positive and fun, yet powerful, representation of our community. Khan’s infectious charm and steadfast strength slayed her nemeses in vivid color through the pages, her character unapologetically bucking the negative stereotypes impressed upon Muslim Americans. Eight years later, we’re on the cusp of another groundbreaking milestone: the long-anticipated release of the Disney+ adaptation of the comic, with Iman Vellani playing Kamala Khan. On the show, the cosmic Ms. Marvel fights to protect the streets of Jersey City as she grapples with everyday coming-of-age challenges. A female Muslim superhero is a rather satisfying herald of progress — both for Hollywood diversity and Muslim visibility in general. The casting feels right, for once. Vellani lives out her character’s family dynamics at home to a T — and they feel familiar and even comforting. At school, she’s just trying to figure it all out. But the streets and her imagination are where the magic happens. In the trailer for the series (only one episode has dropped so far), she’s all at once tender, reverent and explosive. Khan’s range is meaningful not just for all the brown girls out there trying to save the world, but for everyone who’s never felt totally seen. In an attempt at diversity, Marvel has shaken up its repertoire of box office-slaying superheroes in recent years, launching successful film franchises around the Black Panther or Shang-Chi. Yet, there’s still a lot of work to be done and “Ms. Marvel” feels like another step in the right direction. It’s not enough to be included on-screen; Our communities have to be represented in various ways to reflect our realities. There are currently 3.5 million Muslim-identifying people in the U.S. and Islam has been deemed the world’s fastest-growing religion, but it’s safe to say that Muslim characters are often monolithic when portrayed in Hollywood. If represented at all, Muslim characters are negatively stereotyped and/or relegated to a supporting role with no backstory, according to research from USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, a leading think tank addressing inequality in entertainment. While Muslims are one of the most racially and socially diverse religious groups, their existences are all too often expressed by one-dimensional narratives associated with terrorism and orientalist tropes of oppression. Muslim American women face even larger hurdles around visibility. Fewer than one quarter of Muslim characters depicted in global movies are women. This type of gender erasure further amplifies what Dr. Stacey L. Smith, the founding director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, calls an “epidemic of invisibility.” This is one of the reasons “Ms. Marvel” feels necessary. According to Marvel, show co-creator and executive producer Sana Amanat was inspired in part by her life experiences to take the hand of the average American viewer and introduce them to their Muslim American neighbors through an ultra-familiar vehicle: the modern teenager. The series, which includes predominantly Muslim and South Asian talent on and off-screen, emphasizes strong character relatability by showcasing a universally-accessible teenage experience while advancing a wholesome storyline around Muslim families. It colorfully serves as a mirror for young adults to see an empowering reflection of themselves. “‘Ms. Marvel’ is going to inspire generations of Muslims as well as bring understanding to so many others while connecting both groups in ways that are much needed today,” Khalid Latif, executive director and chaplain for the Islamic Center at New York University, told me. The unfortunate reality is that Hollywood is a hugely risk-averse business that has too often churned out formulaic stories. Yet, films such as “Black Panther” and “Crazy Rich Asians” have demonstrated the profitability of diversity and inclusion, generating staggering revenues for film studios. A recent study from the UCLA-based Center for Scholars and Storytellers found that major Hollywood films lacking diversity within their cast and crew more often result in significant box office losses than those with diverse, authentic cast representation. “With ‘Ms. Marvel’ tapping into international talent, there is an even significant potential to create a robust and an authentic ecosystem that can resonate with audiences globally and extend visibility into future series and other media crossovers,” says Serena Rasoul, founder of Muslim Casting, an agency that casts and consults for Muslim and SWANA talent. Khan’s character expansion cross-media also serves as a model in investing in more diverse storylines about young, Muslim Americans. Kamala Khan lives out the vulnerabilities I felt as a teenager as well as the ones I experience today as I continue to navigate my sense of self. That said, the series has something to offer for everyone. It’s a moment to collectively recognize our humanity and boundless empathy. It gives us all a sense of belonging in a time we need it the most. Perhaps most importantly, “Ms. Marvel” proves that the greatest superpower of all could just be relatability. Contributor"
14,Justin Bieber Battling Virus That Has Paralyzed Half His Face,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Justin Bieber announced Friday that he is taking some time off from touring in order to deal with a virus that has paralyzed half his face. In a video posted on Instagram, the singer explained that he’s postponed several shows after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a condition that has affected a nerve in his ear. As a result, he’s unable to blink his right eye and can smile only on the left side of his face. “This nostril will not move,” he added. As a result, Bieber said, he’s “physically unable” to perform in concert for the time being. Instead, he will “rest and relax” until he’s able “to do what I was born to do.” Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs when the varicella-zoster virus ― which also causes chicken pox and shingles ― infects a nerve in the head. Treatment often involves steroids and/or antiviral medicines. Bieber didn’t say if he was taking medicine. However, he said he’s doing “all these facial exercises” to get his face back to normal. He added that he doesn’t know how long that will take. You can see the complete video selfie below. A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) This has been a rough year healthwise for Bieber and his wife, Hailey. In February, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after the opening night of his world tour, and his wife suffered a blood clot in her brain the next month. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Ariana DeBose Kicks Off 2022 Tony Awards With Show-Stopping Broadway Mashup,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost “West Side Story” star Ariana DeBose launched the 75th Tony Awards in style with a breathtaking mashup performance featuring tunes from classic Tony-winning musicals, including “Phantom of the Opera,” “Cabaret,” “Hair” and “Company.” The former Tony nominee opened the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall on Sunday night with an energetic performance, giving a “round of applause” to everyone on Broadway. DeBose donned a stunning, all-white ensemble inspired by Michael Jackson, the subject of “MJ: The Musical,” which received 10 nominations heading into the evening. “Let’s just say, for many of you it’s been a rollercoaster,” DeBose remarked in her opening monologue, noting how the coronavirus pandemic has upended the theater industry over the past two years. Now THAT is how you kick off the #TonyAwards! 👏 We give our round of applause right back to @ArianaDeBose. pic.twitter.com/fybuEJ0agQ “I am so proud that the theater is becoming more reflective of the community who adores it, and in doing so, has gained new performers, new creatives, new fans,” she continued. “It has shown us stories that have broadened our world and opened our hearts and our minds.” “And while we have not solved all of our problems, I feel like the phrase ‘Great White Way’ is becoming more of a nickname as opposed to a how-to guide.” Earlier this week, DeBose, who recently became the first openly queer woman of color to win an Academy Award for her work as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake, took to Instagram to share her excitement leading up to her hosting debut. “Ran into these two at rehearsal today. They’re cookin up something good for the @thetonyawards pre-show,” she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo with Tony Awards pre-show hosts Darren Criss and Julianne Hough. A post shared by Ariana DeBose (@arianadebose) Alongside DeBose’s powerful performance, the evening also featured performances from the casts of “A Strange Loop,” “Paradise Square,” “SIX,” “Company,” “Girl from the North Country,” “MJ,” “Mr. Saturday Night” and “Music Man.” Bernadette Peters, Billy Porter, the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus and the original cast of “Spring Awakening” also hit the stage with individual performances.

A post shared by Cooper Noriega (@cooper.noriega) Law enforcement sources told TMZ that Noriega was discovered unconscious in a mall parking lot outside Los Angeles on Thursday. A passerby called 911 and paramedics were quick to arrive, but they were unable to revive Noriega. Hours before his death, Noriega posted a TikTok while lying in bed with the caption, “who else b thinking they gon d!€ young af.” or dis j me Noriega’s last TikTok was a duet with Bryce Hall. Hall commented, “I love you so much,” on the post. Earlier this week, Noriega published a post on Instagram in which he announced he started a Discord account called “Coop’s Advice” to “create a space built on spreading awareness and normalizing talking about mental illness.” He also opened up about his struggles with addiction that started when he was 9 years old. “My goal is to eventually open a rehab where people aren’t traumatized at the end of their recovery, and where the staff meetings are trusted people. One of the many things I’ve learnt while struggling with addiction was that surrounding yourself with negative people will only bring you down,” he wrote. A post shared by Cooper Noriega (@cooper.noriega) “My heart hurts,” social media star Blake Gray wrote in the comments section of Noriega’s above Instagram post. “It doesn’t feel real.

1,"Lady Gaga In Talks To Join 'Joker' Sequel, Which For Some Reason Will Be A Musical",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Lady Gaga might have met her method acting match in Joaquin Phoenix. Just when the swarms of flies had stopped following the pop star after her equal parts bizarre and hilarious “House of Gucci” press tour, she’s considering a dive even deeper into another role for the much-anticipated “Joker” sequel. The Oscar-winning “A Star Is Born” actor is in talks to play Harley Quinn in the follow-up to director Todd Phillips’ box-office smash about the maniacal Batman villain, according to multiple outlets. The sequel won’t contain just laughs, but songs, too, as the film will reportedly be a musical. But it will likely be a while before Gaga and Phoenix start two-stepping down a flight of stairs, as the project is still early in the development stage. Phoenix, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the titular baddie, has yet to officially sign on to the film, per The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that Warner Bros. is “deep into” negotiations with the star. Phillips officially confirmed that a “Joker” sequel was a go earlier this month. The director shared a cryptic Instagram post showing the cover page of a script titled “Joker: Folie à Deux” alongside a photo of Phoenix reading the material. A post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips) The title loosely translates into English as “shared psychosis” and seemingly refers to a mental disorder “affecting two or more individuals, usually the members of a close family.” Phillips, who produced Gaga’s “A Star Is Born” remake, will once again direct and write the script alongside Scott Silver. Gaga would be the latest performer to step into Harley Quinn’s laced pumps, as Margot Robbie has portrayed the character in multiple films to much acclaim, most recently appearing in 2020’s “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).” Kaley Cuoco voices the psychiatrist-turned-henchwoman in HBO Max’s animated series “Harley Quinn.” “Joker,” however, takes place in a separate universe from the recent slate of DC superhero films, so the musical follow-up won’t step on any toes should Robbie choose to reprise the role. Despite a relatively modest $60 million budget, the gritty origin story of the supervillian raked in more than $1 billion at the box office, becoming the first R-rated film to reach the milestone. “Joker,” which also starred Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy and Robert De Niro, went on to garner 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.

2,Me Too Founder Reacts To Depp-Heard Trial Verdict,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Activist Tarana Burke spoke up Thursday to defend the Me Too movement she created after a jury sided largely with actor Johnny Depp in his defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Some commenters on social media reacted to the verdict by saying that it had sounded the death knell for the movement, sparked by a viral hashtag in 2017 when women in Hollywood began accusing producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Burke had been working to support sexual assault survivors since 2005, using the phrase “me too” to emphasize the pervasive nature of intimate partner violence. “#MeToo is dead. Helluva job @ACLU,” Meghan McCain said Wednesday in a now-deleted tweet. “The ‘me too’ movement isn’t dead, this system is dead,” Burke wrote in a statement. “This is the same legal system that y’all have been relying on for justice and accountability for decades to no avail.” A jury of five male and two female Virginians unanimously decided that Heard had defamed her ex-husband with the publication of a 2018 editorial stating she had been abused by Depp during their rocky relationship, although the piece did not explicitly name him. The jurors said Heard acted with “actual malice,” meaning that they believed she knew what she was writing was false. The panel wanted Heard to pay Depp a total of $15 million in damages, but Judge Penney Azcarate lowered the amount slightly to $10.35 million in accordance with state laws on financial penalties. In the wake of the verdict, some legal experts have said U.S. courts that rely on juries of regular people are not set up to fairly weigh questions about intimate partner violence, given how they can be swayed by misconceptions and emotion. Burke continued her message: “When you get the verdict you want, ‘the movement works’ ― when you don’t, it’s dead. When Weinstein went to jail it was, ‘me too is winning!’ When Cosby came home it was, ‘What a blow, me too is losing!’ In the meantime ― millions of people who have never been able to utter the words ‘it happened to me’ have released the shame that wasn’t theirs to carry in the first place, we have built the country’s first political agenda created solely by Survivors, and for the first time since Anita Hill took the stand three decades ago we’ve had a sustained national dialogue about, not just sexual harassment, but the spectrum of sexual violence in this country. That’s in addition to various laws and policies passed, etc. This movement is very much ALIVE. You all want to play ping pong and have your way with the hashtag because it doesn’t mean anything to you so you try to kill it every few months. But it means something to millions and millions of folks. It means freedom. It means community. It means safety. It means power. You can’t kill us. We are beyond the hashtag. We are a movement.” Many advocates for survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault also worried that the ferocity with which Depp’s fans discussed Heard online ― combined with the highly publicized nature of the trial ― would discourage other women from coming forward with their stories. More than six weeks of proceedings were streamed live online. While the jury was told not to read about the case, they were also not sequestered. pic.twitter.com/bbciGgjgUA Reporter, HuffPost"
3,James Patterson Once Spotted A Woman Stealing One Of His Books,entertainment,"  Bestselling author James Patterson once spotted a woman checking out one of his earliest novels ― and then she booked out of the store without paying for it. Patterson, who has since sold over 400 million books, said that particular novel was on The New York Times Best Seller list but he didn’t believe it. So he was thrilled to see the woman pick up his book, glance at the back and walk away with it. “This is the best, I want to go hug this woman,” Patterson told Seth Meyers on “Late Night” Wednesday. “She puts it in her bag, she stole it. And all I’m going is: ‘Does that count as a sale?’” Patterson released his latest book ― a self-titled memoir ― on Monday. Watch the rest of his interview below: "
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort.

9,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"

On Tuesday, the iconic rapper revealed on Twitter that he gave his full-time blunt roller a raise due to inflation.

Performing on Wednesday night in Canandaigua, New York, the two broke out “Rock and Roll” for the first time together ― but with a completely different arrangement from the 1971 Zeppelin hit: “Rock and Roll” is from Led Zeppelin’s untitled fourth album, often simply called “Led Zeppelin IV.” Prior to embarking on the tour, Plant joked he now resembles the figure on the album’s cover: “I’m now that guy,” he said on his Digging Deep podcast in April. “I pick up kindling everywhere I go and wrap it around with a piece of baling twine and shunt it on my back just in case anybody’s driving by, and they go, ‘There’s that bloke off the ‘Led Zeppelin IV’ album cover!’” Plant and Krauss released their second album together last year, “Raise the Roof,” a long-awaited follow-up to 2007′s “Raising Sand,” which took home five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Here’s how Plant handled the song in concert nearly half a century ago with Zeppelin: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
15,Cole Sprouse's Naked Butt Is All It's Cracked Up To Be In Goofy Instagram,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost “Riverdale” star Cole Sprouse on Tuesday cracked wise in sharing a mirror selfie of his butt. “Good morning to my publicity team,” the actor joked in his Instagram caption. A post shared by Cole Sprouse (@colesprouse) The cheeky star’s derriere appeared to be digitally altered. But whatever the case, the actor who plays Jughead on the CW series got plenty of love from co-stars, not to mention millions of views worldwide. His former “Riverdale” dad, Skeet Ulrich, posted several laughing emojis, and Mark Consuelos, who played the town villain Hiram Lodge, wrote simply, “Yo.” “Hate to see you go, love to watch you leave 😪,” “Scream” star Mason Gooding wrote. The wiseass post should come as no surprise, given Sprouse’s distaste for people who dispense too much information online. “People who share all of their personal life on social media. Those people genuinely scare me,” Sprouse told Interview Magazine recently. “I’m firmly convinced that any form of social media is a performance. People who are willing to perform every aspect of their life there are truly a terrifying breed.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

1,"BTS Announce They’re Taking Time Off, Indicate Burnout",entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost It’s the end of an era … maybe? K-Pop superstars BTS — a group that includes RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — announced Tuesday that they would be taking time off to grow individually in a video posted to social media. “To be clear, they are not on hiatus but will take time to explore some solo projects at this time and remain active in various different formats,” a rep for the band told HuffPost via email. In the video, members of the band didn’t mention how long the break would last, but Jungkook said that they plan to return, per a HuffPost translation. The “Butter” singers indicated that they’d like to grow as individuals, take some time to mature and also work on solo projects. “We’re each going to take some time to have fun and experience lots of things,” Jungkook said. “We promise we will return someday, even more mature than we are now.” Members of the band also spoke about feeling burnt out. “I always thought that BTS was different from other groups,” RM said in the video. “But the problem with K-pop and the whole idol system is that they don’t give you time to mature. You have to keep filming [producing music] and keep doing something.” The group noted that the decision wasn’t an easy one to make. “We can’t help but think of our fans no matter what, we want to be the kind of artists that are remembered by our fans. I think now we’re starting to think about what kind of artists we each want to be remembered by our fans,” Jimin said in the video. “I think that’s why we’re going through a hard time right now, we’re trying to find our identity and that’s and that’s an exhausting and long process.” The group, which formed in 2010, first announced a break in 2019. A spokesperson for the band clarified at the time that it was instead a “brief” break, NME reported. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,James Patterson Apologizes For Saying Older White Male Writers Face Racism,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Bestselling author James Patterson apologized Tuesday following backlash to a recent interview in which he argued that older white male writers face “another form of racism” in finding work. “I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work is a form of racism,” the prolific author of thriller novels wrote on Facebook. “I absolutely do not believe that racism is practiced against white writers. Please know that I strongly support a diversity of voices being heard — in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.” Patterson, 75, holds the record for the most books to top The New York Times’ bestsellers list, and is one of the world’s richest and most successful authors. In 2019, Forbes estimated his net worth to be around $800 million. In an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Times published over the weekend, Patterson said that it was becoming difficult for older white male writers to find work in film, theater, television and publishing. ″[It’s] just another form of racism,” Patterson said. “What’s that all about? Can you get a job? Yes. Is it harder? Yes. It’s even harder for older writers. You don’t meet many 52-year-old white males.” His comments were met with fierce backlash. Objectors noted that despite efforts to improve diversity, the publishing world remains overwhelmingly white. “What an obtuse statement from James Patterson,” tweeted Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, author of This Is Why I Resist: Don’t Define My Black Identity. “He best pick up books & educate himself on what racism is. He’s missing good old days when White men had ALL the writing gigs?” In 2020, a New York Times analysis of race in the book industry found that in a sample of more than 7,000 published books, 95 percent were written by white people. Penguin Random House conducted an audit of its published titles between 2019 and 2021 and learned that 75 percent of its contributors were white. “Our contributor demographics do not reflect U.S. reader demographics when it comes to race and ethnicity. Black, Hispanic and Indigenous representation is low while white representation is overindexed,” the publishing house wrote in a report of its findings. It also said it needed to “greatly accelerate” its efforts to improve diversity through a number of initiatives. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Simu Liu Shares 'Painful' Experience Of Waxing His Entire Body For 'Barbie' Movie,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Living in Barbie’s pastel-pink world has been a hair-raising experience for Simu Liu. The “Shang-Chi” star recently revealed that he waxed his entire body for his role in Greta Gerwig’s forthcoming “Barbie” movie, which was filmed in London and is due in theaters next year. “Waxing has been an education to say the least,” Liu told The Independent in an interview published Tuesday. “It was one of the most painful experiences of my life.” “I have such a newfound admiration for the incredibly brave women who go through this on a monthly basis,” he added. Though not much is known about Liu’s “Barbie” character, his cast mates in the much-buzzed-about movie include Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the iconic Mattel doll and her boyfriend, Ken. Speaking to British GQ last month, the actor divulged that he’d been brushing up on his dancing skills for the film, but clarified that it isn’t a musical. He also explained that he’d agreed to join the cast at the suggestion of an agent, who said the screenplay was one of the best he’d ever read. “He literally said this verbatim,” Liu explained. “He was like, ‘If I could stake my career on any one script, it’s the ‘Barbie’ script. I really think you should do it.’” Upon meeting Gerwig in person for the first time, he shared a few of his experiences as a member of a college hip-hop dance team with the director. In hindsight, he’s convinced that helped him land the role. “Greta was talking about how much she loved watching men dance, because it’s such an expression of artistry you’re not used to seeing from typical men,” he said, noting that Gerwig “audibly guffawed” and “giggle-screamed” at some of his memories.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Former NFL Star Tony Siragusa Dies,entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55..

7,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
8,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"

Well, sort of. “There’s some confusion about this movie, partially fueled by you,” Kimmel said, before bringing out images of two of Evans’ tweets from 2020. The Marvel star had retweeted a trailer for “Lightyear” with the comment, “I don’t even have the words.” He actually did have a few more words, though, and followed up with a second tweet that said: “And just to be clear, this isn’t Buzz Lightyear the toy. This is the origin story of the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on.” And just to be clear, this isn’t Buzz Lightyear the toy.

The ceremony took place at the Dolby Theatre after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cynthia Erivo honored Andrews with a musical performance, while actors Hector Elizondo and Anne Hathaway ― who appeared alongside Andrews in “The Princess Diaries” ― also offered tributes. The evening’s most buzzed-about moment, however, was an onstage reunion of Andrews’ “Sound of Music” co-stars. Angela Cartwright, Duane Chase, Nicholas Hammond, Kym Karath and Debbie Turner ― who portrayed five of the seven von Trapp children in the 1965 movie musical ― led the crowd in a singalong of “Do-Re-Mi” from the film. The Hollywood Reporter’s Scott Feinberg captured the heartwarming moment in a video posted to social media.

It received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Wise. Sadly, not every member of the onscreen von Trapp family was in attendance. Christopher Plummer, who played Captain Georg von Trapp, died last year at age 91. Actors Charmian Carr and Heather Menzies, who portrayed Liesl and Louisa von Trapp, died in 2016 and 2017 at ages 73 and 68, respectively.

13,Nipsey Hussle's Last Moments Detailed As Murder Trial Opens,entertainment," LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rapper Nipsey Hussle was gunned down outside his clothing shop in a calculated, premeditated fashion by a man upset over a discussion about snitching, a prosecutor told jurors Monday at the outset of of a long-delayed murder trial. Deputy District Attorney John McKinney said during his opening statement Wednesday that there’s “no doubt” Eric R. Holder knew in advance that he would kill Hussle. The prosecutor described the sequence of events, including the talk about “snitching,” before Hussle’s shooting death three years ago in the South Los Angeles neighborhood where both men grew up and the rapper was helping revitalize. Two others were wounded in the shooting. In addition to shooting Hussle at least 10 times, Holder kicked the rapper in the head before fleeing, McKinney told the jury assembled in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom. “He clearly thought about what he was going to do before he did it,” McKinney told jurors about Holder’s intentions. Holder, 32, faces one count of first degree-murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. Hussle, a hip-hop artist, father of two, and widely beloved South LA local born Ermias Asghedom, was shot and killed at age 33 on March 31, 2019, in the parking lot outside his store, known as The Marathon. McKinney said Holder and Hussle knew each other, growing up in the same neighborhood where they were members of the same gang, the Rollin’ 60s. In his opening statement, McKinney showed jurors videos and photos of the shooting and its aftermath. Images showed the shooting and Holder fleeing the scene, wearing a red shirt and bandana while carrying a semiautomatic gun and a revolver. After a two-day manhunt, Holder was arrested, and two months later he was indicted by a grand jury. McKinney said the shooting stemmed from Hussle hearing that Holder was a snitch and needed to “clear that up.” Before the shooting, he said the rapper and his two friends were having a “cool conversation” with Holder. He said Hussle visited the store without any security. Attorney Aaron Jansen has a formidable task in defending Holder, who could get life in prison if convicted. Multiple eyewitnesses who knew both Holder and Hussle told police and grand jurors that Holder walked up to Hussle and gunned him down. Jansen has said that the killing of Hussle was not premeditated, and the shooting of the other two men was not intended at all, making the first-degree murder and attempted murder charges excessive. He is also likely to make Holder’s mental health an issue. On Wednesday, Jansen said Holder was triggered and didn’t have time to cool off before he gunned down Hussle saying this is a case of “heated passion.” Former gang member Herman “Cowboy” Douglas, who worked at The Marathon, said Hussle didn’t use the actual word “snitch” while overhearing the conversation. He thought Hussle was trying to give Holder some advice in a “chill” exchange. He said Holder asked Hussle if he had listened to his recent music, but he didn’t sense any animosity between both men. “He was saying ’I heard there was some paperwork floating around,” said Douglas, who recalled Hussle’s words to Holder. Douglas was an employee at the clothing store, cleaning the parking lot along with other duties. He viewed himself as a mentor to Hussle, saying he was like his “little brother.” Douglas, 49, who wore a black jacket and T-shirt with Hussle’s image on both, said Hussle added that “I haven’t seen (the paperwork.) You need to take care of that.” Another key witness expected to testify is the woman McKnney said unwittingly served as Holder’s getaway driver, Bryannita Nicholson. Holder and Nicholson had stopped to get food near The Marathon. That led to a chance meeting and brief conversation between Holder and Hussle. McKinney said that “moved Eric Holder to a point of wanting to return to the parking lot and kill Nipsey Hussle.” McKinney said Holder told Nicholson “Drive before I slap you,” following the shooting. Attorneys have spent nearly two weeks choosing a jury, and the trial is expected to last about two more weeks. Hussle, whose nickname is a play on a famous 1970s comedian, was given the moniker for his work ethic as he slung CDs. He spent years winning a devoted following through mixtapes and underground releases, and broke through with a his first major-label album, earning a Grammy nomination just months before he was killed. His death reverberated around the world but it was especially felt in his hometown, where people filled the streets to mark his loss and where he was mourned at a memorial at the 20,000-seat arena then known as Staples Center. In the same building nearly a year later his memory was celebrated in a performance by DJ Khaled, Meek Mill John Legend and others at the Grammy Awards, on the same day another local hero, Kobe Bryant, was killed in a helicopter crash. Hussle left behind his longtime partner, actor Lauren London, with whom he had a son who is now 5 years old. He also had a daughter who is now 13."
14,'Sex And The City' Deftly Portrayed The Complexity Of Choice,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. When we consider what makes a great abortion storyline, we often think it has to include a character actually having an abortion. But today when the basic human right is in jeopardy, one that explores the process of deciding whether or not to even have one is also an act of rebellion. Because that in and of itself reflects a system of choice, the very thing that is at risk right now. Never mind back in 2001, when the word “abortion” was rarely uttered in real life much less on screen, despite over 1 million abortions reported that year in the U.S. alone. But leave it up to “Sex and the City,” which never shied away from taboo topics that make even some people today uncomfortable — like a confidently single woman throwing herself an “I’m not having a baby” shower and lamenting “the funkiest tasting spunk” — to go there. Minutes into a fourth season episode titled “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,” notably pragmatic lawyer Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) tells her best friend Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) in the middle of a bustling New York City sidewalk that she’s pregnant and will have an abortion. Not a whole lot of lead-in here ― only introducing an unwanted reality and Miranda’s solution to it. Even for an audience that had grown used to being dropped into intimate confabs between four independent women, with friends Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), the subject still challenged their comfort with women’s ownership of our bodies unlike any other. But Jenny Bicks, the writer of “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda” and co-executive producer of “Sex and the City,” felt the need to reflect a very prominent reality for women. While she and the rest of her team never wanted the show to be “issue-driven,” their intent was always to challenge the characters. In doing so, they also challenged their audience. “We thought, you really can’t do a show about 30-something women and not talk about abortion and the prevalence,” she told HuffPost. “I think we were aware that we were doing something a little forbidden. But also something that we wanted women to feel was OK.” This notion of self-granted permission comes up a lot throughout the episode, even in terms of talking openly about abortion among friends who bring their own experiences to the proverbial brunch table. Though Bicks said that the writers’ room never had anyone who was anti-abortion on the show, it was important for them to incorporate “differing” voices closest to Miranda who serve as outside influences, even after she makes her decision at the start of the episode. “Every part of your choice is impacted by what’s happening around you,” Bicks added. “Whether it’s your friends going through things, or your parents saying things to you, or what you think society needs from you. So, it’s a lot.” The question of whether or not Miranda should tell her ex-boyfriend Steve (​​David Eigenberg), who impregnated her, about the abortion even carries so much weight. Miranda immediately decides not to, but the very thought of it gives the audience something to consider early in the episode. “That’s something else we wanted, of course,” Bicks said. “What are the parameters of what you owe your partner? How much is your own privacy and how much do you owe to somebody else?” The same questions could be posed to Miranda’s friends, in whom she has always confided. When Miranda tells Samantha and Charlotte her decision at brunch, the latter is incensed because she and her husband have been trying unsuccessfully for five months to have a baby. Charlotte storms off so the three remaining women could have their “abortion talk” without her. Of course that affects Miranda. Maybe not in a way that changes her decision, but it makes her think about how it affects those she loves. That’s a human reality that is just as important to reflect as the decision to have an abortion. Because it shows how nonfrivolous it is. “We are honoring the difficulty of the choice,” Bicks said. And that journey isn’t merely a subplot. It’s the foundation of the entire episode. “I think the mistake when it comes down to this black-and-white fighting about it [is that] it stops being about all of the complications, the gray area for women — still,” Bicks continued. “Once a woman has reached that point where she’s making this decision, it’s not an easy one.” Just as important as it is to portray the complexity of choice, is to show what support for it looks like. Samantha casually says she had two abortions and prompts Carrie to share how many she’s had (one). Their admissions also help destigmatize abortion in solidarity with their friend. Not that Miranda is or should be looking for validation, but it is important that it’s still there for her anyway. “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda” also confronts the so-called “type” of women who get abortions. To this day, abortion storylines are too often attached to the stereotype of someone younger and/or from a lower economic background and/or of color. Samantha, Miranda and Carrie are white, 30-something women who frequently enjoy overpriced cosmopolitans at Manhattan’s finest establishments. Miranda, particularly, could probably provide a baby with an ample amount of financial support. She’s also single, not particularly “young” (though the whole “fertility cliff” myth has been debunked since 2001), far from maternal and didn’t use a condom. That last part, Miranda says, is because she has a lazy ovary and Steve has only one ball following treatment for testicular cancer. And like she asks, “In what twisted world does that create a baby?” While this shows Miranda comically contending with her less-than-typical circumstances that brought her to this point, it’s also her attempt to justify her choice. Carrie does the same thing in her own way. She corrects Samantha, who thinks it was the guy at T.G.I. Fridays who got Carrie pregnant in 1988: “Please, can we not make this worse than it was? He was a waiter at The Saloon, OK?” She even lies and tells her boyfriend Aidan (John Corbett) that she never had an abortion. Later, she confesses her truth but with much hesitation. She was 18 — no, 20. Actually, 22. And the condom broke. Except, they didn’t use a condom. “I should have known better,” she says. It might seem absurd today to think that certain situations are considered more acceptable for abortion than others — like, after hooking up with a guy at a “very happening” hotspot versus one at a popular chain restaurant or a contraception malfunction versus no contraception. But it reflects the shame that women internalize or even make a joke about in a society that continues to judge them for their choice in 2022. Though, it’s important to note that Aidan is only bothered that Carrie lied to him, not that she actually had an abortion. Yes, he is the quintessential TV boyfriend before the Internet Boyfriend was a thing. But he’s also a man, so this could have gone a lot of different (read: bad) ways. Bicks and her team subverted those options. “We didn’t think for a second that Aidan was going to have an issue with her making a choice to have had an abortion,” she said. “It was just, ‘Listen, if we’re in this together, we’re in this together.’ That was really important for us.” But that can be difficult to accept in a society so seeped in female reproach that it can create self-doubt. “It’s all the blame that women put on themselves,” Bicks said. “Could we have handled [it] differently? Maybe,” she continued, voicing the question that lurches to the front of sometimes even the most assured woman’s mind. “But is it always our fault? No. If we did anything on the show, it was to try to bring things that were perceived to be shameful to women at the time, and probably still, [to] light. Because they stop having power if you give words to them.” That’s hard to overcome when even some medical professionals, like Miranda’s own doctor, refuse to perform abortions. He adds, “no judgment!” because even some people who claim to be pro-choice don’t want anything to do with an abortion. Similarly, the episode shows how feminist women like the characters on this show can grapple with their own human contradictions, like Carrie feeling uneasy about how her romantic partner might judge her for having an abortion. “This was a case where we really wanted to just get that out there and say, ‘Look, we all feel these things, but it’s OK,’” Bicks added. Each character’s nuances around abortion were deeply considered and developed over time. “This was not an episode we did in the first season,” Bicks said. “We could not have done this until the audience really understood the characters — and until we really understood the characters, too. Because you really had to understand the motivation.” That includes fleshing out past experiences that brought the characters to who they are in the episode, so that the audience can go on this journey with them. “We probably spent more time talking about when Carrie had an abortion,” Bicks said. “What was that like? Because we were making sure that the audience didn’t turn on her. And to really understand her decision was as important as understanding Miranda’s.” Miranda’s ultimate decision remains unexpected even watching the episode again in 2022. Because she decides to have the baby. But it’s her own personal deliberations that lead her to this point, not anyone else’s. Bicks said that from the beginning she and the team knew she would have the baby, but wanted her to contend with the emotional obstacle of having something complicating her very structured life. “She’s not someone who really believes the universe gives her moments. She’s not woo woo, she’s not that way. But in that moment, that’s the choice she made and she doesn’t regret it. And I think that’s important too.” Equally as significant, Bicks added, is that she showed that Carrie and Samantha have no regrets about their own choice. Though the surprise turn of events challenges Miranda in fascinating ways, it’s hard not to wonder whether she is influenced by the belief that it is her last chance for motherhood. Even Bicks realizes that had the episode been written today, things might have gone a little differently, including having Miranda consider freezing her eggs, which wasn’t popularized back in 2001. “It would be hard for us not to get more moralistic, which is not our show,” she concluded. “We would always put the character first and Miranda would have that child. But boy, it would be tougher because watching someone go through an abortion would also be important.” While no character has an abortion during the episode, the fact that “Sex and the City” devoted an entire half hour to its beloved heroines complexly talking about, reflecting on and considering their experiences with abortion highlights what true women’s liberation can look like. “There are a couple things that when you go back and watch ‘Sex and the City’ seem dated,” Bicks accepted. “And the thing that I would not have thought seemed dated is choice. That this is now something that is up for any kind of debate is terrifying and so wrong.” Senior Culture Reporter"
15,Broadway Dance Captain Nails Tonys Performance With Only 12 Hours' Notice,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The cast of Broadway’s “Six” capped off Sunday night’s Tony Awards with a dazzling mashup of the musical’s title track and a second showstopper, “Ex-Wives.” Written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, “Six” reimagines the six wives of England’s Henry VIII as female pop stars. Actor Abby Mueller stars as Jane Seymour, Henry VIII’s third wife. Catch the “Six” cast’s performance at the 2022 Tony Awards above. Unfortunately, Mueller was unable to join her “Six” castmates at the Tonys after she reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in the day. Producers quickly called in Mallory Maedke, who is the show’s dance captain and Mueller’s alternate, to play Jane Seymour and ensure that the performance would go off without a hitch. The last-minute behind-the-scenes change wasn’t apparent to the audience, so Tonys host Ariana DeBose took a moment before a commercial break to praise Maedke for her hard work. “I do want everybody to hear this because this is what tonight’s been all about,” DeBose told the crowd. “This woman is the dance captain and the alternate who was put into this number 12 hours ago. It’s what they do because the show must go on! And this one will.” mallory maedke getting love after performing at the #TonyAwards with just 12-hour notice, “it’s what they do!” @SixBroadway 👑🤍 pic.twitter.com/crRlQ8k29j DeBose’s shoutout to Maedke felt particularly fitting given the ongoing challenges of staging live theater during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though much of Broadway reopened last fall after an 18-month closure, producers have continued to take unprecedented measures to postpone or curtail performances when principal cast members test positive for COVID-19. Hence, Broadway shows have come to rely more heavily on the tenacity of artists and performers like Maedke to avoid permanent closure ― a point that Patti LuPone also acknowledged as she accepted the Tony for her performance in the musical “Company.” Sunday’s ceremony was, by all accounts, a triumphant one for “Six.” By the end of the night, the musical had won the Tonys for best original score and best costume design in a musical.

0,Seth Meyers Predicts What Fox News Will Say About The Jan. 6 Committee Hearings,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Seth Meyers isn’t surprised that Fox News doesn’t plan to broadcast Thursday evening’s live hearings of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. “The committee will lay out the truth of what happened and Fox will lie. It’s that simple,” Meyers said on “Late Night” Wednesday. “The hearings will say January 6 was a violent insurrection fomented by an outgoing president who nearly pulled off a detailed plan for an attempted coup to unlawfully claim the power that would have installed him as an unelected autocrat and destroyed American democracy,” he added. As for Fox News? Meyers predicted the network “will say it was just a pro-freedom patriot party where everyone peacefully toured the Capitol like they were on a school field trip having to find items their teachers gave them on a worksheet.” The three major broadcast networks ― ABC, CBS and NBC ― will cover the hearings live as will cable channels CNN and MSNBC. Fox News will go ahead with its regular programming, but plans to air the hearings on its website and streaming service. Watch Meyers’ roast below: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Kanye West Accuses Adidas CEO Of Imitating His Yeezy Slides,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) is apparently unhappy with the head honcho of Adidas. The music mogul, who recently took a three-month break from Instagram, returned to the platform on Monday to accuse the company of mimicking his Yeezy slides design. “THIS IS YE driving down the same street Kobe passed on,” he wrote in the since-deleted post, referencing the legendary Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant. Last year, Byant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, outed Nike for allegedly releasing shoes she designed to honor their late child, Gigi, without her consent. “To Kasper I’m not standing for this blatant copying no more,” Ye continued, addressing Adidas’ CEO Kasper Rørsted directly. “To all sneaker culture To every ball player rapper or even if you work at the store. This is for everyone who wants to express themselves but feel they can’t cause they’ll loose their contract or be called crazy Bravery is not being afraid Bravery is overcoming your fear for your truth,” he added. Ye via Instagram: pic.twitter.com/w2qJnQQ8S0 “This Ye with the blue paint on my face These shoes represent the disrespect that people in power have to the talent This shoe is a fake Yeezy made by adidas themselves I’m not talking to DC about this either Kasper come talk to me.” “Happy Monday,” he sarcastically ended the message. Since 2013, the rapper has been a business partner of Adidas, which is expected to release its $55 Adilette 22 sandals on June 23. The Yeezy Slide dropped in 2019, and the Adilette sandals are somewhat similar in style and concept to Ye’s more expensive slides. In 2020, sales for Yeezy sneakers topped nearly $1.7 billion in annual revenue, which landed the rapper a whopping $191 million in royalties, according to Bloomberg. Rørsted has yet to issue a response to Ye’s claims. A post shared by dripped (@dripped.dp) Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Ryan Gosling Gets Ken-ified In First Look At Bleach Blond 'Barbie' Transformation,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Someone once famously told Ryan Gosling, “Seriously? It’s like you’re Photoshopped,” which seems to be the direct inspiration for his role as Ken in the upcoming “Barbie” movie. In the abs-forward first look of the actor in director Greta Gerwig’s live-action take on the iconic Mattel figure, Gosling embodies the plastic hunk in his full glory. Sporting bleached blonder than blond hair, presumably buckets of spray tan lotion and his own personalized “Ken” underwear, the star leans into the fantasy in an image shared Wednesday by Warner Bros. In the photo, Gosling ever so suavely poses against a signature Barbie pink backdrop with his muscles busting out of a denim ensemble, which includes a ripped vest and matching jeans. The photo serves as the perfect complement to the first look at Margot Robbie as the titular doll released in April. If placed side-by-side, the famous couple could even be looking at each other, given the similar color palettes and coordinating outfits. Robbie, who is perched in the seat of a pink Chevrolet Corvette convertible in the photo, however, looks a bit more ’60s inspired, while Gosling could be lifted directly out of a ’90s Marky Mark-style underwear campaign. Apart from Robbie and Gosling, the film will star Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, America Ferrera, Ncuti Gatwa, Simu Liu, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae and Hari Nef. Written by Gerwig and partner Noah Baumbach, “Barbie” is set to hit theaters July 21, 2023. Details on the plot of the film remain scarce, but according to New York Times reporter Kyle Buchanan, the project will feature multiple versions of Barbie and Ken. Last month, Liu teased what fans might expect from the script, which an agent described as “one of the best” he had ever read. “He literally said this verbatim,” the “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” star told GQ. “He was like, ‘If I could stake my career on any one script, it’s the “Barbie” script. I really think you should do it.’” Robbie has also dropped some hints about the film’s approach to the character. Back in 2020, the actor and producer remarked on the responsibility she feels to do right by Barbie’s legacy and subvert audiences’ expectations surrounding her casting. “People immediately have an idea of, ‘Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is.’” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “But our goal is to be like, ‘Whatever you’re thinking, we’re going to give you something totally different — the thing you didn’t know you wanted.’” Gosling, meanwhile, will next be seen in Netflix’s mega-expensive action thriller “The Gray Man” opposite Chris Evans, who surely in some alternate universe would fill out Ken’s cut-off denim vest quite nicely.

3,Jennifer Hudson Lands Historic EGOT Status At The 2022 Tony Awards,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jennifer Hudson joined the ranks of the exclusive group of EGOT winners on Sunday at the Tony Awards. To reach EGOT level, one must win all four of the major American entertainment awards (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and a Tony). The songstress and producer, who has an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar, became the 17th member of the esteemed EGOT titleholders after “A Strange Loop” won Best New Musical. Hudson also made history as the third Black EGOT winner to take the crown, and the fifth woman to receive the distinction. “A Strange Loop,” which was produced by Hudson, was the most Tony-award nominated show of the year, earning a whopping 11 nominations. The musical follows “a young artist grappling with desires, identity and instincts he both loves and loathes,” according to the production’s synopsis. The hit Broadway show boasts more than 40 producers, including Hudson, Don Cheadle, Billy Porter, Alan Cumming, Ilana Glazer, Mindy Kaling and RuPaul Charles. Hudson previously earned a Daytime Emmy for her role as executive producer for “Baby Yaga,” Grammy awards for “The Color Purple” and her debut self-titled studio album, and an Oscar for bestsupporting actress in “Dreamgirls.” Here’s a list of EGOT recipients over the years: Richard Rodgers (1962) Helen Hayes (1977) Rita Moreno (1977) John Gielgud (1991) Audrey Hepburn (1993) Marvin Hamlisch (1995) Jonathan Tunick (1997) Mel Brooks (2001) Mike Nichols (2001) Whoopi Goldberg (2002) Scott Rudin (2012) Robert Lopez (2014) John Legend (2018) Andrew Lloyd Webber (2018) Tim Rice (2018) Alan Menken (2020) Following in the footsteps of another American Idol alum Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson is slated to host her own talk show this fall.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"

(AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,"Teen Abortions On TV Are Still Taboo, But 'Degrassi' Depicted It Nearly 20 Years Ago",entertainment," Culture Reporter This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. During its third season in 2004, “Degrassi: The Next Generation” spotlighted abortion, with 14-year-old burgeoning gymnast Manny Santos (Cassie Steele) as the focal point of the two-part episode titled “Accidents Will Happen.” In Part 1, ahead of a gymnastics meet, Manny is dealing with bouts of nausea and thinks she’s caught a stomach flu. When Manny lends her tampons to teammate Hazel (Andrea Lewis), she says, “Here — I haven’t used mine in forever.” Manny assumes that because she’s been through strenuous training lately, her period is just delayed. But her best friend, Emma (Miriam McDonald), is taken aback and says, “Really?” and ultimately suggests that it could be something else. Annoyed by her nosy friend, Manny walks off. However, the thought of a skipped period being attributed to something else follows her. She later asks Emma’s mother, Spike, who birthed her own daughter as a teen, for a pregnancy test. Her worst nightmare is confirmed: She’s pregnant. Worried about being sent off to a convent in the Philippines, like her cousin, Manny begins weighing her options. The two-part episode ends with her getting an abortion. Since it aired, the episode has been heralded as a progressive catalyst for representation surrounding abortion storylines onscreen. However, then — and now — teen abortions were rarely shown on television. Screenwriter Shelley Scarrow had been a fan of Linda Schuyler’s original teen series from the ’80s, “The Kids of Degrassi Street,” and knew that the series always touched on hot-button topics. Its revived iteration followed a new class of youth at Degrassi Community School and was widely popular in the United States, airing on Nickelodeon’s Teen Nick (previously known as The N and Nick Gas). (In January, it was announced that a new “Degrassi” reboot has been greenlit and is expected to launch in the U.S. exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.) The series touched on ultra-heavy and high-stakes issues: sexuality, sexual assault, penis pumps, disordered eating, school shootings, Islamophobia and other big topics. “If your argument is that you want to teach kids to be safer about sex, then you have to have the episode where someone fucks up and goes through this, to deal with it. Because when kids watch TV, they’re fantasizing themselves in situations,” Scarrow said. “We all do,” she continued. “You have to be able to see yourself as a young woman, as a young woman of color, as a young woman with reproductive freedom. You have to be able to see it. I just think we’re cutting out an enormous and important part of young pregnant people’s lives.” The few abortion narratives on TV do not mirror our society; young people, people of color and other marginalized groups often don’t see their experiences with abortion shown on screen. Instead, audiences often see youth navigating pregnancy, from MTV’s reality television franchise “Teen Mom” to ABC Family’s drama-soap “The Secret Life of the American Teenager.” And it’s rare to see a balanced dialogue between characters about the options available to them upon discovering they’re pregnant. Despite airing other controversial topics, “Accidents Will Happen” was initially banned in the United States and didn’t air until a few years later. Scarrow was a staff writer for the first four seasons of “Degrassi: The Next Generation” and the architect of the two-part episode. She talked to HuffPost about her inspiration for Manny’s storyline, the state of how abortion is addressed on screen today and what it was like having her episode banned in the U.S. HuffPost: “Degrassi: The Next Generation” has never shied away from any topic — ever. Did you know that abortion was something you wanted the series to address? Shelley Scarrow: “The Next Generation” is based on an even older show that was out in the ’80s. One of the hallmarks of that show, one of the things that people remembered, is that they did discuss abortion, and one of the twins on the old show went through an abortion. So when I was a kid, I remembered seeing that, and I remember discussing that with my friends on the playground. It wasn’t even just me. It was just sort of baked into the show; it was something that the show had already talked about, and we knew we wanted to speak about it in a new and different way with different characters. Every year at the beginning of the writing room in “Degrassi,” we would put up the list of issues that we wanted to talk about that year. It was very much the framework of the show that we were like, ‘Here’s hot shit we want to talk about,’ and abortion was always on there. It was just a matter of waiting until it was the right character and the right moment and what felt right for that person. Manny was just the obvious choice. I related the most strongly to her. If anyone ever asks me what character was the easiest, I felt like I could absolutely write Manny in my sleep. She just was this raw, beautiful nerve that I responded to. In pop culture, we don’t tend to see many depictions of young adolescents of color grappling with abortion. Cassie Steele’s portrayal of Manny Santos was groundbreaking in that she was this young Filipina dealing with an unplanned pregnancy, managing her parents’ expectations, navigating fear and other issues. Did you realize at that moment that her narrative would have such a profound impact? I don’t think that I viewed it at that lens, which might be a deficiency of me as a writer in 2003. I just thought a lot about who Manny was. I loved Manny’s background and Manny’s family. We did a lot of research and had conversations with Filipino friends about the culture. But I don’t think we came at it that way at all. One of the great things about writing “Degrassi” was that it’s an anthology show, and I think it’s, like, one of the secrets that nobody realizes is that each episode is about somebody entirely new. There aren’t that many shows that do that, and so whenever you get a chance to write a character, you sort of jump into their life. And I loved jumping into that aspect of her. In the episode, we see Manny meander through the process of figuring out her options. She consults her best friend, Emma, who is staunchly pro-life, and Emma’s mother, Spike, who carried out her teen pregnancy. That episode marks one of the few times I’ve seen a dialogue between characters about abortion as opposed to assuming the fate of the embryo. As a writer, was it important to you to show that thought process and how a 13- or 14-year-old would rationalize their decisions? I think so. It was one of the writing rules of the show that an adult was never allowed to come in and tell a kid what to do. That was one of the things that we felt very strongly about, and that was imparted by Linda [Schuyler] from the original series. An adult wasn’t allowed to fly in and be the fairy godmother and make the choice for the kid; all the choices had to come at the kid level. So speaking to her friends about it and reflecting it through dialogue with her friends was really important. Spike was in a unique situation because she was on the old show, and people had seen her go through it back in the ’80s. She was a little bit of an exception to the rule, but she didn’t express an opinion to Manny or tell her what to do. (A) because that’s not who Spike is as a human being but (B) because that was one of the mandates of the show. I even read a couple of years ago some people had written more up-to-date pieces on abortion choice and some people expressed frustration with Emma doing that, and saying that she was kind of a lousy friend. To me, that was sort of the core of depicting abortion. The reality of it is that people aren’t going to have the same opinions as you, and I think that that’s maybe a little bit of what’s lacking in depictions and in the real world. Part of the truth of that story is the friendship of someone who doesn’t agree with you still supporting you — and that might not be everyone’s version of friendship, but it’s my version of friendship, and I think that it’s also important in the abortion discussion. In consulting her loved ones, Manny goes back to Craig, who she had sex with. Viewers see Manny trying to retrace their steps, asking, “You used a condom, right?” Manny was clearly worried about the prospect of building a future with him. Apart from advancing Craig’s storyline, why was it important to you to depict them going back and forth? I don’t want to say the most political thing possible, but I’m going to say the most political thing possible. I think that ultimately the actual decision rests on the woman and should rest on the woman. I just believe that very fully as a human being. I’m not going to say it was immaterial what Craig’s response was, but I wanted Manny to find her way. That was because, to me, that was the ultimate message of the show: This is your decision. This is your choice. You make it and you decide who you talk to about it. You decide. The two-part episode ends with Manny and her mother at the clinic and a nurse walking Manny into a room for her procedure. We don’t see her take a pill, lie on a gurney or any chilling, cold, preoperative protocol. Rather, she’s taken under the nurse’s wing ― and the screen fades to black. Why is that? I actually had a friend who worked in an abortion clinic at the time, and I talked to her a lot. I did a lot of research on that episode with her. I talked to some of her friends who were nurses. That kind of moment in your life is huge, and skipping it in any way was just not on the table. It was really important for me to see that she’s OK. There’s so much rhetoric around abortion — so much angry rhetoric — but in my experience with friends who’ve gone through abortions, it’s a decision that you make just like if you went to the dentist. Now, it’s not the same as going to the dentist, but what I’m trying to say is the reality of going through the clinic and the procedure. It’s not hellfire and horror; it’s a medical procedure. It’s something you go to a doctor’s office for, and you do, and showing that was important. What was your reaction upon realizing that Part 2 of the episode had been banned in the U.S.? (The N, the U.S. distributor of “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” refused to air the second part of the episode for years.) I was like, ‘I am hardcore! I’m banned in America!’ Like, if nothing else, put this on my gravestone. It was the only episode that was banned — and we did crazy shit! James [Hurst] wrote a penis pump episode that they showed, and they talked about a penis pump. And I was like, ‘We can talk about that, but we can’t deal with this very real issue that your viewers are going through?’ I will say Nickelodeon was very supportive the entire way through the process, and they tried really hard internally — and I will never take that away from them. I went on a journey with Manny in writing those episodes. I was a 30-year-old woman when I wrote those episodes, and I think that I had always been pro-choice. There is something about the act of sitting down and going through it very directly from a character’s point of view — and having to think through Emma’s point of view, which was 100% not the same as mine — that made me question abortion in a rigorous manner. I still came back around to my same decision, but I was like, ‘This is what art does. This is what art is supposed to do.’ That’s the reality for a lot of young women, and I applaud it. But I just think it’s important to show all the choices and to be rigorous about them so that it’s informed on all levels and all sides because otherwise you just end up in this binary. ​​We’re still in this era where television storylines that address abortion are perceived as taboo. Even the ways in which it is depicted are very narrow, often centering a cis-het white female lead. What does it mean to you now that this is still a topic of contention on screen? Why is it important to continue to show these thorough storylines, with all options front and center? I’m aware that I am a white woman saying this, but I think representation matters. And I think that representation on everything matters. And so I think that if we’re cutting out representation of what the thousands of women and pregnant people are actually doing, and the choice that they’re making, then we’re not letting them see themselves on TV. And we’re also not preparing people mentally. If your argument is that you want to teach kids to be safer about sex, then you have to have the episode where someone fucks up and goes through this, to deal with it. Because when kids watch TV, they’re fantasizing themselves in situations. We all do. You have to be able to see yourself as a young woman, as a young woman of color, as a young woman with reproductive freedom. You have to be able to see it. I just think we’re cutting out an enormous and important part of young pregnant people’s lives. What is your hope for the evolution of how screenwriters portray youth navigating abortion on television and in movies? What would you like to see from the next generation of writers? To me, it’s truth and honesty and rigor, and I think that’s the job of storyteller, and I think that’s the job of story. I would love to see more representation, period, including women making the choice to keep a child, including women making the choice to put them up for adoption. I feel like the balance has never been equal. We have never, ever seen enough representations of this choice that a lot of young people make — including trans people, pregnant people of all stripes. That’s what I would like to see: rigor, honesty, and a little bit more balance. Culture Reporter"
11,Brian Cox Is Always Asked To Say These 2 Words On Cameo,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost “Succession” star Brian Cox has turned the words “F**k off” into a personal trademark ― and a lucrative side hustle. The actor is on Cameo, where he charges $689 to send personal ― and profane ― greetings to fans. And, yes, it seems like every person requesting a video has two specific words they want him to say, based on this supercut. Possible 6th love language for Dads #fyp #fathersday But while Cox is happy to drop F-bombs on the HBO series and on Cameo, he only does it for fans on a case-by-case basis, he told The Hollywood Reporter last week. During a panel with fellow actors Oscar Isaac, Tom Hiddleston, Quincy Isaiah, Michael Keaton and fellow expletive legend Samuel L. Jackson, Cox admitted the public desire to hear him curse can be awkward. “Well, it’s not the easiest thing to say to people,” Cox confessed. “I mean, it started when I was playing L.B.J. in one of those theaters in New York. I came out one night and there was this young couple, very sweet, about 17, and they had a video and they said, ‘Could you tell us to fuck off, please?’ I mean, it’s unbelievable.” Cox then described an awkward request he received at an event for Ronan Farrow’s book launch. “All these Hollywood women were there and it was very intense,” he said. “And I was standing at the back and then [the women] all turned around and saw me and they [pointed a] camera and said, ‘Can you tell us to fuck off?’” “I was like, ‘This is a #MeToo meeting, is this really proper to be asking me to tell you to fuck off? And does that mean that I get canceled?’” Jackson said people ask him to say his trademark word “motherfucker” all the time, or to record a message on their answering machine like, “This motherfucker’s not home right now. And the motherfucker will call you back.” But Jackson demurred after Cox pointed out he could charge money to say the phrase. “I don’t want to gouge the public. I charge them enough to come to my movies,” Jackson said. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Jonathan Groff And Lea Michele Lead Epic 'Spring Awakening' Reunion At Tony Awards,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Lea Michele helped turn the clock back ― musically, at least ― nearly 16 years when she took the stage at the 2022 Tony Awards Sunday night. The actor and her longtime pal Jonathan Groff reunited with the cast of Broadway’s “Spring Awakening” for a haunting performance of the song “Touch Me.” When it debuted on Broadway in 2006, “Spring Awakening” broke ground as an exploration of teen sexuality, mental health and sexual assault. The show received eight Tony Awards. Though Groff and Michele were the musical’s breakout stars, the show also launched the careers of actors John Gallagher Jr. (who won a Tony for his role), Skylar Astin and Gideon Glick. All were present at Sunday’s ceremony. Catch the “Spring Awakening” Tonys performance below: The cast’s performance at the Tony Awards was the culmination of a nearly yearlong 15th anniversary celebration. Last year, the cast came together for a one-night-only reunion concert, staged at New York’s Imperial Theater under strict COVID-19 protocols. The production was chronicled in the HBO documentary “Spring Awakening: Those You’ve Known,” released last month. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight ahead of her Tonys appearance, Michele said the experience of reuniting with the “Spring Awakening” cast was “just wild,” particularly given the lingering challenges of the pandemic. “We managed to get the entire original cast together,” she said. “We managed to get through the hurdles of COVID and everything and reunite and come together. And we’re just so honored to be back.” Asked about what he’d tell the younger version of himself and his co-stars about the success of “Spring Awakening,” Groff said, “I would tell them to take it in.” “You know what, we did take it in back then, we really did,” he added. “So many of the adults in the theater community and Michael Mayer, our director, they were keeping us very grounded and in the moment. If I were to experience it all again, I would just take it in all over again.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Zendaya Claps Back Over Pregnancy Rumors: ‘This Is Why I Stay Off Twitter’,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Zendaya is totally over the internet’s recent pregnancy rumors. On Wednesday, the “Dune” star seemingly addressed the swirling buzz that she’s pregnant with a post on her Instagram story that read: “See now, this is why I stay off Twitter.“ Although she didn’t specifically address the rumors, her hint seems quite direct. “Just making stuff up for no reason…weekly,” she added. The debacle ignited after a viral TikTok video surfaced, showcasing a fake ultrasound from the Emmy-award winning actor. The video contains a photoshopped screenshot of Zendaya’s Instagram, which sent fans into a frenzy, leading them to believe that she posted the big news from her account. This hit TikToK as a ki and now y’all in an uproar talking about Zendaya is pregnant 😭 Y’all have to stop. pic.twitter.com/U7qJp4ZZzk Brushing off the gossip, Zendaya wrote in a follow-up post, “Anyway back to filming,” while plugging her upcoming film “Challengers.” The film, set to release on August 11, 2023, will also star Mike Faist (“West Side Story”) and Josh O’Connor (“The Crown”). Even Lil Nas X had words for the sizzling hearsay. The entertainer joked on Twitter that he was “about to congratulate zendaya via dm about a baby that doesn’t exist.” He then pointed the finger at the social platform for the mix-up. i hate twitter because i’m sitting here about to congratulate zendaya via dm about a baby that doesn’t exist Although the hoax proved to be a false alarm, Zendaya and her boyfriend, actor Tom Holland are still going strong. The adorable duo, who have been dating publicly since last July after they were spotted kissing at an airport, shared a special moment on Instagram this month. On June 1, Zendaya posted a loving message for the “Spider-Man: No Way Home” star’s 26th birthday. “Happiest of birthdays to the one who makes me the happiest,” she wrote.

14,Trevor Noah Wants To Know: What's The Difference Between Drunk Rudy And Sober Rudy?,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Trevor Noah mocked Rudy Giuliani on “The Daily Show” Monday for having the “liquid courage” to instruct former President Donald Trump to simply claim he won the presidency on election night — long before all the votes were even counted. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection made a point of mentioning at its hearing Monday that Giuliani was “apparently inebriated,” “intoxicated” and “had too much to drink” that night. “I’m just curious about how you even know when Rudy Giuliani is drunk?” Noah asked. “No, because when a normal person is drunk, they say crazy things, they yell, they sweat a lot. So how does that work for Rudy? Does it work in reverse? Like does he start talking normally? His hair dye sucks back in his hair?” Noah was also shocked to learn that Trump coordinated the insurrection, as the Jan. 6 panel is arguing, because he didn’t think Trump could “coordinate anything in advance.” “The man can’t even plan where a sentence should end,” Noah said.

0,Tom Cruise And James Corden Star In 'Bottom Gun' With Tea And Biscuits,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Tom Cruise and James Corden reunited for another goofy air adventure ― and brought along some other “Top Gun: Maverick” cast members. (Watch the video below.) On Thursday’s “Late Late Show,” Cruise’s Maverick and Corden’s Honey Butter are on a mission. But other matters get in the way. It seems the other pilots, played by “Maverick” stars Monica Barbaro, Jay Ellis and Glenn Powell, hate Corden’s soft call sign and aren’t down for tea and biscuits while the enemy fires at them. But Honey Butter won’t be deterred in the new sequel, “Bottom Gun.” Last month, Corden and Cruise teamed up for a segment in which the cinema hero took the host for a ride in vintage and modern aircraft. But after the lower-budget animated outing, Cruise still tells Corden, “You can be my wingman anytime, Honey Butter.” “Top Gun: Maverick” is believed to have a shot at earning $1 billion at the box office worldwide.

1,Amber Heard Fears Future Defamation Lawsuits From Depp For Speaking Out,entertainment," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Amber Heard said she fears that she could face future defamation lawsuits by speaking out about her volatile relationship with Johnny Depp in a sit-down interview where she also addressed her past pledge to donate $7 million to charity. In part three of an interview aired Wednesday with NBC News, the “Aquaman” actor said she is “scared” that she risks being forever silenced after a judge earlier this month ordered her to pay $10 million in damages over a 2018 op-ed she published about domestic abuse. The essay did not mention Depp by name but his attorneys successfully argued to the jury that it indirectly referred to their marriage. Watch all of part two of @SavannahGuthrie's exclusive interview with Amber Heard, in which Heard discusses her future, fears about new defamation lawsuits and whether she still “has love” for Johnny Depp: pic.twitter.com/xr3EX9se6K “I’m scared that no matter what I do, no matter what I say, or how I say it — every step that I take will present another opportunity for this sort of — silencing, which is what, I guess, a defamation lawsuit is meant to do,” she told NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. Heard maintained that she did the right thing and “everything I could to stand up for myself and the truth” after publishing the op-ed in The Washington Post, though she continued to insist that it was never about her marriage with Depp. “What the op-ed was about was ... me loaning my voice to a bigger cultural conversation that we were having at the time,” she said, with the essay being published at the height of the #MeToo movement. Heard said she had a team of lawyers review the essay before it was published and that it was never her intention to “defame” Depp or get him “canceled” over it, saying she still has love for the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star. Guthrie went on to question her credibility and how the jury heard that she hasn’t fulfilled a 2016 promise to donate $3.5 million of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union. Heard faced intense questioning during her trial over her past claim that the money has been donated. An ACLU executive testified that she has given less than half of that money, with her last payment made in 2018. EXCLUSIVE: @SavannahGuthrie asks Amber Heard about her pledge to donate $7 million of her divorce settlement and if her statements about the money ""raised questions of [Heard's] credibility with the jury."" pic.twitter.com/3V2aBGxyAI “I made a pledge and that pledge is made over time by its nature,” Heard told Guthrie of the funds. “You said ‘I donated.’ You know that everyone thinks that you donated it, not that you pledged it. So to the jurors sitting there, do you think that they felt like that was you getting caught in a lie?” Guthrie asked. “I don’t know, because I feel like so much of the trial was meant to cast aspersions on who I am as a human, to call me a liar in every way you can,” Heard responded. “That was the trial. It was a credibility contest. That was it,” Guthrie said. Heard said she still plans to honor that donation and pay it in full, NBC reported. An hourlong special of Heard’s interview will air Friday on “Dateline NBC” at 8 p.m./7 p.m. CT. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
2,A Real-Life 'Squid Game' Is In The Works Because We're In A Real-Life Dystopia,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Here’s just hoping Netflix execs won’t be featured on the show wearing elaborate animal masks. The streamer announced Tuesday that a reality competition series called “Squid Game: The Challenge” based on its Korean smash-hit series “Squid Game” is in the works. Do you want to play a game? Enter to join Squid Game: The Challenge at https://t.co/MaXfZnqmvb pic.twitter.com/6gYLXlplDC Like the original scripted series, the reality show will feature “456 real players” who “will enter the game in pursuit of a life-changing reward of $4.56 million,” according to a press release. “As they compete through a series of games inspired by the original show — plus surprising new additions — their strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated around them,” it reads. And what will these “surprising new additions” be? Hopscotch? Heads Up, Seven Up? Dodgeball With Explosives? Well, maybe not the latter — because Netflix also noted that “in this game the worst fate is going home empty-handed.” So it doesn’t seem like any of the actual contestants will die. Recruitment for the series is currently open to English language speakers from anywhere in the world. Although the reality show got the red light, green light, “Squid Game” fans have said that making the fictionalized games into a reality show misses the point of the original series’ first season. (A second season of the scripted series was also announced earlier this week.) Season 1 of “Squid Game” is a cautionary tale about wealth disparity. In the show, financially desperate people kill one another in a series of kids’ games to win a life-changing cash prize for a few wealthy VIPs’ entertainment. “Squid Game” creator Hwang Dong-hyuk even likened one of the VIPs in the show to former President Donald Trump. But if you’re just a pleb who wants to see actual people murder this concept on Twitter, scroll down.

3,Lizzo Changes Lyric In New Song After Criticism Over Ableist Slur,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Lizzo has changed a lyric in her new song, “Grrrls,” after listeners pointed out it was an ableist slur. “It’s been brought to my attention that there is a harmful word in my new song,” the Grammy-winning singer wrote Monday on Instagram. “Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language. As a fat black woman in America, I’ve had many hurtful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally).” She said there was a new version of the song with a lyric change. “This is the result of me listening and taking action. As an influential artist I’m dedicated to being part of the change I’ve been waiting to see in the world,” she wrote. A post shared by Lizzo (@lizzobeeating) In the opening verse of the new single, Lizzo sings: “Do you see this shit? I’ma spaz.” As a number of disability advocates noted after the song’s Friday release, the slang term, sometimes used colloquially to mean crazy, clumsy or incompetent, is a derogatory word that stems from terminology used to describe conditions of certain movement disorders and cerebral palsy. Hey @lizzo my disability Cerebral Palsy is literally classified as Spastic Diplegia (where spasticity refers to unending painful tightness in my legs) your new song makes me pretty angry + sad. ‘Spaz’ doesn’t mean freaked out or crazy. It’s an ableist slur. It’s 2022. Do better. Oh @lizzoA VERY influential figure, using the word sp@z in her new song. An offensive and derogatory term. As someone who’s written about the use of disability language, especially slang/slur words which have been used in schools, this is a huge step back.Please, remove it. On Monday, the version of the song on Spotify contained a different lyric: “Do you see this shit? Hold me back.” Some of those who initially spoke out applauded Lizzo for the way she handled the situation: I’m going to cry 😭 Thank you so much for hearing us Lizzo and for understanding that this was only ever meant gently and being open to learning, it honestly means the world ❤️. You’re a real true ally https://t.co/RbQCbAwpR6 And that’s how it’s done ✅ https://t.co/il6UYqkl1I The lyric has also been changed in the song on Lizzo’s official YouTube channel. Her fourth studio album, “Special,” is due to be released July 15. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks.

7,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
8,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Shonda Rhimes Put Abortion On Screen When Few Shows Did. Here’s What It Took To Get It On TV.,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost This article is part of a larger series titled “The End Of Roe.” Head here to read more. By the early 2010s, Shonda Rhimes had created and was running three hit shows on ABC: “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Private Practice” and “Scandal.” In a time when there were just a handful of TV shows that had featured abortion storylines (and often on “very special episodes”), all three of her shows depicted abortion matter-of-factly, demonstrating how it’s a part of many people’s everyday lives and shouldn’t be so highly stigmatized. On “Private Practice,” OB-GYN and neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) was both an abortion provider and someone who herself had previously gotten an abortion. And twice on Rhimes’ shows, audiences saw lead characters (and in even more of a rarity, both of them women of color) getting an abortion on prime-time television. In the years since, there has been a marked increase in TV shows that have featured abortion storylines. Yet, even now, these episodes are striking in their clarity and frankness. On “Grey’s” in 2011, surgeon Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) has an abortion, an obvious choice for her as a character. A few years later, in a 2015 episode of “Scandal,” political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) gets an abortion that goes virtually unmentioned before or after, like a footnote in the show. Moreover, when being a woman who doesn’t want children still feels like a third-rail issue, both storylines are also significant in their depictions of women who unquestionably do not want children — and therefore, are forthright and unwavering in their decision to have an abortion. As Rhimes recalled in an email to HuffPost, there was never a question her shows would portray abortion. “I feel strongly that abortion should be portrayed on TV — especially on medical shows like ‘Grey’s’ and ‘Private Practice’ — even though it is in direct conflict with my own personal experience,” said Rhimes, who, in 2017, was named a member of Planned Parenthood’s national board. “Personally, I would never make the choice to have an abortion, but I would fight for any other woman’s ability to make that choice for herself. That is what choice means. My shows portray the entire spectrum of health. Health includes showing women having agency over their own bodies. And I feel strongly about women’s health and I truly believe in choice. More people should.” Rhimes’ complex road to getting these stories onscreen reflects how thorny and stigmatized abortion was — and still is — to talk about on TV. It also reflects how the political and cultural pendulum has swung back and forth, with the mounting abortion restrictions in numerous U.S. states over the past few years, which have led up to the impending Supreme Court decision that will likely overturn Roe v. Wade. Abortion first came up on “Grey’s” as early as 2005, in the show’s first season, when Cristina discovers she is pregnant. “At that point, abortion seemed like a reasonable choice for a woman of her age, needs and life experience,” Rhimes said. At the start of Season 2, Cristina schedules an abortion — and coins the now-iconic phrase “you’re my person” when she lists Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) as her emergency contact. A few episodes later, Cristina collapses during a surgery and finds out she is having a miscarriage due to an ectopic pregnancy. ABC executives had anticipated backlash to Cristina getting an abortion, so as a new showrunner on her very first show, Rhimes thought it was best to change the storyline. “To be clear, the network did not object,” she said. “They did not tell me that Cristina could not have an abortion. They shared data and told me what they feared the audience reaction would be. And I was a new showrunner. Hell, I was new to TV itself. That episode was, like, the 11th episode of any TV I had ever done in my entire life. I felt insecure about making that controversial choice for my character when I was so new to the game. The network did not change that storyline. I did. I wasn’t ready.” But six years later, Rhimes had cemented her reputation and track record as a showrunner and was more than ready to put an abortion storyline on “Grey’s.” When Cristina finds out she’s pregnant toward the end of Season 7, there’s no question she plans to have an abortion. In the final minutes of the Season 8 premiere, Cristina, accompanied by her then-husband Owen (Kevin McKidd), is seen at the start of the procedure. “I want to ask you one more time: Are you absolutely sure this is what you want to do?” the doctor performing the abortion asks. She nods and turns to Owen, who holds her hand as the procedure begins. “By Season 8, I was sure of myself as a showrunner. I was sure of my place in the TV landscape. I’d told complex stories about women’s health through Addison on both ‘Grey’s’ and ‘Private Practice.’ And I also had spent eight seasons learning more about my character and becoming more sure of who she was and what she wanted,” Rhimes said. “Both Cristina and I had grown. I was sure that abortion was the right choice for Cristina and for the show at that point. After all, we were a medical show and this is a medical procedure.” Cristina’s storyline is also uncommonly frank in the way it normalizes women who are sure they don’t want children. In the Season 7 finale “Unaccompanied Minor,” Owen, who knows Cristina does not want children, nevertheless tries to talk her out of the abortion. He thinks she could change her mind on having children, an argument women who don’t want children are often told. He then portrays it as a compromise for the sake of their marriage. Cristina rightly points out having a kid when you don’t want one isn’t a compromise like choosing between pizza and Thai for dinner. (The show further explores these themes later in Season 8, when Owen ignites an explosive fight about the abortion and their marriage.) In the Season 8 premiere, Meredith, whose domineering and verbally abusive mother resented Meredith for impeding her career, sets Owen straight. “Do you know what will happen to Cristina? If she has a kid that she doesn’t want? It will almost kill her. Trying to pretend that she loves a kid as much as she loves surgery will almost kill her, and it’ll almost kill your kid,” she tells Owen. “Do you know what it’s like to be raised by someone who didn’t want you? I do. To know you stood in the way of your mother’s career? I do. I was raised by a Cristina. My mother was a Cristina. And as the child she didn’t want, I am telling you: Don’t do this to her. Because she’s kind and she cares, and she won’t make it. The guilt of resenting her own kid will eat her alive.” In 2015, “Scandal” was once again frank about a woman having an abortion. In some ways, the show went even further than “Grey’s” did: Olivia Pope’s abortion was remarkable for being utterly unremarkable. In the holiday episode of Season 5, “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” senator and former first lady Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young) leads a filibuster against a government spending package that would strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood. About two-thirds of the way through the episode, Olivia is watching news coverage of the filibuster, when the camera pans around to reveal she’s in a medical waiting room. “Ms. Pope, are you ready to begin?” a health care worker asks. During a montage of “Silent Night,” an overhead light turns on, and Olivia grips the operating table and looks up at the ceiling, as the procedure begins. The abortion isn’t mentioned again until an offhand reference in the Season 5 finale, when Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) tells Olivia: “I support your choice … not that you needed it.” The abortion is like a blip in the course of Olivia’s day. It does not require an explanation or need to be a matter of discussion, reinforcing the message that this is her choice and hers alone. As Young and Rhimes recounted to The Hollywood Reporter in 2017, ABC’s Standards and Practices had strong objections to the extremely brief scene of the procedure and wanted to cut it. “I said: ‘Go ahead, alter the scene. We’ll just have a lot of articles about how you altered the scene,’” Rhimes said at the time. Rhimes recalls now that she had girded herself for a protracted battle with network executives, taking steps to preempt their objections. She anticipated there would be pushback to showing the abortion itself, as well as the fact that “Olivia choosing not to have Fitz’s child was a powerful statement about womanhood and the rejection of a dangerous fairytale of happily ever after that a lot of people did not know how to handle.” “There were lots of phone calls from the network asking me not to do it,” she said. “I really wanted to show the procedure because I wanted to remove the stigma and fear associated with it. I knew that would be a battle. So we carefully prepared ahead of time. Earlier on the series, we told the story of a woman in the military who had been raped and we showed Olivia holding the military person’s hand as she had an abortion. We got very few notes on that scene and it aired. When it came time to shoot Olivia’s abortion, we shot it and edited it so that it was basically almost shot for shot the exact same scene. That meant that even though the network objected to the scene, they were unable to change it. Because they had basically already aired that very same scene.” Rhimes remembers that “every aspect of that episode was a battle with the network — from Mellie’s Planned Parenthood funding filibuster to the use of Aretha Franklin’s “Silent Night” as the source music for Olivia’s abortion,” she said. “I have never fought so hard for a ‘Scandal’ episode.” At the time Cristina’s and Olivia’s storylines aired, each was lauded as a huge deal, a groundbreaking moment on TV. Since then, the landscape of abortion depictions in pop culture has changed considerably. In 2016, there were just 13 abortion-related plotlines on major scripted shows in the U.S., according to the Abortion Onscreen database, compiled by researchers at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. By 2021, there were at least 47 abortion-related plotlines on 42 shows. These can include a character getting an abortion, contemplating one, disclosing a past abortion, or providing support to someone deciding to get an abortion. However, the group’s research has found that TV still falls short in capturing the full range of abortion stories, whether it’s in the kinds of protagonists (usually white and wealthy), barriers to abortion access, or safe alternatives to the surgical procedure, such as medication abortion, which will become increasingly vital in a post-Roe world. No matter the circumstance, showing a major TV character getting an abortion still feels like a significant cultural moment. Rhimes believes these episodes on her shows would certainly still be a big deal had they been made now, particularly as abortion remains so highly stigmatized and politicized, and the country heads toward a post-Roe landscape. “If you had asked me six years ago, I would have had a different answer. But we are moving backwards so fast on women’s rights that I obviously think any episodes on abortion would be a big deal now,” she said. “And let’s be clear: Nothing will normalize abortion on TV as long as a woman’s right to choose is not normalized in real life. We all need to stop waiting for TV characters to do the powerful change-making work that we should be requiring of our real-life elected officials.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

While getting her hair dolled up by stylist Chris McMillan on Sunday, Aniston showcased more than just her new cut on her Instagram story. She also happened to be sporting the dress she stole from Courteney Cox on the set of the hit show “Friends” over 20 years ago. The actor shared screenshots of Cox in the now-infamous black floral lace dress that Cox’s character Monica originally wore in the 22nd episode of Season 8. “Does the dress look familiar?” Aniston jokingly wrote alongside a side-eye emoji. “Still got it!” McMillan also shared his own image of the dress as he posed with Aniston showing off her new haircut. A post shared by C H R I S M C M I L L A N (@mrchrismcmillan) “Friends” aired on NBC from 1994 to 2004. Last May, the cast gathered for a reunion that premiered on HBO Max. Leading up to the reunion, the cast members told People magazine that they kept mementos from the original set. Aniston admitted to ripping off the aforementioned ageless dress from Cox. “I went into her line of clothes and I pulled it out, and I still have it and wear [it] to this day,” she shared. “It has tiny little flowers with a black lace V-neck and a little cap sleeve with a little slight ruffle of black lace,” the actor explained at the time. “I still have it to this day, I still wear it and it fits,” she added.

13,The Rockford Peaches Are Back In 'A League Of Their Own' Series Reboot,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Diamonds are a girl’s best friend once again in the forthcoming reboot of “A League of Their Own.” Amazon gave viewers a first look on Tuesday at the new Rockford Peaches with a teaser for the eight-episode series, which debuts Aug. 12 and is based on the beloved 1992 film of the same name. Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City,” who co-created the show with Will Graham, leads the cast as Carson Shaw, while Chanté Adams, D’Arcy Carden, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Roberta Colindrez are among her teammates. Actor Nick Offerman also stars as the team’s manager, Casey “Dove” Porter. Like the movie, the new “League of Their Own” is set in 1943, the same year that the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was created. The women’s league was formed as Major League Baseball was thrown into crisis mode during World War II, when many male athletes were drafted. Catch the trailer for “A League of Their Own” below. According to press notes, the series differs from its film predecessor by taking “a deeper look at race and sexuality, following the journey of a whole new ensemble of characters as they carve their own paths towards the field, both in the league and outside of it.” By all accounts, there are some pretty big cleats to fill. Directed by Penny Marshall, the original “League of Their Own” starred Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna and is widely regarded as a classic. Rosie O’Donnell, who played one of the Rockford Peaches in the film, reportedly will make an appearance on the new series. Appearing on “The Drew Barrymore Show” last year, Jacobson said that the series evokes “the spirit and the joy” of the movie while exploring more of “the realities of what was really going on in 1943.” “A door opens for a lot of white women and white-passing women that get on the league that we all know from the film,” she explained. “But what about the Black women who were not allowed to try out and who had to sort of carve their own path to play baseball? It’s also a really queer story.” Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
14,"Samuel L. Jackson Says Finally Getting Oscar 'Wasn't A Big Deal,' Blasts Recent Ceremony",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Samuel L. Jackson finally received his first Academy Award last year ― not that he’s been checking on one over his legendary career. Days before presenting Will Smith with his post-slap statuette, the actor was awarded an honorary Oscar at the Governor’s Awards, which he said ultimately “wasn’t a big deal for me” in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times. “I was past it. I was never going to let the Oscars be a measure of my success or failure as an actor,” Jackson told the outlet. “My yardstick of success is my happiness: Am I satisfied with what I’m doing? I’m not doing statue-chasing movies. You know [whispers]: ‘If you do this movie, you’ll win an Oscar.’” “No, thanks. I’d rather be Nick Fury. Or having fun being Mace Windu with a lightsaber in my hand,” he added. Jackson was previously honored with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” but the award ultimately went to Martin Landau for “Ed Wood.” He’s never been nominated for another performance since. The Marvel star said he believes he should have been recognized for at least two other Tarantino projects ― “Jackie Brown” and “Django Unchained” ― describing the latter film as his “best shot” for winning a trophy. “It’s the most evil character I’ve ever played and they generally reward Black people for playing horrendous s—,” he said. But Oscar-bait roles haven’t been what’s driven Jackson’s career so far. He’d much rather be known for starring in projects that “made me want to go to the movies when I was a kid.” “I’m satisfied because that’s who I am. I’m the guy who does the lines that people see on T-shirts,” he said. “There’s actors who go their whole careers and no one can quote a line they’ve said in a movie.” “People go to watch my movies to see how crazy I’m going to be or see how many times I say motherf—,” he added. “Whatever gets them in the seats.” His less-than-favorable opinion of the ceremony was only further soured by this year’s show, which left him a “little ticked” over a truncated tribute to the late Hollywood icon Sidney Poitier. “The greatest actor we had in Hollywood died and they gave him, what, 10 f— seconds,” Jackson said. “The reason Will Smith won an Oscar is because of this guy. The reason for Denzel [Washington], the reason for me, the reason for Danny [Glover], the reason for everybody is that guy, and he deserves more than 10 f— seconds of your time.” Jackson went on to blast the decision to instead give screen time to various athletes who introduced a tribute to James Bond onstage at the ceremony. “They have their show. They have the ESPYs. Go do that,” he said. “This is the night Hollywood celebrates f— Hollywood. That thing that we used to have when I was young, watching it and wondering, ‘What am I going to say when I get mine’ was the glamor of it all, the extravagance, the mystique that is Hollywood. Some of that’s gone.” Jackson recently appeared in the Apple TV+ limited series “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” and will soon make his return to the Marvel universe in two upcoming projects. First, he’ll star in the Disney+ series “Secret Invasion” alongside Ben Mendelsohn, Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke, before reuniting with Brie Larson in the upcoming Captain Marvel sequel “The Marvels,” which hits theaters in July 2023.

15,New Doc Examines 'Carol' Author Patricia Highsmith's Complex Love Life,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Author Patricia Highsmith achieved global fame with 1950’s “Strangers on a Train” and 1955’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” but a new documentary reveals her private life to have been even more multifaceted than her novels. Filmmaker Eva Vitija pored over many of Highsmith’s personal notes and diaries for “Loving Highsmith.” The film, which will be screened at the 2022 Provincetown International Film Festival in Provincetown, Massachusetts, this week ahead of a planned wider release, is a compelling look at Highsmith’s romantic relationships with women during her lifetime. A Texas native, Highsmith spent much of her adult life in Europe, settling in Switzerland. She died in 1995 at age 74, just four years before “The Talented Mr. Ripley” was adapted into a smash movie starring Matt Damon and Jude Law. The author drew heavily from her own life while writing 1952’s lesbian romance “The Price of Salt,” which was published under a pseudonym, Claire Morgan. In 1990, the book was republished as “Carol,” this time under Highsmith’s name. The book was the basis for the 2015 film starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Catch the “Loving Highsmith” trailer below. “Loving Highsmith” features interviews with several of Highsmith’s surviving girlfriends, and paints the author as a somewhat divisive figure in the queer literary canon. She is believed to have viewed homosexuality as a psychological defect and often mixed homoeroticism with homicide, most notably in “The Talented Mr. Ripley.” “Patrica Highsmith was a child of her time. And she wasn’t fighting for gay rights,” Vitija told Variety in April. “For her, love is such a brutal experience that extinguished her as a person that it is an experience of death, so murder is never far. In the love-scenes of ‘Carol’ and how she describes them, death is always around the corner.” Still, Vitija emphasizes that Highsmith’s “wildly romantic and poetic side” is the focal point of her film. “It was a Patricia Highsmith completely different from the one I was reading about in biographies or mainly articles in newspapers,” she said.

0,"Samuel L. Jackson Says Finally Getting Oscar 'Wasn't A Big Deal,' Blasts Recent Ceremony",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Samuel L. Jackson finally received his first Academy Award last year ― not that he’s been checking on one over his legendary career. Days before presenting Will Smith with his post-slap statuette, the actor was awarded an honorary Oscar at the Governor’s Awards, which he said ultimately “wasn’t a big deal for me” in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times. “I was past it. I was never going to let the Oscars be a measure of my success or failure as an actor,” Jackson told the outlet. “My yardstick of success is my happiness: Am I satisfied with what I’m doing? I’m not doing statue-chasing movies. You know [whispers]: ‘If you do this movie, you’ll win an Oscar.’” “No, thanks. I’d rather be Nick Fury. Or having fun being Mace Windu with a lightsaber in my hand,” he added. Jackson was previously honored with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” but the award ultimately went to Martin Landau for “Ed Wood.” He’s never been nominated for another performance since. The Marvel star said he believes he should have been recognized for at least two other Tarantino projects ― “Jackie Brown” and “Django Unchained” ― describing the latter film as his “best shot” for winning a trophy. “It’s the most evil character I’ve ever played and they generally reward Black people for playing horrendous s—,” he said. But Oscar-bait roles haven’t been what’s driven Jackson’s career so far. He’d much rather be known for starring in projects that “made me want to go to the movies when I was a kid.” “I’m satisfied because that’s who I am. I’m the guy who does the lines that people see on T-shirts,” he said. “There’s actors who go their whole careers and no one can quote a line they’ve said in a movie.” “People go to watch my movies to see how crazy I’m going to be or see how many times I say motherf—,” he added. “Whatever gets them in the seats.” His less-than-favorable opinion of the ceremony was only further soured by this year’s show, which left him a “little ticked” over a truncated tribute to the late Hollywood icon Sidney Poitier. “The greatest actor we had in Hollywood died and they gave him, what, 10 f— seconds,” Jackson said. “The reason Will Smith won an Oscar is because of this guy. The reason for Denzel [Washington], the reason for me, the reason for Danny [Glover], the reason for everybody is that guy, and he deserves more than 10 f— seconds of your time.” Jackson went on to blast the decision to instead give screen time to various athletes who introduced a tribute to James Bond onstage at the ceremony. “They have their show. They have the ESPYs. Go do that,” he said. “This is the night Hollywood celebrates f— Hollywood. That thing that we used to have when I was young, watching it and wondering, ‘What am I going to say when I get mine’ was the glamor of it all, the extravagance, the mystique that is Hollywood. Some of that’s gone.” Jackson recently appeared in the Apple TV+ limited series “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” and will soon make his return to the Marvel universe in two upcoming projects. First, he’ll star in the Disney+ series “Secret Invasion” alongside Ben Mendelsohn, Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke, before reuniting with Brie Larson in the upcoming Captain Marvel sequel “The Marvels,” which hits theaters in July 2023.

1,New Doc Examines 'Carol' Author Patricia Highsmith's Complex Love Life,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Author Patricia Highsmith achieved global fame with 1950’s “Strangers on a Train” and 1955’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” but a new documentary reveals her private life to have been even more multifaceted than her novels. Filmmaker Eva Vitija pored over many of Highsmith’s personal notes and diaries for “Loving Highsmith.” The film, which will be screened at the 2022 Provincetown International Film Festival in Provincetown, Massachusetts, this week ahead of a planned wider release, is a compelling look at Highsmith’s romantic relationships with women during her lifetime. A Texas native, Highsmith spent much of her adult life in Europe, settling in Switzerland. She died in 1995 at age 74, just four years before “The Talented Mr. Ripley” was adapted into a smash movie starring Matt Damon and Jude Law. The author drew heavily from her own life while writing 1952’s lesbian romance “The Price of Salt,” which was published under a pseudonym, Claire Morgan. In 1990, the book was republished as “Carol,” this time under Highsmith’s name. The book was the basis for the 2015 film starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Catch the “Loving Highsmith” trailer below. “Loving Highsmith” features interviews with several of Highsmith’s surviving girlfriends, and paints the author as a somewhat divisive figure in the queer literary canon. She is believed to have viewed homosexuality as a psychological defect and often mixed homoeroticism with homicide, most notably in “The Talented Mr. Ripley.” “Patrica Highsmith was a child of her time. And she wasn’t fighting for gay rights,” Vitija told Variety in April. “For her, love is such a brutal experience that extinguished her as a person that it is an experience of death, so murder is never far. In the love-scenes of ‘Carol’ and how she describes them, death is always around the corner.” Still, Vitija emphasizes that Highsmith’s “wildly romantic and poetic side” is the focal point of her film. “It was a Patricia Highsmith completely different from the one I was reading about in biographies or mainly articles in newspapers,” she said. The Provincetown International Film Festival will screen “Loving Highsmith” this Thursday and Saturday. Other highlights of the five-day event, which runs from Wednesday to Sunday, include the Sundance Audience Award winner “Cha Cha Real Smooth” and the gay romantic comedy “Fire Island,” starring Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang. Organizers say the festival will also showcase local filmmakers like Todd Flaherty, whose dark comedy “Chrissy Judy” will have its world premiere Thursday. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
2,"Yes, That's Emma Thompson As Miss Trunchbull In First 'Matilda The Musical' Trailer",entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sporting a Nicole Kidman-level nose prosthetic and yet another completely unnecessary fat suit, Emma Thompson is unrecognizable as Miss Trunchbull in the first trailer for “Matilda the Musical.” The Oscar-winner stars as the terrifying headmistress in Netflix’s upcoming adaptation of the Tony and Olivier Award-winning musical based on Roald Dahl’s beloved children’s book of the same name. While the first look at the project retreads over familiar territory (what’s a “Matilda” story without chocolate cake?), it provides a catchy rock score to the classic tale of the book-obsessed child prodigy, which, of course, also served as inspiration for the 1996 film adaptation of the novel. This big-screen treatment stars Alisha Weir as Matilda Wormwood, “an extraordinary girl who discovers her superpower and summons the remarkable courage, against all odds, to help others change their stories, whilst also taking charge of her own destiny,” per the official synopsis. She’s sent to attend the “ominous and oppressive” Crunchem Hall, which is ruled with an iron fist by the villainous Trunchbull, who hopes to rid the school of “rebels” one pigtailed student at a time. Luckily, Matilda finds solace in Miss Honey, played here by “Captain Marvel” star Lashana Lynch. In this version, Andrea Riseborough and Stephen Graham star as Matilda’s uncaring, money hungry parents, taking over the roles from Rhea Perlman and Danny DeVito, who also produced the 1996 film adaptation. “Harry Potter” alum Ralph Fiennes was attached to play Trunchbull before Thompson came aboard. The film reunites the creative team behind the musical, as Matthew Warchus and Dennis Kelly are on board to direct and write once again with original music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and choreography by Ellen Kane. “Matilda The Musical” is the latest project to arise from Netflix’s acquisition of the Roald Dahl Story Company, which granted the streaming service rights to create projects based on the author’s work across its platforms. The film arrives in theaters on Dec. 2 in the U.K., while a streaming release date has yet to be officially announced. Watch the trailer below. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Seth Meyers Has A Field Day With Giuliani's 'Diet Pepsi' Claim,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Seth Meyers refuses to believe anyone ― let alone Rudy Giuliani ― drinks Diet Pepsi by choice. “Rudy Giuliani wants you all to know he is very upset at the accusation leveled by former Trump aides in sworn testimony that he was wasted on election night,” the “Late Night” host said, referencing findings presented in Monday’s second hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. Aides said Giuliani, who was Donald Trump’s personal attorney at the time of the 2020 election, was inebriated when he advised the then-president to falsely declare victory while votes were still being counted. Giuliani tweeted after the hearing that he was “disgusted and outraged” by the accusation he was drunk. “I REFUSED all alcohol that evening. My favorite drink..Diet Pepsi,” he wrote. According to Meyers, that was Giuliani’s tell. “Sorry, buddy. You just gave yourself away. No one’s favorite drink is Diet Pepsi,” he quipped. “Is your favorite cookie Lorna Doones? Diet Pepsi is what you drink on a flight when they don’t have Diet Coke or lemonade or chocolate milk or coconut water or camel spit or regular Pepsi.” Watch more of his commentary below: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Former NFL Star Tony Siragusa Dies,entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
8,"Andrew Gillum, Former Candidate For Florida Governor, Facing Federal Charges",entertainment," TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, is facing 21 federal charges related to a scheme to seek donations and funnel a portion of them back to him through third parties, the U.S. attorney’s office announced Wednesday. Gillum, 42, and co-defendant Janet Lettman-Hicks, 53, face 19 counts of wire fraud. Gillum is also charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. attorney’s office said the pair “conspired to commit wire fraud, by unlawfully soliciting and obtaining funds from various entities and individuals through false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.” Lettman-Hicks then used her company to fraudulently give money to Gillum disguised as payroll payments, the office said in a press release. It’s the latest trouble for Gillum, who narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a race that required a recount. Gillum served as mayor of Tallahassee before running for governor. In March 2020, Gillum was found intoxicated and unconscious in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. Two days later he entered a rehabilitation center, and later did a television interview and said he’s bisexual. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

9,Man Who Filmed Self Screaming His Name In Capitol Riot Sentenced,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Former West Virginia state lawmaker Derrick Evans was sentenced to three months on Wednesday for his part in the U.S. Capitol attack last year. Evans had livestreamed himself joining the throng of Donald Trump supporters as some individuals smashed their way into the building and then opened the Rotunda doors for the rest of the mob. He narrated his exploits as he went along, shouting “Trump,” “The door’s cracked,” and “We’re goin’ in!” “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” he said once he made it though the doors. Evans later deleted the video, but it featured prominently in prosecutors’ case against him. After initially pleading not guilty, defending himself by saying he “committed no criminal act,” Evans took a plea deal. He told Judge Royce C. Lamberth that he accepts responsibility for his actions, seated nearby a large Evans family photo, according to NBC News. Lamberth reportedly wished Evans well, telling him that he considered sentencing Evans to six months behind bars. Evans’ attorney had asked for no jail time. “I just can’t give you probation in a case like this ... it doesn’t reflect the feeling in the country,” the judge said, according to CBS News reporter Rob Legare. “I don’t want another riot in the next election,” Lamberth added. At the time of the riot, the father of four had recently been elected to represent West Virginians in the state’s House of Delegates. Three days later, he was forced to resign. After releasing a very brief statement announcing his resignation, Evans released a second, slightly longer statement expressing regret, writing, “I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Ryan Gosling's Version Of Ken Is Giving Off Serious 'Earring Magic Ken' Vibes,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost The fact that the first photo of Ryan Gosling as “Ken” from the upcoming “Barbie” movie was released during Pride Month probably wasn’t a coincidence since he seems to resemble a version of the doll that has become a gay icon. Many people noticed that Gosling’s denim vest and bleached blond hair made him the spitting image of “Earring Magic Ken,” a version of Barbie’s best male friend, released in 1993. See the resemblance? “Earring Magic Ken” reportedly arrived at a time when Mattel executives were looking to update Ken’s image and surveyed children on what looked cool to them. However, the doll apparently became the bestselling version of Ken in Mattel history at the time thanks to its popularity with gay men. That’s because Earring Magic Ken wore his accessory earring on the left earlobe, a lavender mesh shirt with a matching pleather vest, and, as Mel Magazine noted, a necklace that could possibly double as a “cock ring.” That particular fashion accessory turned out to be particularly challenging for the Mattel PR person who had to explain it in a way that was acceptable to parents unfamiliar with what was stylish in the gay community at the time. Lisa McKendall, who was the manager of marketing and communications of Mattel Toys, insisted to The Chicago Reader that her employer was “not in the business of putting cock rings into the hands of little girls.” She added: “It’s a necklace. It holds charms he can share with Barbie. C’mon, this is a doll designed for little girls, something like that would be entirely inappropriate.” Although many moms bought Earring Magic Ken for their kids, it was also selling well in the gay community. But In the Know reported that after the article made the cock ring connection, Mattel recalled the doll. No one connected with the Barbie movie has explicitly connected Gosling’s version to Earring Magic Ken, but many people on Twitter couldn’t help but think it was intentional. I'm finding it interesting that they went with the Earring Magic Ken sans cockring for Ryan Gosling in this movie. https://t.co/cq3df8kh29 pic.twitter.com/I2bwqu9tsJ You can't tell me that Ryan Gosling Ken doesn't look like the infamous Earring Magic Ken. pic.twitter.com/5ZKgInsuKc 6/10. It looks A LOT like they're going for Earring Magic Ken, in which case he's missing the lilac mesh shirt and cock ring necklace. Which, given how badly Mattel wanted to bury that doll, means that the costume designer ABSOLUTELY needs to go all the way in that direction. This is Earring Magic Ken and it’s the correct choice of Ken to go with for this absolutely homosexual film. https://t.co/zpT9Lj4hpO Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Chris Evans Blasts Haters Upset Over Gay Kiss In ‘Lightyear’: ‘Those People Are Idiots’,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Chris Evans knows how to brush off the haters. The star of Disney and Pixar’s “Lightyear” dished out harsh words for the naysayers who claim the movie’s kissing scene between two female characters encourages a pro-gay agenda among children. “The real truth is those people are idiots,” Evans said in an interview with Reuters Television. “There’s always going to be people who are afraid and unaware and trying to hold on to what was before. But those people die off like dinosaurs. I think the goal is to pay them no mind, march forward and embrace the growth that makes us human.” “Every time there’s been social advancement as we wake up, the American story, the human story is one of constant social awakening and growth, and that’s what makes us good,” the leading man added. Evans voices the character Buzz Lightyear, whose intergalactic adventure inspires a sentient toy action figure with the same name in the long-running “Toy Story” franchise. The animated film has recently come under fire from conservatives who claim that the LGBTQ representation, including a scene with a same-sex married couple kissing, was purposely marketed to influence children. The scene in question occurs between Hawthorne, Buzz’s female best friend and commander voiced by Uzo Aduba, and another female character. On Monday, Variety reported that the scene would not be shown in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and certain other Asian countries, based on the inclusion of the same-sex kiss in the film. The UAE’s youth and culture ministry confirmed in a tweet that the spinoff “is not licensed for public screening in all cinemas in the UAE, due to its violation of the country’s media content standards.” The Media Regulatory Office announced that the animated film Lightyear, which is scheduled for release on 16th June, is not licensed for public screening in all cinemas in the UAE, due to its violation of the country’s media content standards. pic.twitter.com/f3iYwXqs1D Previously, Disney had reportedly nixed the scene from the film entirely, but reinstated it after receiving backlash from its employees for its inaction on Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, Variety reported in March. Disney CEO Bob Chapek apologized at the time for the media company’s failure to take a more forceful stand against the bill. “Speaking to you, reading your messages, and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,” Chapek wrote. “It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights.” “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down,” the chief executive added. “I am sorry.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the bill in March. It bans public school teachers in Florida from holding classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity. “Lightyear” is set to premiere in select theaters on Friday.

Brolin turned the reflective Q&A for Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series into a parody of celebrity sit-downs, from the reporter fawning to the actor’s self-importance. “Sorry, I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable,” says the baseball-cap-wearing version of Brolin. “It’s that when you respect somebody as much as I respect you ... Do you mind if I look at you in the eye, or do you want me to look down?” The other Brolin later complains with a straight face that his 1- and 3-year-old kids “are really trying to take the limelight from me right now and it’s tough, you know? I bring them to school, and when I’m walking down the street, when somebody says, ‘Hey, man, I love your work,’ it makes it all worth it for me.

14,"‘Lightyear’ Stays Earthbound, ‘Jurassic World’ Holds No. 1",entertainment," “Lightyear” did not go to infinity (or beyond) in its first weekend in theaters: Pixar’s first major theatrical release since March 2020 blasted off with $51 million in its first weekend in North America, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Not only did it open lower than expected, but it also failed to conquer “Jurassic World: Dominion,” which held on to the first-place spot with $58.7 million its second weekend. It is a mixed bag for Disney and Pixar as “Lightyear,” an origin story about the movie that inspired the space ranger action figure in the “Toy Story” movies, is one of the biggest launches for an animated family film over the pandemic. Including international showings, which grossed $34.6 million, “Lightyear’s” global opening weekend totals to $85.6 million. But expectations were higher for a release this high-profile and based on a beloved character. The family audience has proved a little more reluctant than other segments to return to movie theaters. Many studios, including Disney and Pixar, have opted for streaming or hybrid releases for their animated titles. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the company has sent its Pixar titles — “Soul,” “Luca,” and “Turning Red” — directly to Disney+ free for subscribers. Disney’s other big animated titles, “Raya and the Last Dragon” and “Encanto” got hybrid releases. Critics were mostly favorable to “Lightyear,” which features Chris Evans as Buzz Lightyear and a supporting voice cast that includes Keke Palmer and Taika Waititi. Directed by Angus MacLane, it currently holds a 77% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave it an A- CinemaScore. “Jurassic World: Dominion,” meanwhile, has now earned over $622.2 million worldwide with $259.2 million of that coming from U.S. and Canadian theaters. It’s only the seventh movie released during the pandemic to surpass $600 million. And in its fourth weekend, “Top Gun: Maverick” dropped only slightly, bringing in an additional $44 million. Its domestic total is now at $466.2 million. Globally, the high-flying sequel has grossed over $885 million."
15,'What Are You Talking About?!?': John Oliver Nails The Insanity Of GOP's Take On Guns,entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost John Oliver tore into Republicans on Sunday night for their usual response to mass shootings. “We all know what the key problem is here: It’s guns,” Oliver said. “It’s because we let basically whoever wants to buy a gun in this country have one, which has led to tragic consequences.” Most mass shooters ― including the gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last month ― obtain their weapons legally. “So, we know what the answer to this problem is, too: It’s gun control,” the host of “Last Week Tonight” said. “It’s meaningful, effective gun laws.” Yet Republicans are “desperately pitching” other solutions. Oliver then played clips of conservatives calling for everything from religion to “ballistic blankets” in schools. “What are you talking about?!?” Oliver asked. “Use a blanket is not a strategy for stopping deaths during a school shooting. It’s barely a strategy for ‘a bird got in the house.’” But one of the most common talking points ― especially from the right ― involves putting more police into schools, despite the fact that there are few instances of cops stopping would-be mass shooters. And in many instances, those same officers end up hurting the very kids they’re sworn to protect, especially children of color: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

He’s a fantastic actor.” Heard was sued for $50 million in damages over a 2018 opinion piece she published in The Washington Post about, in her words, becoming a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” The essay did not mention Depp by name but his attorneys argued that it indirectly referred to their marriage. .@savannahguthrie sat down for an exclusive conversation with #AmberHeard. ""You cannot tell me that you think that this has been fair,” Heard shared, in reference to social media representation. pic.twitter.com/56Ju7pYg1x Throughout the trial, jurors were instructed to stay off social media and not read related news coverage. They were not sequestered, however, and so Heard’s attorneys, without supporting evidence, have insisted that the jury was undoubtedly influenced by the posts and videos that flooded social media with hashtags like #justiceforjohnnydepp and #amberheardisguilty. Heard, who plans to appeal the verdict, emphasized this. “Even somebody who is sure I’m deserving of all this hate and vitriol, even if you think that I’m lying, you still couldn’t tell me — look me in the eye and tell me — that you think on social media there’s been a fair representation,” she told Guthrie. “You cannot tell me that you think that this has been fair.” Guthrie reminded Heard that the jury ultimately did not believe the evidence her attorneys presented or her testimony. Heard suggested that efforts to paint her as non-credible blinded the jury. #AmberHeard shares with @savannahguthrie that she doesn’t blame the jury: “I don’t blame them. I actually understand. He's a beloved character and people feel they know him. He's a fantastic actor."" pic.twitter.com/rjWY629MkG “How could they [believe me] after listening to three and a half weeks of testimony about how I was a non-credible person. Not to believe a word that came out of my mouth,” she said. Depp’s attorneys have denied that social media played any role in the jury’s decision, insisting that the jury came to its decision through the evidence presented. “I don’t think there’s any reason to believe that the jurors violated their oath,” attorney Ben Chew said in a previous interview with Guthrie. “This was a decision made by the jury on the evidence presented by both sides.” More of Heard’s interview with Guthrie is scheduled to air on Tuesday and Wednesday on NBC’s “Today.” An hourlong special will air Friday on “Dateline NBC” at 8 p.m./7 p.m. CT.

1,"Kim Kardashian Didn't Damage Marilyn Monroe's Dress, Ripley's Museum Says",entertainment," NEW YORK (AP) — Ripley’s Believe It or Not! on Thursday denied claims that Kim Kardashian’s wearing of the iconic Marilyn Monroe “Happy Birthday” dress left it with new damage. ChadMichael Morrisette, who owns a mannequin supply company and once handled the skintight sparkler briefly worn by Kardashian at the Met Gala, said he spotted fresh damage to the crystal-covered garment when he popped in for a look at a Ripley’s Los Angeles location. Morrisette shared photos taken on June 12 of the 60-year-old dress with a friend and fellow Monroe collector, who caused a stir earlier this week when he posted before and after shots on social media. “It makes me sad. I ran out in tears,” Morrisette told The Associated Press. Kardashian changed into a replica after climbing the Grand Staircase of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2. She wore the nude-colored dress for just a few minutes. Ripley’s purchased the dress for $4.8 million in 2016 at an auction. Morrisette said he was hired to stage Monroe memorabilia that included the look Monroe wore in 1962 to serenade then-President John F. Kennedy for his 45th birthday. “From the bottom of the Met steps, where Kim got into the dress, to the top where it was returned, the dress was in the same condition it started in,” Ripley’s Amanda Joiner, vice president of publishing and licensing, said in the statement. She was with the dress the day of the gala and during its transport from Orlando, Florida, where it was last displayed, to New York, according to Ripley’s. Morrisette’s photos, alongside pre-Met Gala images of the dress, lit up social media amid criticism at the time of the gala that Kardashian should not have been allowed to don the delicate and historically notable dress. It was made of a flammable fabric that is no longer on the market. Morrisette said he was stunned to see its condition. He said he saw the fabric stretched at the back zipper and hook enclosures with new hand-stitched crystals missing. He also said the shoulders appeared stressed. He said that level of damage wasn’t present the more than a dozen times he has viewed the dress over the years. Ripley’s said soon after the gala that care was taken in the handling of the dress and no alterations were allowed. Kardashian changed into a replica after reaching the top of the stairs. She kept the back of the dress hidden under a white jacket, leading to speculation the gown wasn’t zipped all the way up. According to Ripley’s, a report written on the dress’s condition in early 2017 states that “a number of the seams are pulled and worn. This is not surprising given how delicate the material is. There is puckering at the back by the hooks and eyes,” among other instances of damage. The dress adorned with more than 2,500 crystals was custom made for Monroe. It was based on a sketch by the famed designer Bob Mackie, working for the costumer Jean Louis at the time. Asked for Kardashian’s reaction to the damage controversy, a representative passed along Ripley’s statement with no additional comment. Ripley’s said it allowed Kardashian to wear the dress to keep Monroe’s legacy alive. “Our mission is to both entertain and educate visitors and fans, and sparking conversations like the discourse around Marilyn Monroe’s dress does just that,” the company said. “No matter which side of the debate you are on, the historical importance of the dress has not been negated, but rather highlighted. A entirely new group of young people have now been introduced to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe.” ___ Follow Associated Press journalist Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie"
2,Bryan Cranston Has A New Look And Twitter Is Loving It,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The internet is thrilled about Bryan Cranston’s transformation. On Tuesday, the actor sat down with “Today” hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager sporting a full, thick beard — and of course, people had questions. The typically clean-shaven Cranston didn’t hold back the humor, joking that he wanted to “make a pillow” using the hair from his beard. “I’m not shaving,” he said. Cranston said he grew out his beard to play his character Michael Desiato in the second season of Showtime’s “Your Honor.” The show follows a respected judge whose son is involved in a hit and run that involves an organized crime family. “The first season was about a man who loses his soul and sells his principles off for what he thought was the greater good,” Cranston said. “The second season of ‘Your Honor’ is really about redemption. Where can someone go? Is there a place for that kind of sincerity and apologies within our society?” The performer also showcased his beard at the Tony Awards on Sunday, which prompted a slew of gushing tweets from fans. Bryan Cranston with the beard can get it. #Tonys Bryan Cranston’s beard has arrived at #TonyAwards, and we welcome it. pic.twitter.com/zwfcwtWWrC Bryan Cranston’s beard is so majestic #TonyAwards pic.twitter.com/CxPFb8QpgE The actor said he has been learning “all these things about men with huge beards” while rocking his bushy look — namely, the fact that he can mimic a cartoon villain by twisting the ends of his mustache to make them curl upward. “It’s a Chia Pet, sort of,” Hager said, causing Cranston to nod in agreement. The Emmy Award-winning actor said he’ll begin shooting the drama series in a “couple of weeks.” Watch the trailer below. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Former NFL Star Tony Siragusa Dies,entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,Eric Swalwell Shares Recording Of Death Threat After Marjorie Taylor Greene Attack,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) shared an audio recording of a disturbing threat Wednesday that he said he received because of false statements made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “Marjorie loves to play the victim. But she’s an inciter of violence. Her constant attacks — even after the FBI said I was never suspected of wrongdoing — lead to threatening calls like this,” he tweeted alongside the audio clip. “This caller from today threatened to kill my three children.” In the recording, a man’s voice said: “Hey, you little cocksucker. You still banging the Chinese spy Fang Fang? ... We’re coming to your house this weekend. Gon’ get you and them little mutant bastards, them little mutant offspring of yours. We’re gon’ get ya.” Earlier Wednesday, Swalwell had shared a story about an interaction with a supporter of former President Donald Trump that happened while the congressman was giving a tour of the U.S. Capitol. He said a man shouted at him and then told his son, “That’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” Today I gave a tour in the Capitol and was stopped by a father with his young boy. The father yelled at me “Hey Swalwell” and then told his son, “that’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” I kept walking and felt sad for the boy. He’s being raised in a cult family. Greene responded to the tweet by saying there was “no way that happened.” “Because we all know good Trump supporting fathers would say, “that’s the Democrat who had sex with a Chinese spy,” she tweeted. Swalwell has been targeted by right-wing disinformation over his past connection to a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Fang Fang or Christine Fang. According to a 2020 Axios report, Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians in the Bay Area and the U.S., including Swalwell. Fang reportedly took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign and recommended an intern for his office. Federal investigators said they alerted Swalwell to their concerns in 2015 and he immediately cut all ties with Fang, Axios reported. He was not accused of any wrongdoing or of passing on any classified intelligence. Fang allegedly had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors. Swalwell was not accused of having sex with her. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Arkansas’ Israel Boycott Pledge Law Upheld By Appeals Court,entertainment," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

9,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Reports: Paul Haggis Detained In Italy In Sex Assault Case,entertainment," ROME (AP) — Film director Paul Haggis was detained on Sunday for investigation of allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in southern Italy, Italian news media said, quoting local prosecutors. The Canadian-born, Oscar-winning Haggis, 69, has been in Italy for a film festival that begins on Tuesday in Ostuni, a tourist town in Puglia, the region that forms the “heel” of the Italian peninsula. The news agency LaPresse and several other Italian media carried a written statement from prosecutors in the nearby city of Brindisi that they were investigating allegations a “young foreign woman” was forced to have “non-consensual” sexual relations over two days. Prosecutors Antonio Negro and Livia Orlando, who are conducting the investigation, said in the statement that the woman was “forced to seek medical care” following the sexual relations. After a couple of days “of non-consensual relations, the woman was accompanied by the man” to Brindisi airport on Sunday and “was left there at dawn despite (her) precarious physical and psychological conditions.” The Brindisi prosecutors’ office was closed on Sunday. Haggis’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The prosecutors said airport staff and police noticed her “obvious confused state” and ” and after lending initial treatment, took her to Brindisi’s police headquarters, where officers accompanied her to a local hospital for examination. Police at headquarters’ operations room said they weren’t authorized to give out information about the case, including whether Haggis was being held at the police station or at a hotel or other lodging. Haggis is a director, producer and screenwriter. He won an Oscar in 2006 for best original screenplay for “Crash.” Prosecutors also were quoted as saying that the woman “formalized her complaint and cited circumstances which were subsequently looked into for confirmation by investigators.” They didn’t cite her nationality or age."
11,Everyone Couldn't Stop Flirting With Andrew Garfield At The Tony Awards,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Quickly becoming the award show guest most likely to go viral, Andrew Garfield made quite the impression at the Tony Awards on Sunday night. Weeks after he was caught texting at the Oscars, spawning many a meme across social media, the “Spider-Man” star repeatedly stole the focus during Broadway’s biggest night, despite his best efforts to just get through the show. After arriving at the 75th annual ceremony in a double-breasted black velvet suit (more on that later), Garfield became an unsuspecting star in one of host Ariana DeBose’s musical numbers for the evening. Riffing on how audiences are forced to participate during award shows, the “West Side Story” star traipsed through the crowd at Radio City Music Hall before quite literally settling on the British actor. “I am close to you, oh so close to you / I am touching you, there’s not a lot that you can do,” DeBose belted, as she poked Garfield directly in the face, before sitting on his lap. Turning previously undiscovered shades of red, a blushing Garfield leaned into the bit, pulling DeBose in for a hug, while she continued to sing. NO BECAUSE THIS LEGITIMATELY WOULD BE ME IF I EVER SAW ANDREW GARFIELD #TonyAwards pic.twitter.com/sPwC0XpzOZ Eventually, DeBose moved on to other unsuspecting audience members, but Garfield wasn’t out of the woods just yet. Later in the evening, the actor took the stage with Nathan Lane to present the Tony Award for Best Play, which ultimately went to “The Lehman Trilogy.” The two starred together in 2017’s “Angels in America” revival, for which Garfield won the trophy for Best Actor in a Play and Lane took home the prize for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Seemingly abandoning whatever was written on the teleprompter, a looser-than-ever Lane opened the segment by joking that he’s been “pounding Jell-O shots with Chita Rivera all night.” “Andrew, look at you. Darling dear, Andrew Garfield ... I’ve missed you so much,” Lane continued, remarking that working together on the revival was one of the “highlights of my career” before praising his co-star’s work in the recent “Tick, Tick... Boom.” Lane then riffed on the film’s title at length, adding that he starred in a “much less successful film called “Boom, Boom... Tick” and joking that he played an “exotic dancer afflicted with a huge facial twitch.” An increasingly uncomfortable Garfield played along, as Lane spasmed on stage, before turning his attention back to the Marvel star. “I love a man in a velvet suit,” Lane added, as Garfield, stifling a major giggle fit, attempted to rein him in by announcing the category’s nominees.

Princess Charlotte was seen adorably correcting her older brother, Prince George, during their family balcony appearance on the last day of Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. On Sunday, Queen Elizabeth stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside her son Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; grandson Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; and their children, George, 8, Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4. As the national anthem, “God Save the Queen,” played, George was spotted placing his hand on the balcony ledge. Charlotte quickly noticed and slyly nudged her brother, appearing to say “Arms down, George!”​​ George then quickly drops his hand, places it by his side and stands up straight. You can watch the exchange in the video above. A similar moment took place Thursday, the first day of the jubilee, when the three great-grandchildren of the queen rode in a carriage with their mother and Duchess Camilla for the Trooping the Colour festivities. As they rode through the parade on a carriage, they all waved to the crowd. When they stopped waving, Louis enthusiastically continued to wave, causing Charlotte to place her hand on his hand and pull it down. Still, Louis took up his waving again just moments later, because, of course he did. As we’ve all witnessed during the jubilee, Louis can be quite the ham. Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Jennifer Lopez Gets Emotional Talking About Her 'Ride Or Die' At The MTV Movie & TV Awards,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jennifer Lopez let the emotions flow during her acceptance speech at the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards on Sunday. The “Marry Me” actor was honored with the Generation Award at the ceremony. According to the long-running cable channel, the coveted award “celebrates beloved actors whose diverse contributions to both film and television have turned them into household names.” “I look at those movies and I see all the wonderful people that I’ve been blessed to know and to work with. You’re only as good as the people that you work with,” Lopez said during her acceptance speech after a collection of clips from her 30-year-long career played.

As an actor, I’m not any of the women that I’ve played, but there’s a part of what is deeply true to me in each one of those characters,” she continued. Lopez, whose run in Hollywood has spanned TV, music, film and fashion, had a special message for her haters. “I want to thank all the people who told me to my face or when I wasn’t in the room that I couldn’t do this. I really don’t think I could have done it without you! And I know I couldn’t have done it without the fans,” she said during her speech. The New York actor went on to sing praises for her manager, Benny Medina, who she said was “the true meaning of ride or die.” Although Lopez rekindled her relationship with Ben Affleck last year and is currently engaged to him, he was not mentioned by name in her speech. Past recipients of the Generation Award include cinema heavy-hitters such as Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr., Adam Sandler, Sandra Bullock, Dwayne Johnson and Ben Stiller, among others. Lopez, who stars in “HALFTIME”, a documentary about her career, releasing on Netflix on June 14, also currently holds the title as the only artist to have a No. 1 album and No. 1 movie simultaneously.

It really should be called “They Did What-ergate?” because we learned today that Trump knew what he was trying to do was illegal and ― you’re not going to believe this ― he went ahead and did it anyway,” Kimmel said Thursday on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” following the third hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. “So it was the third of what will be six hearings, and they’re so dramatic, it’s hard to believe it isn’t scripted.” Kimmel then showed some of the most damning findings presented by the committee so far, set to the title theme from “Succession.” “Now, of course, the difference between Logan Roy and Donald Trump is Logan actually gave his son a birthday card, and Eric’s never had that,” he noted.

1,Halsey Covers Kate Bush’s ‘Running Up That Hill’ After ‘Stranger Things’ Resurgence,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost We’d like to imagine that Halsey spotted Sadie Sink in the crowd. The “Bad at Love” singer covered Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)” to the festival stage as the Saturday headliner for New York City’s Governors Ball Music Festival. The song has had a cultural resurgence thanks to heavy play and plot relevance on Season 4 of Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” insanity babes pic.twitter.com/ApexiTMLfM Not to give too much away, but in the latest season of the sci-fi series, Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) listens to Bush’s song on loop as she struggles to cope with the death of her brother, Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery), who died in Season 3. The song later reveals a weakness in the season’s new villain. Thanks to it playing numerous times on the show, “Running Up That Hill” has been sitting pretty at the top music charts since the show’s season premiered on May 27. It is currently number one on Spotify’s Top 50 U.S. charts, number two on Amazon, number four on iTunes  and number eight on Billboard’s Hot 100. So, it’s very much a thing. And it’s very cool that Bush’s song is resonating strongly with a new generation of fans. But, when it comes to songs getting repopularized thanks to films and movies, stranger things have happened. Queen’s 1975 song “Bohemian Rhapsody” became a huge hit in the 1990s when it was lip synced with gusto by a bunch of metal heads in 1992’s “Wayne’s World.” And thanks to a very sexy wheel-throwing scene (which feels like a strange sentence to write in and of itself) the Righteous Brothers’ 1965 song “Unchained Melody” also saw a surge due to 1990’s “Ghost.” Reporter, HuffPost"
2,'Get A Vasectomy': Khloe Kardashian Reacts To Tristan Thompson's Cheating Scandal,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Tristan Thompson’s second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chance officially ran out on “The Kardashians” season finale when Khloé Kardashian discovered with the rest of the world that he’d cheated on her once again. The reality TV star and the basketball player, who share 4-year-old daughter True, have had the rockiest of romances since they were first linked in 2016, due to Thompson’s multiple cheating scandals. But just when the two had put the past behind them, Thompson admitted in January that he had fathered a child with Maralee Nichols while he was still in a relationship with Kardashian. The fallout from the paternity bombshell was documented on Thursday’s episode of the family Hulu reality series, with the Good American designer learning about Thompson’s infidelity in real time. Kim Kardashian was the first to break the news to her sister, whom cameras catch sobbing on the other end of a phone call. “I find out what Tristan is doing with the rest of the world,” Khloé Kardashian said in a confessional interview. “A courtesy would be not doing it. But fine, if you do it, you’re not even gonna [give me] a fucking heads-up before the rest of the world? It’s just an additional slap in my face. It’s humiliating. I’m embarrassed.” “I’m replaying every event, every grand gesture, every trip, every date… all of that was a lie,” she continued. “I feel just not really in my own body; these things are just happening and I’m going through the motions. But when things happen to you a few times, you do kinda become immune to them, which is really sad.” Kardashian later said that she believes Thompson would’ve never come clean about his deception had there not been another child involved. His admission came only after Nichols sued for child support and the results of a paternity test revealed that the NBA player was indeed the child’s father. Nichols welcomed a baby boy in December 2021, which led Thompson to release an Instagram statement at the time in which he pledged to take “full responsibility for my actions” and apologized to “everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately.” Thompson also shares a son, Prince, born in December 2016, with ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig. “Everything is an act of betrayal, everything is a lie. It’s manipulation, it’s deceit,” Kardashian said in the episode. “The entire thing is despicable.” The season finale showed family members rallying around Kardashian, with each of them reacting to the news of Thompson’s behavior. Kim Kardashian is tempted to “put him on blast” and lashes out at the “trolls on the internet that make Khloé feel like the biggest piece of shit.” Momager Kris Jenner, meanwhile, called Thompson’s cheating “such a lack of respect” and a “pattern of bad behavior.” “This is not something that can be undone,” she continued. “If he’s in this pattern, why does she have to keep suffering? That’s what breaks my heart.” Thompson previously cheated on Kardashian days before she gave birth to their daughter back in 2018. A year later, the NBA player was caught cheating again with Kylie Jenner’s best friend, Jordyn Woods. The couple eventually reconciled again, only for reports to surface that Thompson was unfaithful at a birthday party in June 2021. #TheKardashians     #Kardashians     #Kardashiansonhulu      s1e10Khloe on Tristan:You either wear a condom, get a vasectomy, or you don’t f**k random people that you meet in other states.It is not like rocket science 🚀 🧪 pic.twitter.com/HlwySFLw0k Ultimately, Khloé Kardashian said that she’s “numb” to the all-too-familiar sense of betrayal from Thompson. She eventually reached out to him at the end of the episode, saying it was “more yelling on my end.” “You either wear a condom, get a vasectomy, or you don’t fuck random people that you meet in other states,” she said in a sit-down with Kim. “It’s not rocket science.” “There’s not much to talk about, in my opinion,” she continued. “It’s disgusting. We’re all over it. I didn’t buy tickets to this fucking circus, but somehow I’m watching all these clowns act out in front of me. I want a refund, return to sender, I don’t want to be at this show.” The episode marked the end of the 10-episode first season of the family’s new reality show on Hulu, which launched in April on the heels of “Keeping up with the Kardashians” coming to a close after 20 seasons on the E! network. But rest assured: More Kardashian drama is on the horizon, as Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, Kris, Kendall and Kylie have all signed on for at least two seasons, with 40 episodes slated overall.

3,David Harbour On Millie Bobby Brown: Fame At 11 ‘Is Really Hard For The Psyche’,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost David Harbour seems grateful that he found fame later in life. The Los Angeles Times’ podcast “The Envelope” recently asked the “Stranger Things” actor about his relationship with his co-star Millie Bobby Brown. The outlet recognized that “what the kids on the show and Millie in particular have gone through” by becoming child stars “is just remarkable.” Most of the kids on the hit Netflix series started on the show, which debuted in 2016, as preteens and were relatively unknown. But thanks to the popularity of “Stranger Things,” most of them — especially Brown — have become huge stars as teenagers. Harbour admitted that he worries whether his younger co-stars will know what it’s like to lead normal lives and what kinds of effects their fame could have on them. “Like I see what these kids have to deal with and, look, whatever. I mean, there’s a lot of people that go through, I guess a lot worse stuff,” Harbour said. “But mentally and psychologically, I think getting extremely famous and being so doted on at 11 years old is really hard for the psyche to reconcile with.” He then compared their experiences with his own. “I’m lucky because it didn’t happen to me ’til I was 40,” he said. “So I know what it’s like to go to the mall. I know what it’s like to be bullied and humiliated. … I know what it’s like to have to find friends, not to have people come to me. I don’t know that they’ll ever have that feeling.” He also admitted that his relationship with Brown isn’t as close as the one between their characters. Harbour’s character, Hopper — the former sheriff of a small Indiana town — acts as a father figure to Brown’s Eleven. Eleven is a girl with supernatural psychic powers who is arguably the central figure on the show. “That relationship is very, very — and she’s dependent on him in a way that Millie has a lot more people around her that she’s dependent on,” Harbour said. Brown has reached a level of celebrity that could be classified as “it girl” status. Thanks to her starring role in “Stranger Things,” she scored a role in Michael Dougherty’s “Godzilla” franchise. She was also able to produce and star in the successful “Enola Holmes,” a 2020 movie about the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes’ younger sister — with a sequel set to debut this year. She even launched her own vegan skin care line, Florence by Mills. But her fame has come at a cost. At 18, she’s experienced plenty of sexualization and has spoken out about being bullied online. She also received backlash for faking her skin care routine in an online video to promote her brand when she was only 15 years old — which she later apologized for. “I’m still learning the best way to share my routines as I get to know this space better — I’m not an expert,” the teenager wrote about the video at the time. She later disabled comments on the video on Instagram, which at the time had over 425,000 views. Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Former NFL Star Tony Siragusa Dies,entertainment," Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defense to a Super Bowl title, has died. He was 55. Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore’s 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defense that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. The Goose,Tony Siracusa has passed away at 55.. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation❤️🙏🏼🏈 Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. Siragusa came to Baltimore as a free agent in 1997 and teamed up with Adams to form an imposing defensive tackle tandem. In the Ravens’ 2000 championship season, the 6-foot-3, 340-pound Siragusa was sixth among Baltimore defenders with 75 tackles. He finished his career with 22 sacks. The news of Siragusa’s death came on what was already a tragic day for the Ravens. The death of Jaylon Ferguson, a linebacker for Baltimore, at age 26 was announced earlier in the day."
7,Eric Swalwell Shares Recording Of Death Threat After Marjorie Taylor Greene Attack,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) shared an audio recording of a disturbing threat Wednesday that he said he received because of false statements made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “Marjorie loves to play the victim. But she’s an inciter of violence. Her constant attacks — even after the FBI said I was never suspected of wrongdoing — lead to threatening calls like this,” he tweeted alongside the audio clip. “This caller from today threatened to kill my three children.” In the recording, a man’s voice said: “Hey, you little cocksucker. You still banging the Chinese spy Fang Fang? ... We’re coming to your house this weekend. Gon’ get you and them little mutant bastards, them little mutant offspring of yours. We’re gon’ get ya.” Earlier Wednesday, Swalwell had shared a story about an interaction with a supporter of former President Donald Trump that happened while the congressman was giving a tour of the U.S. Capitol. He said a man shouted at him and then told his son, “That’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” Today I gave a tour in the Capitol and was stopped by a father with his young boy. The father yelled at me “Hey Swalwell” and then told his son, “that’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” I kept walking and felt sad for the boy. He’s being raised in a cult family. Greene responded to the tweet by saying there was “no way that happened.” “Because we all know good Trump supporting fathers would say, “that’s the Democrat who had sex with a Chinese spy,” she tweeted. Swalwell has been targeted by right-wing disinformation over his past connection to a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Fang Fang or Christine Fang. According to a 2020 Axios report, Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians in the Bay Area and the U.S., including Swalwell. Fang reportedly took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign and recommended an intern for his office. Federal investigators said they alerted Swalwell to their concerns in 2015 and he immediately cut all ties with Fang, Axios reported. He was not accused of any wrongdoing or of passing on any classified intelligence. Fang allegedly had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors. Swalwell was not accused of having sex with her. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Arkansas’ Israel Boycott Pledge Law Upheld By Appeals Court,entertainment," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

9,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Vivica A. Fox Unloads On Jada Pinkett Smith For 'No Accountability' In Slap,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost “Kill Bill” actor Vivica A. Fox criticized Jada Pinkett Smith for taking “no accountability” for Will Smith’s slap of Chris Rock at the Oscars. (Watch the video below.) Pinkett Smith, whose shaved head was the butt of Rock’s Academy Awards joke riling Will Smith, called on the two men to talk it out and reconcile during a “Red Table Talk” this week. But Fox blasted her comments as “cold” and “self-righteous” on Thursday’s “Wendy Williams Show.” “Will Smith was defending her honor, that’s the reason he walked on stage and slapped because he felt like his wife had been offended,” Fox said, adding that Pinkett Smith has expressed “no accountability as a partner.” “Also, let’s not forget, Chris Rock was assaulted. We cannot forget that for basically telling a joke that I really felt wasn’t that bad,” she continued. Fox, who noted that she starred in “Independence Day” with Smith and “Set It Off” with Pinkett Smith, elaborated: “I have love for the Smiths. I know their children. I’ve watched them grow up. I just wish we could have had just a little more accountability and for it to not seem so self-righteous on Jada’s part, and that’s my feelings.” A post shared by Wendy Williams (@wendyshow) Will Smith and Rock have been the talk of Hollywood since the “King Richard” actor slapped Rock onstage at the Oscars in March for telling a “G.I. Jane” joke about his wife’s shaved head. Pinkett Smith has experienced hair loss because of alopecia. Smith was banned for 10 years from the ceremony. “Now, about Oscar night, my deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile,” Pinkett Smith said on “Red Table Talk” this week. “The state of the world today, we need them both, and we all actually need one another more than ever. “Until then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that’s keep figuring out this thing called life together,” Pinkett Smith continued.

11,Stephen Colbert Names The 'Dumbest Person Ever To Sit In The United States Senate',entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Stephen Colbert gave one U.S. lawmaker a scathing new distinction on Wednesday. “Most historians agree: Ron Johnson is the dumbest person ever to sit in the United States Senate,” Colbert declared on “The Late Show.” Newly revealed text messages showed the Wisconsin Republican’s chief of staff tried to arrange a meeting in which Johnson would hand-deliver a slate of fake electors to then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence’s office declined. This week, Johnson claimed “some staff intern” wanted an envelope delivered to the vice president and his office tried to arrange it but he didn’t know who sent it or what it was, according to The Washington Post. Colbert was incredulous: “So, he has no idea where it came from, no idea who gave it to them, no idea what it is, but he can’t wait to hand-deliver it to the second-in-command. There could’ve been anything in that envelope, he doesn’t care: fake electors, angry bees, naked pictures of Mary Todd Lincoln. It don’t matter to Ron! He’s just a delivery boy.” Colbert also said this situation answered a question he’d always had. “You know those announcements in the airport when they say, ‘Do not carry onto the flight a package for someone you don’t know’? I’ve always wondered who those announcements are for,” he said. “Turns out it’s Ron Johnson.” See his full takedown below: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"

Four collectible box sets are now available to purchase on the singer’s website and will include a CD, T-shirt, poster and a 28-page photo booklet promised to start “shipping July 29 upon album release.” Along with the album drop announcement, the 28-time Grammy Award winner appeared on the cover of British Vogue in a suitably lavish fashion spread to hail the arrival of a new musical era. A post shared by TIDAL (@tidal) BEYONCÉ | ACT I | RENAISSANCE | 16 tracks.July 29. pic.twitter.com/7q26zZo0ya In the cover story, the magazine’s editor-in-chief Edward Enninful describes listening to the new album for the first time. “Soaring vocals and fierce beats combine and in a split second I’m transported back to the clubs of my youth,” Enninful writes. “I want to get up and start throwing moves. It’s music I love to my core. Music that makes you rise, that turns your mind to cultures and subcultures, to our people past and present, music that will unite so many on the dance floor, music that touches your soul. As ever with Beyoncé, it is all about the intent.” Creating the album during the pandemic was a “long process,” Enninful says the singer explained to him. That mirrors what Beyoncé herself said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar last year. “I’ve been in the studio for a year and a half. Sometimes it takes a year for me to personally search through thousands of sounds to find just the right kick or snare,” she told the outlet. “One chorus can have up to 200 stacked harmonies. Still, there’s nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio.” And in peak Beyoncé fashion, she mentioned the word “renaissance” in the same conversation, reminding us that she is always many, many, many steps ahead of the rest of us. “I feel a renaissance emerging, and I want to be part of nurturing that escape in any way possible,” she said at the time. Rumors have been swirling for weeks about another album release after the singer removed her profile picture from all of her social media pages. 🚨Beyoncé has removed her profile pictures across all social media accounts. pic.twitter.com/jzjXYFWgI3 And, while Beyoncé has yet to unveil the album cover for “Renaissance,” some fans are convinced she snuck the image into a collage of album covers released by her BeyGOOD Foundation earlier this month. The image in question ― a gloved red hand ― is positioned next to Brandy’s album “B7,” which many speculated was a reference to “Renaissance” being Beyoncé’s seventh album.

13,'My Policeman' Has Harry Styles As Closeted Gay Cop Caught Up In 1950s Love Triangle,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Harry Styles finds himself ensnared “in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness” in the first teaser for “My Policeman,” a romantic drama due out this fall. Based on the novel by Bethan Roberts, “My Policeman” follows Tom Burgess (played by Styles), a closeted gay cop who begins a secret relationship with a museum curator, Patrick Hazelwood (David Dawson). Faced with the societal pressures of 1950s England, Tom is unable to embrace his truth, and marries a woman, Marion (Emma Corrin). Actors Linus Roache, Gina McKee and Rupert Everett portray older versions of Tom, Marion and Patrick, respectively, as “My Policeman” catches up with this trio of characters in the 1990s, when they are “still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past,” according to press notes. Catch the teaser for “My Policeman” below. Directed by Michael Grandage, “My Policeman” is one of two major acting projects in store for Styles this fall. In September, the Grammy winner will be seen in “Don’t Worry Darling,” directed by his girlfriend Olivia Wilde and co-starring Florence Pugh. Appearing on “The Howard Stern Show” last month, Styles said shooting “My Policeman” made him feel “vulnerable,” but denied rumors he would bare all in the film. “I think the most important thing in that stuff is trust,” he said. “I’d never kissed anyone on camera before and it felt like giving a part of myself away in some ways ... There’s no peen in the final cut. The peen, it was pre-negotiated that that would remain my own.” “The whole point of Tom is that he is a character who is confused,” Grandage told Vanity Fair in an interview published last week. “It’s made more problematic by the fact that he’s a policeman, and he’s in a career that is about upholding the law. And the law in the country at the time is about everything he feels — the complexity of it is something that whoever was going to play younger Tom and older Tom needed to somehow understand and absorb.” “My Policeman” hits theaters Oct. 21. The film will be available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video Nov. 4. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Jennifer Lopez Felt Sharing Super Bowl Stage With Shakira Was 'Worst Idea In The World',entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost For fans, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira’s 2020 Super Bowl halftime show was a peak cultural moment in a year that came to be defined by both political divisions and a pandemic. Lopez, however, had a much different opinion on the massively hyped performance ― or at least she did in the days leading up to it. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” the actor and singer is shown in rehearsals with her music director Kim Burse and appears visibly stressed over the time constraints. “We have six fucking minutes,” Lopez proclaims, according to Entertainment Weekly. “We have 30 seconds of a song, and if we take a minute, that’s it, we’ve got five left. But there’s got to be certain songs that we sing, though. We have to have our singing moments. It’s not going to be a dance fucking revue. We have to sing our message.” “This is the worst idea in the world to have two people do the Super Bowl,” she continues. “It was the worst idea in the world.” Elsewhere in “Halftime,” Lopez doesn’t hold back as she maps out the logistics of the show with Shakira directly. “If it was going to be a double-headliner, they should have given us 20 minutes,” she says. “That’s what they should’ve fucking done.” Catch the trailer for “Halftime” below. In the end, Lopez and Shakira’s performance lasted about 14 minutes. By comparison, Madonna in 2012 and Lady Gaga in 2017 were each given about 14 minutes to perform in the Super Bowl show. This year’s halftime show, featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar, clocked in at nearly 14 minutes. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to EW. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” In spite of their limited stage time, Lopez and Shakira each turned in a dazzling performance that won raves from critics and even managed to deliver a subtle political message. The Los Angeles Times applauded the divas for having “fused old-school razzle-dazzle with an of-the-moment sense of Latin American pride,” while Entertainment Weekly called it “punchy, political, and flat-out electric.” “Halftime,” which premiered Wednesday at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York, follows Lopez as she “reflects on her milestones and evolution as an artist, and navigates the second half of her career continuing to entertain, empower and inspire,” according to press notes. It’s now available for streaming on Netflix. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"

Cruise is possibly the organization’s most famous member, while Remini, who was raised a Scientologist, is known for being one of its biggest critics thanks to a book and docuseries on the topic. “Don’t let the movie star charm fool you,” Remini wrote over the weekend.

1,‘Stranger Things’ Creators Admit They Made Huge Continuity Error In Season 4,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) may have gotten a ton of attention from his loved ones when he was stuck in the Upside Down on “Stranger Things.” But not so much on his birthday. Warning: spoilers for Season 4 of “Stranger Things” below. Viral tweets have pointed out that the show’s characters seem to have forgotten about Will’s birthday in Season 4. Now, Matt and Ross Duffer, co-creators of the Netflix smash hit, have responded in an interview with Variety. “The honest response is, clearly like the characters in the show, we also forgot about Will’s birthday,” Matt Duffer said. “So the debate now is whether we adjust Will’s birthday or we just let it be really sad.” When the fourth season of the sci-fi series debuted on May 27, it didn’t take fans long to notice that on the day that should have been Will’s birthday, he was ignored by his best friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard), witnessed Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) assault her bully with a roller skate, and was told by his mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) that she was leaving on a last-minute trip to Alaska without any acknowledgment of his birth. Hard-core fans of the show understood Will’s birthday to be March 22, due to a scene in the second season in which Joyce tells Will a personal story about his birthday to save him from the Mind Flayer’s control. wait they forgot will’s birthday omg :( pic.twitter.com/Lwu448JKku Fast-forward to Season 4, Episode 2. In a scene where Will, Mike and Eleven go to a skating rink, Eleven’s school bullies decide to pull a cruel “Carrie”-esque prank on her, which they record on a camcorder. When the scene is shown from the camcorder’s perspective, it’s time-stamped March 22, 1986 — which means the horrible scene occurred on Will’s birthday. This was a shock to fans who remembered the date. Plus, as we mentioned before, it was a bummer of a day for poor Will: the saddest shit about this stranger things season is that absolutely NO ONE remembered will's birthday.NO ONE pic.twitter.com/UwaEeay4pq Stop i just realized the day mike arrived in california was will’s birthday and they forgot abt it good fucking bye so not only EVERYONE forgot about will's birthday, he also had to deal with mike telling him that he ruined the day and joyce saying that she was leaving to alaska, wow well done duffer brothers you just showed that you hate your own character stranger things continuity issues keep piling up omg. will byers has 2 diff. birthdays + the duffers forgot them both. steve was said to only play basketball but then wait a minute he was captain of the swim team too? eddy is a 4x senior but somehow was in 8th grade w/ chrissy. wait what if will looked this happy because he thought mike was going to remember his birthday? pic.twitter.com/WhcXuEr6NA “It was six years ago that I wrote that date!” Ross Duffer told Variety. He later added: “Of course that would mean his mom forgot his birthday! It’s too mean. It was obviously a mistake, and we’re sorry. We apologize to the fans.” Matt Duffer said the show does not have someone making sure there are no continuity errors. “You know how George R.R. Martin has somebody — I mean, his story is more vast — and Stephen King has someone who just keeps track of this stuff?” Matt Duffer said. “We need that. We don’t have that.” He added: “We love Will, and I don’t want people to think we don’t love Will because we forgot — we do! But now we mentioned Dustin’s birthday this season, so we’re being very careful for people not to forget, in case the timelines…” The Duffer Brothers then joked about how they could fix the continuity error by going back and dubbing in another month for Will’s birthday. “We’re thinking his new birthday … is going to be May 22nd, because ‘May’ can fit in Winona’s mouth [in the Season 2 scene]. So that would be us George Lucas-ing the situation.” Sure, but don’t go George Lucas-ing it too much. We don’t need the Duffer Brothers to have Joyce needlessly scream “May,” for instance.

2,Kim Cattrall’s Samantha Jones Returns In ‘And Just Like That’ Season 2 ... Kinda,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost “And Just Like That” fans will still be able to keep up with the Jones next season. As in Kim Cattrall’s Samantha Jones. Michael Patrick King, showrunner of the HBO Max “Sex and the City” reboot, told Variety this week that the character made famous by Cattrall will continue to “appear” through text message exchanges with Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw. The two appeared to work on patching up their friendship in the first “AJLT” season through long-distance texts. Carrie and Samantha arranged to meet for cocktails after Carrie disposed of Big’s ashes in the Seine during the finale. “It’s very funny, because every single one of the writers has a different version of what happened during that conversation,” King said of the offscreen get-together. “So, I think there was some champagne. I think there was a grownup back and forth, and a love affair that they realized that something’s more important than being afraid to heal,” King told Variety. “I’m sure they had a great night. To me, they had a great night and things became resolved. Once Carrie let go of an old, old love, one of her current loves came back in.” But life is far from imitating art. Cattrall has apparently sworn off the franchise and rejected a script for a third “Sex and the City” movie amid reported feuding with Parker. As for her continued absence from the franchise, she recently alluded to it by noting the power of saying “no.” Cattrall said she wasn’t invited back anyway. Parker said earlier this year that she wouldn’t want Cattrall back because there’s “too much public history” of her negative sentiments. “I have no realistic expectation of Kim Cattrall ever appearing again,” King said previously. But even phantom Samantha is better than no Samantha at all, right? General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Kim Kardashian Discusses Pete Davidson's 'BDE' And It Gets A Little Hot In Here,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian said she was lured in by Pete Davidson’s “BDE” and her readiness to have sex ― and had no intention of building a longer-term relationship with the comedian. On “The Kardashians” Thursday, the reality queen explained that when she kissed the former “Saturday Night Live” star in an “Aladdin” sketch last fall, she felt a “vibe.” She hoped to pursue the matter further at her “SNL” after-party, but Davidson did not attend, BuzzFeed noted. So Kardashian asked an “SNL” producer for Davidson’s number. “I text him,” she said, per People. “I wasn’t even thinking like, ‘Oh my God, I’m gonna be in a relationship with him.’ I was just thinking, ’Heard about this BDE, need to get out there.” BDE, of course, is short for big dick energy. “I was just basically DTF,” or down to fuck, she confided. But their bond deepened. And now, Kardashian said, even her beau’s sense of humor doesn’t figure as prominently as many might think. “That’s, like, fourth on my list on why I like him,” she said, per Billboard. “He always wants the best for people, can handle anything, always does it with grace. He’s really, really thoughtful and humble and genuine. I would say the best word to describe Pete is genuine.” Good to know ― as is the eyewitness account of former Davidson fiancee Ariana Grande.

4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

6,Eric Swalwell Shares Recording Of Death Threat After Marjorie Taylor Greene Attack,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) shared an audio recording of a disturbing threat Wednesday that he said he received because of false statements made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “Marjorie loves to play the victim. But she’s an inciter of violence. Her constant attacks — even after the FBI said I was never suspected of wrongdoing — lead to threatening calls like this,” he tweeted alongside the audio clip. “This caller from today threatened to kill my three children.” In the recording, a man’s voice said: “Hey, you little cocksucker. You still banging the Chinese spy Fang Fang? ... We’re coming to your house this weekend. Gon’ get you and them little mutant bastards, them little mutant offspring of yours. We’re gon’ get ya.” Earlier Wednesday, Swalwell had shared a story about an interaction with a supporter of former President Donald Trump that happened while the congressman was giving a tour of the U.S. Capitol. He said a man shouted at him and then told his son, “That’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” Today I gave a tour in the Capitol and was stopped by a father with his young boy. The father yelled at me “Hey Swalwell” and then told his son, “that’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” I kept walking and felt sad for the boy. He’s being raised in a cult family. Greene responded to the tweet by saying there was “no way that happened.” “Because we all know good Trump supporting fathers would say, “that’s the Democrat who had sex with a Chinese spy,” she tweeted. Swalwell has been targeted by right-wing disinformation over his past connection to a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Fang Fang or Christine Fang. According to a 2020 Axios report, Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians in the Bay Area and the U.S., including Swalwell. Fang reportedly took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign and recommended an intern for his office. Federal investigators said they alerted Swalwell to their concerns in 2015 and he immediately cut all ties with Fang, Axios reported. He was not accused of any wrongdoing or of passing on any classified intelligence. Fang allegedly had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors. Swalwell was not accused of having sex with her. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Siragusa’s broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. “This is a really sad day,” he said. “Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony’s loved ones.” Siragusa, known as “the Goose,” played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens.

8,Arkansas’ Israel Boycott Pledge Law Upheld By Appeals Court,entertainment," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

9,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
10,Dave Chappelle Reveals 'Very Fitting Goodbye' Last Time He Saw Norm Macdonald,entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Comedy icon Dave Chappelle opened up about the last time he saw his friend, fellow comedian Norm Macdonald ― who died last year of cancer at the age of 61 ― and the photo that resulted. It was taken at the Comedy Store in Hollywood during what would be their last meeting. “[Macdonald] was uncharacteristically emotional,” Chappelle said during a discussion that’s featured in Macdonald’s posthumous Netflix special, “Norm Macdonald: Nothing Special.” Chappelle said he included the picture of that meeting in his own special, “The Closer,” which was released last year and dedicated to Macdonald. Chappelle didn’t realize it at the the time, but Macdonald was giving him “a very fitting goodbye.” (h/t digg) Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
11,Jimmy Kimmel Presents 'Drunk Giuliani' Compilation After Jan. 6 Panel's Detail,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost There’s no way late-show hosts weren’t going to pounce on this detail from the Jan. 6 House select committee hearings. Jimmy Kimmel’s team promptly offered up a compilation Monday after the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol revealed that on the night of the 2020 election, Donald Trump falsely declared victory on the advice of his drunk personal attorney, even though votes were still being counted. “President Trump rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night, and instead followed the course recommended by an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani to just claim he won and insist the vote-counting stop, to falsely claim everything was fraudulent,” committee co-chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said at Monday’s proceedings. Cheney’s comments were followed by video testimony from former Trump aide Jason Miller, who said Giuliani was “definitely intoxicated” when they spoke that night. “Everyone pretty much told Trump he lost, but he didn’t want to hear that. He wanted to hear what Rudy Giuliani told him,” Kimmel said. “And how would Trump know Giuliani was drunk? I mean, does this seem like a drunk person to you?” Check out the compilation below on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Seth Meyers Highlights 'Bonkers' Jan. 6 Texts That 'Make Mike Lindell Look' Normal,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Seth Meyers was blown away by “bonkers” texts from the wife of a Supreme Court justice to former President Donald Trump’s team during his crusade to overturn the 2020 election. The House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack said Thursday it had requested an interview with Ginni Thomas, wife of Clarence Thomas. That followed revelations Wednesday that the committee is in possession of emails between Ginni Thomas and attorney John Eastman, a key adviser in Trump’s effort to overturn the election results. Previously revealed text messages showed Ginni Thomas repeatedly contacted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with false and outlandish claims about electoral fraud in November 2020, including one in which she claimed a group of co-conspirators including the “Biden crime family,” elected officials, “social media censorship mongers” and others were being arrested and detained and would soon be “living in barges off GITMO [Guantanamo Bay detention camp] to face military tribunals for sedition.” To Meyers, this sounded even crazier than MyPillow CEO and notorious election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell. “Those texts make Mike Lindell sound like a levelheaded businessman,” Meyers quipped on “Late Night.” “I know those texts all sound insane to you. But it’s important to remember. They really are fucking insane,” he said. “I think my favorite part is when she says the Biden crime family and ballot fraud co-conspirators will be living in barges of Gitmo. Obviously, all this stuff is bonkers, but I am curious about one thing. Why would they live in a barge off Gitmo? Like why wouldn’t they just be sent to Gitmo?” Watch below on “Late Night.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Ana De Armas Channels Iconic Marilyn Monroe Moments In First Trailer For 'Blonde',entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Ana de Armas may not wear an actual dress of Marilyn Monroe’s in “Blonde,” but she does a good job of filling her shoes. That’s based on the first trailer for the upcoming Netflix biopic about the iconic sex symbol, released on Thursday. The “official teaser” shows de Armas channeling some of Monroe’s most famous moments, including her rendition of “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” from “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” However, de Armas is not seen singing “Happy Birthday” to John F. Kennedy. The film’s synopsis describes it as a bold reimagination of the life of “one of Hollywood’s most enduring icons,” from a volatile childhood as Norma Jeane Mortenson, through her rise to stardom and romantic entanglements. De Armas told Netflix Queue that director Andrew Dominik told her he wanted the world “to experience what it actually felt like to not only be Marilyn, but also Norma Jeane.” She added, “I found that to be the most daring, unapologetic, and feminist take on her story that I had ever seen.” The film is based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel of the same name. De Armas said she prepared for the role by studying “hundreds of photographs, videos, audio recordings, films — anything I could get my hands on.” Every scene in the film is inspired by an existing photograph, and de Armas said she and Dominik would pore over every detail in each photo and debate what was happening in it. “The first question was always, ‘What was Norma Jeane feeling here?’ We wanted to tell the human side of her story. Fame is what made Marilyn the most visible person in the world, but it also made Norma the most invisible.” The NC-17 film debuts on the streaming platform Sept. 23, and Dominik told Vulture that it has “something in it to offend everyone.” You can see the trailer below.

14,Nick Cannon — Soon-To-Be Dad Of 8 — Makes ‘Vasectomy’ Cocktail In Ad With Ryan Reynolds,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Nick Cannon appears tired — yet self-aware — in a very funny Father’s Day ad for Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin. In the commercial, which was uploaded to Reynolds’ YouTube page Wednesday, Cannon shows viewers how to make a cocktail called “The Vasectomy.” “Lord knows I need one,” he says in the ad. The former “America’s Got Talent” host announced this week that he is expecting to expand his brood of children (seven with at least one on the way) even more later this year. Throughout the tutorial, Cannon appears to be exhausted — spilling ice and watching a bottle of tonic explode as he unscrews the cap. This makes perfect sense because Cannon shares 11-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe with ex-wife Mariah Carey; a son, Golden, and daughter, Powerful Queen, with model Brittany Bell; son Zen, who died last year at age 5 months, with model Alyssa Scott; and twins Zion and Zillion, who were also born last year, with DJ Abby De La Rosa. (We got tired just listing all those children!) In January, he announced that he is expecting his eighth child later this year with model Bre Tiesi. In a podcast interview released Tuesday, he implied even more children are on the way. “If you thought it was a lot of kids last year...” Cannon joked. This may explain why Cannon deploys Reynolds’ trademark snark so effectively in the ad, talking about the different ingredients in the cocktail and how they relate to parenthood. As Cannon finishes adding the ingredients to the drink, he concludes with what is supposed to be 1.5 ounces of Aviation Gin but instead free-pours half the bottle into his glass. “The world’s highest-rated gin for the highest-rated job … Dad,” Cannon says as the gin overflows from the glass. Once the cocktail is topped with a garnish, Reynolds makes an appearance. “I’ll take it from here, Nick,” Reynolds says, grabbing the cocktail. “I have three kids.” Reynolds proceeds to chug the drink, while Cannon says in a matter-of-fact way: “I have eight.” To see how Reynolds hilariously responds, check out the video above.

15,"What “Good Luck To You, Leo Grande” Star Daryl McCormack Understands About Intimacy",entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter This article contains spoilers for “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.” It’s not every day that a young actor gets the opportunity to lead a film with Emma Thompson — much less a deeply intimate two-hander shot during lockdown that demands an unflinching level of emotional and physical vulnerability. But after just a few minutes of conversation with Daryl McCormack, it’s easy to see why he was cherry-picked to play the sensitive sex worker hired by Thompson’s retired English teacher in “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.” Because McCormack, 29, exudes many of the same qualities his character shares: assured and earnest yet quietly reserved, masculine yet sees the world through a disarmingly feminist lens. These might have also also been traits Thompson, 63, noticed because shortly after going on a walk with the actor following his auditions, she knew that he was the right fit for the titular role. “Emma messaged me, and was like, ‘Hey, I want you to be Leo,’” McCormack said on a video call from his hotel room in London. “So, within five days, I went from reading a script to being like, ‘Oh, my God. Now I’m going to go ahead and do this.’ My world just flipped upside down.” That’s an understatement, especially if you’re only familiar with McCormack from his role as gun-wielding gang member Isaiah Jesus on “Peaky Blinders.” Even since helping “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” directed by Sophie Hyde and written by Katy Brand, become the darling of the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, the actor has been consistently busy. He reprised his role on “Peaky Blinders,” is currently shooting a film in Hamburg, had just celebrated the London premiere of “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” the night before we spoke and was about to fly out to New York the following week. In fact, McCormack has barely had a moment to eat, which is why our conversation was momentarily interrupted by a doorbell when his order of soup and sandwiches arrived. “My bad,” he said with a conciliatory laugh as he set the bag down next to him. Still, he remained present throughout our chat, considering each question as he reflected on his experience shooting the charming “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” in a mere 19 days after only one month to prepare, during which he researched sex work and talked to real-life sex workers. The insight that both he and Hyde, who joined him in those conversations, gained from that groundwork was incorporated into the character and the film. And in many ways, Leo subverts popular depictions of sex work on-screen — from “Midnight Cowboy” and “Klute” to “Hung” and even this year’s “Pleasure,” to a certain extent. “We see portrayals of sex work on-screen, but it’s not always empowering,” McCormack said. “It’s often diminishing.” That’s because there’s often a sense of danger lurking around every turn and/or the character has limited agency. Leo, on the other hand, has full authority over who he is, his job and his sexuality. When McCormack first read the script, he saw “a portrayal of a young man who’s really in touch with his own sense of intimacy and sexuality. I haven’t really seen young men like that portrayed on-screen, and it didn’t feel false to me.” It was really important to both him and Hyde that Leo instilled those same virtues in his clients. That includes Nancy (Thompson), who admits that even during a decadeslong marriage to her late husband and after two children, she’s never experienced an orgasm of her own. “I just felt this film was giving an audience a chance to witness that there’s a scope to sex work,” McCormack continued. “And there’s a capacity to be of real value in that work.” But as the film emphasizes, that purpose is defined by the client herself. Despite Nancy finally giving herself permission to achieve sexual pleasure by going through the motions of hiring a sex worker, when Leo arrives in her hotel room, she is riddled with self-doubt. Instead of immediately having sex with him, Nancy is self-deprecating and tries to talk herself out of her own plan, even offering to give Leo a refund. She laments she might be “disappointed again” if he isn’t able to get her to come, or that maybe he might be, fears she might be using the young man, and refuses to believe him when he calls her “empirically sexy.” In other words, Nancy’s instinctual response to the idea of affording herself sexual pleasure is to downplay her appeal or that she’s somehow exploiting Leo for her own gain. To which he responds that she’s not “using” him, but rather “hiring him for her own pleasure.” The idea of autonomy is mind-altering for her. “Isn’t it interesting that she’s garnering that information from a young man — and that her damaged experience of intimacy has been the result of being with a man who didn’t understand it, couldn’t offer her what she wanted, and didn’t maybe even see it as important?” McCormack pondered. This is an excellent question that “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” poses as it compels its audience to sit with two people and their thoughts for just over 90 minutes. As a matter of fact, there’s a lot more dialogue in the film than actual sex. Not that there’s a problem with the latter, but it’s refreshing to see emotional intimacy portrayed at the same prominent level as sexual intimacy, especially amid today’s dating app culture that makes it difficult for anyone to really get to know anyone else. As any intimacy coordinator would tell you, both forms of intimacy require the same care. McCormack agrees. “I think that was the main draw for me, actually,” he said. “You have a story about a sex worker and a woman who hires him, yet there’s not major amounts of physical intimacy in the film. But we feel like it’s a very intimate film. It all begins with conversation.” “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” which McCormack describes as “very exposing and simplistic,” allows the sexual pressure to fall away from the film’s forefront in order for its two protagonists to form a type of intimacy that neither of them, nor the audience, anticipates. By mutually sharing their experiences, it gives way for sex to naturally happen between them. For her, those disclosures are personal; including how she finds her adult son “boring” and the way she faked each orgasm with her husband (moaning “Ah!” two or three times before she pretended her body was collapsing from the thrill of it all). For him, they’re more measured revelations that walk a tightrope between making her more comfortable yet preserving his professional image. Like, that he lied about his job to his mother, a strict Irish Catholic from whom he is estranged, and has a male client that likes him to dress up as a cat for an hour then go home. Aside from the confidence Nancy gains from these intimate exchanges, to the point where she brings a whole list of sexual positions to try to their second meeting, they also give her and the audience plenty to think about in terms of gender expectations and antiquated views on feminity. For instance, Leo thinks women and girls should be able to wear whatever they want and that the people who have a problem with that should mind their business. While his character is the one that utters these words, they’re also aligned with how McCormack views women. Having been raised by his mother and grandmother, or “Nan” as he refers to the latter, the actor, who like his character is Irish and Black, has a natural comfort around women that was certainly vital for this role. “Because how could you have a sex worker who’s not respecting the people that he’s working with?” he asked. “I’ve always felt safe in the presence of women, and I think that also helped in terms of working in a vulnerable context with Sophie and Emma.” It also imbues McCormack, and subsequently Leo, with “modern masculinity,” as the actor describes it, that allows the character to be confidently vulnerable and challenge Nancy on her own moral viewpoints. For him, it goes back to Nancy and Leo being two individuals in a room connecting without the constrictions of identity that could keep them listening to one another. “It’s interesting that when our gender or age doesn’t put us into a square [where] we can get wisdom, or experience, to empower one another,” McCormack said. “It’s just so interesting when we don’t fall into those binary — Well, I’m a man, so I should know this about intimacy.” He clearly feels passionately about this. “Or, I’m at this age, so I should know this about that,” he continued without even so much as a pregnant pause. “When we limit ourselves like that, it just feels like we can then only engage with people of similar things.” “What’s so interesting about these two people is that they’re very different, yet they can enlighten one another because they have different walks of life,” McCormack said. “Once they allow those differences to fall away, they realize that they can communicate with one another.” All of this underscores some of what makes “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” such a thoughtful watch. But it brings to mind a moment between Nancy and Leo, who throughout the film use aliases to protect their private identities, that raises a question of fetishization. When Nancy discovers Leo’s real name through cyberstalking and goes as far to call him by that name in person, he takes the breach in confidentiality as a direct insult. In a fit of rage, he accuses her of not actually caring about the truth of his life and looking for someone “exotic.” Though Leo adds, “I guess you found him, a whore,” “exotic” could easily refer to his race, age, the fact that he’s a sex worker or any of things that make the pair different from each other, despite the characters building the empowering connection the actor described. That’s a point McCormack also considered while developing the character. “We went back and forth about that,” he admitted. “Because I was like, ‘He feels really socially aware. It feels really out of character that he would say that.’ I think we kept that there because, for me, it felt like that showed that his trauma was just taking all sorts of things out.” As the film stirs toward its pensive ending, Leo’s painful past becomes more crystallized. But just enough to understand him on another level and not much more than that. “That’s the thing,” McCormack said. “We don’t know his past, but I’d imagine, being a person of color, it’s very hard to be exempt from ever experiencing a level of racism.” That’s fair. For the actor, the moment ultimately humanizes the character. “I think there was pain in there that had nothing to do with Nancy,” he explained. “And it’s just in this flippant, ‘Oh, that’s all you wanted.’ Because it’s his pain that’s speaking. It’s not Leo.” While watching the film, you might also notice other more subtle scenes that challenge your perception of the character, like the split second when he scans himself topless in the mirror that could be interpreted as a moment of insecurity. “I think it was important that I felt he was fallible,” McCormack concluded. “As much as he wanted to present the perfect image, and needed to in order to lay down a foundation for Nancy, it was important that we saw him struggle internally.” That’s true even within the confines of a character that is more mysterious than his counterpart. “I wanted to keep that alive on the surface,” McCormack added. “I thought it was beautiful that there is a contradiction, in the fact that he is super confident and does know who he is, but there’s something niggling at him inside that is contradicting that.” That is, after all, what makes Leo fully human. And to some extent, it’s what makes the man who plays him that more interesting to watch. “Good Luck To You, Leo Grande” streams Friday on Hulu. Senior Culture Reporter"

0,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl.

1,Martin Sheen Says He ‘Regrets’ Not Using His Real Name Professionally,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Martin Sheen may be a household name, but the actor himself wishes you knew him by his real name. Sheen — the son of a Spanish immigrant father and Irish immigrant mother — was born with the name Ramon Estévez. In an interview with Closer Weekly published Monday, the “Apocalypse Now” star said that he wishes he used his actual name when he was starting out as an actor. “That’s one of my regrets,” he told the magazine. “I never changed my name officially. It’s still Ramon Estévez on my birth certificate. It’s on my marriage license, my passport, driver’s license.” He chalked up the decision of being naive when he first started in show business. “Sometimes you get persuaded when you don’t have enough insight or even enough courage to stand up for what you believe in, and you pay for it later,” he said. “But, of course, I’m only speaking for myself.” He added that when his son, Emilio Estévez, first started acting professionally, he advised his son to stay true to his name. “The only influence I had on Emilio was to keep his name,” Sheen told Closer. “When he started out, his agent was advising him to change his name to Sheen and he wouldn’t do it. And I thank God he didn’t.” Sheen’s other famous son, Charlie Sheen, didn’t take the same advice — initially. In 2013, he was credited in Robert Rodriguez‘s film “Machete Kills” by his real name, Carlos Estévez, in the title cards. But in 2017’s “Mad Families,” Charlie Sheen was credited by his professional name. Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Elliot Page Says Life Has 'Drastically' Improved Since Coming Out As Trans,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life has only gotten better for Elliot Page since coming out as transgender. The “Umbrella Academy” star opened up about feeling a “degree of joy” he never thought possible on Tuesday’s episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” sharing that he’s learned to tune out people’s negative reactions. “It’s improved my life drastically,” Page said about transitioning. “I hope, you know, I hope maybe people who do have an issue with me can maybe try and hear that, or embrace that on some level.” “What I want to focus on right now and has been so extraordinary is the degree of joy that I feel, the degree of presence that I feel,” he added. “I feel a way that I really never thought possible for a long, long time.” While Page’s loved ones have been supportive, the actor has previously spoken about the “hatred and cruelty” he’s received since publicly disclosing that he is a transgender man in late 2020, including being verbally accosted by a stranger on the street. Page said certain “moments can be overwhelming,” but he’s choosing to concentrate on the positive, despite the spate of anti-trans bills that are rolling out across the nation. “I feel like it’s one of those things where it’s so unfortunate because it’s like, we’re all on the same team here, you know?” he told Meyers, adding that everybody faces “limits and constraints because of people’s obsession with the binary” regardless of their gender identity. The actor added, “To me, it’d be so special for us to all be able to connect and talk about how similar we are in all of our journeys.” Ultimately, Page said transitioning “made me better” both as a person and as an actor. Mirroring Page’s own real-life experience, his character on Netflix’s superhero series “Umbrella Academy,” who previously presented as female, comes out as transgender in the new season, which premiered on Wednesday. The character’s transition has drawn praise from fans and critics alike with Page explaining that showrunner Steve Blackman was “really excited about incorporating it into the show” and remarking that he feels “proud of it and excited for people to see it.” “It’s a beautiful thing to experience now,” Page said. “Because a lot of the time my life was just trying to move forward, so getting to embrace the experience as much as I get to now, I think it’s made me better in so many facets. As a person, as a friend, relationships.” Page plans to release a memoir next year about his journey. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

5,Eric Swalwell Shares Recording Of Death Threat After Marjorie Taylor Greene Attack,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) shared an audio recording of a disturbing threat Wednesday that he said he received because of false statements made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “Marjorie loves to play the victim. But she’s an inciter of violence. Her constant attacks — even after the FBI said I was never suspected of wrongdoing — lead to threatening calls like this,” he tweeted alongside the audio clip. “This caller from today threatened to kill my three children.” In the recording, a man’s voice said: “Hey, you little cocksucker. You still banging the Chinese spy Fang Fang? ... We’re coming to your house this weekend. Gon’ get you and them little mutant bastards, them little mutant offspring of yours. We’re gon’ get ya.” Earlier Wednesday, Swalwell had shared a story about an interaction with a supporter of former President Donald Trump that happened while the congressman was giving a tour of the U.S. Capitol. He said a man shouted at him and then told his son, “That’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” Today I gave a tour in the Capitol and was stopped by a father with his young boy. The father yelled at me “Hey Swalwell” and then told his son, “that’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” I kept walking and felt sad for the boy. He’s being raised in a cult family. Greene responded to the tweet by saying there was “no way that happened.” “Because we all know good Trump supporting fathers would say, “that’s the Democrat who had sex with a Chinese spy,” she tweeted. Swalwell has been targeted by right-wing disinformation over his past connection to a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Fang Fang or Christine Fang. According to a 2020 Axios report, Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians in the Bay Area and the U.S., including Swalwell. Fang reportedly took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign and recommended an intern for his office. Federal investigators said they alerted Swalwell to their concerns in 2015 and he immediately cut all ties with Fang, Axios reported. He was not accused of any wrongdoing or of passing on any classified intelligence. Fang allegedly had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors. Swalwell was not accused of having sex with her. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

(AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

8,Sen. Ron Johnson Caught Faking Phone Call To Avoid Fake Elector Questions,entertainment," National Reporter, HuffPost Facing searing questions about the revelation he tried to give false election documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) opted to fake a phone call. He got caught doing that, too. NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V spotted the Wisconsin Republican as he left the Capitol building Tuesday. Earlier that day, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol aired damning texts sent by Johnson’s chief of staff, Sean Riley, to a Pence staffer saying the senator wanted to hand the vice president an ”[a]lternate slate of electors” ― the fake election documents used to push the idea that former President Donald Trump won in states he actually lost. “How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slates of electors?” Thorp asked Johnson, as captured in a video of the encounter. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, pointing to the device and dismissively waving Thorp away. “No you’re not,” Thorp replied. “I can see your phone. I can see your screen.” Sen. Ron Johnson so much didn't want to talk to reporters about his office trying to pass fake elector lists to the vice president's office that he tried to pretend he was on the phone. pic.twitter.com/V1VwBDs42t Caught in the act, Johnson nevertheless continued the ruse, holding the phone to his ear in a one-sided, silent conversation with no one. After 30 awkward seconds, the senator put his phone down ― still having not uttered a word into it ― to tell reporters the apparent bombshell is “a complete non-story.” “I don’t know what you’re even concerned about here,” he said. Johnson denied any knowledge of what transpired between his chief of staff and Mike Pence’s staff, saying he had no idea the falsified election documents had “even been delivered to us.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) for her appreciative Father’s Day tweet this week, noting that she once criticized his husband for taking paternity leave to be with his sick newborn. “Our two-month-old son was on a ventilator at the children’s hospital when you attacked my husband for being with his family,” Chasten Buttigieg tweeted Wednesday. “I watched him take calls and Zooms from our hospital room all day, managing crisis after crisis while our son’s heart monitor beeped in the background.” Our two-month-old son was on a ventilator at the children's hospital when you attacked my husband for being with his family. I watched him take calls and Zooms from our hospital room all day, managing crisis after crisis while our son's heart monitor beeped in the background. pic.twitter.com/zRkLiAANgV In November, Boebert hurled a homophobic attack at the transportation secretary for taking time off to be with his newborn twins, saying he was unavailable to deal with the supply-chain crisis because he was “still at home trying to figure out how to chest feed.” She also boasted on another occasion that she had given birth in her truck and that “ain’t nobody got time” for parental leave. But this Father’s Day, Boebert tweeted that “the role of the father is absolutely fundamental to the family and to society as a whole.” “I want to send out a shoutout of gratitude to all of the dads across America!” she wrote. Boebert was among a chorus of right-wing criticism against Buttigieg for taking paid time off to care for his babies. Conservatives claimed he was shirking his Cabinet duties, even though Buttigieg said at the time he was still “available 24/7 on issues that can’t wait, issues that can’t be delegated and major decisions,” such as the supply-chain issue. The Buttigiegs welcomed twins Joseph August (Gus) and Penelope Rose in the summer. Chasten Buttigieg revealed in early November that “After 3 weeks in and out of hospitals, 125 miles in an ambulance, and a terrifying week on a ventilator, Gus is home, smiling, and doing great!” A post shared by Chasten Buttigieg (@chasten.buttigieg) Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Watch Lebanese Dance Troupe Unleash The Artistry of Arab Women On 'AGT',entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost The Mayyas dance troupe set out to “prove to the world what Arab women can do, the arts we can create,” one member said on Tuesday’s “America’s Got Talent.” (Watch the video below.) Mission accomplished. The Lebanese troupe amazed the panelists and audience with coordinated arm movements that generated a kaleidoscopic vibe and a creature-like illusion. The routine delivered on Mayyas’ promise to “hypnotize.” The same performer said earlier in the segment that “being a dancer as a female Arab is not fully supported yet” ― but Simon Cowell said the group’s performance will make a difference. He called them “arguably the best dance act.” Judge Sofia Vergara gave perhaps the highest compliment, pushing the Golden Buzzer to vault the team to the live rounds. The former “Modern Family” star told the group she was “so honored to empower you even more.” General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost"

Johnson was attempting to avoid questions about his role in a scheme to give then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors ahead of the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election. “I’m on the phone right now,” Johnson said, cellphone to his ear as he walked quickly. “No you’re not,” NBC News reporter Frank Thorp V replied. “I can see your phone.

12,Christian Bale Didn’t Know What The MCU Was Before 'Thor: Love And Thunder',entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Actor Christian Bale was unaware he had entered any kind of “cinematic universe” when he joined the cast of Marvel’s “Thor: Love And Thunder.” The actor — who played Gotham’s caped crusader in the “Dark Knight” trilogy — recently told Total Film he didn’t even know what the acronym “MCU” (Marvel Cinematic Universe) stood for before he ditched DC Comics for the opposing multiverse. “I’d read that, and people would go, ‘Oh, look at this! He’s entered the MCU!’ And I’d go, ‘I’ve done what? I haven’t entered shit, thank you very much,’” Bale said. “I’m like, ‘The MCU?’ I had to ask what that was.” The Oscar-winner also recounted the hilarious moment he learned about his character, Gorr the God Butcher, a sinister Marvel supervillain he didn’t even know existed. “I did make the mistake of Googling [Gorr] and, oh no! [In the comics,] he runs around in a G-string all the time,” Bale told Total Film. He added: “And I thought, ‘They don’t have the right man for that!’ And then [director Taika Waititi] quickly dispelled any notions of running around in that.” Christian Bale on researching for #Gorr:I know what he does. It's right there in the name, isn't it? But I did make the mistake of Googling him and, oh no! [In the comics] he runs around in a G-string all the time, and I thought, 'They don't have the right man for that!’ pic.twitter.com/nGs3EDWS5a Asked if he had any reservations about portraying another comic book character after playing Batman to critical acclaim, Bale rapidly banished the notion. “Absolutely not, no. That didn’t even enter into my head at all,” he said. The Method actor also shared that he and Waititi had discussed making the character less serious and that he’d wanted to add a dance sequence inspired by singer Kate Bush, who recently enjoyed a resurgence in “Stranger Things.” “There’s obviously sort of a ‘Nosferatu’ slight attitude,” Bale said. “Taika and I wanted to do a whole dance, which we didn’t get to do, but we had all this sort of Kate Bush stuff that we worked at. But I think he just realized he was never going to be allowed to put that in the final film.” “Thor: Love And Thunder,” the fourth installment of the “Thor” franchise, is set to hit theaters on July 8.

13,Tom Hanks Reveals Why He Can’t Stop Crashing His Fans’ Weddings,entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Tom Hanks shared on Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” why in recent years he’s become a serial wedding crasher at his fans’ weddings, whether he’s “invited or not.” The “Elvis” actor, who loves to hilariously photobomb his supporters on their big day, revealed why he has a passion for wedding crashing. “It’s my ego, unchecked,” Hanks said jokingly. He added: “I just can’t help but think, ‘What would these people like more than anything else to remember this magic day of days? Oh, I know, me!’” In March, Hanks stunned a bride when he united with her bridal party outside of a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh to take photos. The group was preparing to leave the venue when the longtime actor pulled up to join in on the snapshot session. The bride, Grace Gwaltney, shared that she was blown away to see the star. “He was like, ‘Hey! I’m Tom Hanks. I would love to get a photo with you,’ and I immediately froze and was just looking around,” Gwaltney told KCRA at the time. “I didn’t know what to do.” Hanks, who was declared a “man of many hats” by the show’s host, has crashed so many weddings that Meyers showcased the actor’s best wedding-crasher moments during the episode, with some clips even dating back to the early 2000s. The movie heavyweight also explained the time he took his affinity for wedding crashing internationally, after he stumbled upon a bride’s wedding while filming 2009’s “Angels and Demons” in Rome. Hanks told Meyers that the set crew wasn’t privy that a wedding party had booked the venue they were filming in, the Pantheon, on the same day. “This limousine pulled up, and it was the bride and the groom trying to ‘get me to the church on time,’” Hanks said. “And they couldn’t do it because we had all this stuff going on.” “It was like ‘Uh, how do we fix this?’ So, like a stalker — you know, ‘Hey miss, miss, miss!’ — I knocked on the window, I said ‘Hey listen, we have a thing, but would you do me the honor of escorting you to your bridal altar?’ So we did it!” the actor recalled. Hanks then joked to Meyers that the couple may not have initially recognized him at the time due to his “chemically straightened hair,” he said, pointing to his hairstyle in the throwback photo from the ceremony. “I don’t like to think I crashed a wedding. I provided a service,” the leading man added. “Elvis,” in which Hanks plays manager to the rock ‘n’ roll icon, hits theaters on Friday. Watch the trailer below. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

Pence’s office declined. This week, Johnson claimed “some staff intern” wanted an envelope delivered to the vice president and his office tried to arrange it but he didn’t know who sent it or what it was, according to The Washington Post. Colbert was incredulous: “So, he has no idea where it came from, no idea who gave it to them, no idea what it is, but he can’t wait to hand-deliver it to the second-in-command. There could’ve been anything in that envelope, he doesn’t care: fake electors, angry bees, naked pictures of Mary Todd Lincoln. It don’t matter to Ron! He’s just a delivery boy.” Colbert also said this situation answered a question he’d always had. “You know those announcements in the airport when they say, ‘Do not carry onto the flight a package for someone you don’t know’? I’ve always wondered who those announcements are for,” he said. “Turns out it’s Ron Johnson.” See his full takedown below: Overnight Editor, HuffPost"
15,Brad Pitt Gets Conned Into Hunting For Fake Buried Treasure At His French Mansion,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost In a stunning rebuke of today’s relatable celebrity culture, Brad Pitt revealed he spent a year hunting for buried medieval treasure that never existed beneath his French estate. Yes, for some reason the Oscar winner chose to come clean about getting swindled by an unnamed man who convinced him that the property he once shared with ex-wife Angelina Jolie was even more valuable than the estimated $60 million the former couple forked over for it back in 2008. Speaking with GQ in a profile published on Wednesday, Pitt said he was told that there were “millions of dollars worth of gold” left by the villa’s medieval owners that had been “taken from the Levant during the Crusades and buried on the grounds.” “I got obsessed,” said Pitt, who acquired radar equipment to hunt for the loot. “Like for a year, this was all I could think about, just the excitement of it all. Maybe it has something to do with where I grew up, because in the Ozark Mountains” near his childhood home in Missouri, “there were always stories of hidden caches of gold.” Ultimately, Pitt came up empty, and it was revealed that the man had targeted him as a potential investor in a radar company and (successfully) pitched the prospect of undiscovered riches to dupe the actor. Pitt said the ordeal left him feeling “pretty foolish in the end.” “It was just the hunt that was exciting,” he remarked. Despite the slightly embarrassing admission, there are grounds to believe buried treasure may lay beneath the historic villa. Pitt’s Château Miraval sits along an ancient Roman trade route and contains a sprawling estate and various structures, including the 13th-century chapel where he and Jolie wed. The château and its award-winning wine from the property’s vineyards have since become a major source of contention in the former couple’s ongoing divorce battle. After Jolie sold her stake in the business last year to Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, Pitt sued her in February, claiming she unlawfully disregarded their agreement never to sell their shares without the other’s permission. In a filing from Pitt’s legal team earlier this month, the actor claims Jolie “sought to inflict harm on” him by forcing him to partner with “a stranger with poisonous associations and intentions” who plans to launch a “hostile” takeover of the business. Jolie hasn’t commented on Pitt’s allegations or his hunt for fake treasure. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

1,Gloria Estefan Shades Jennifer Lopez Over Super Bowl Halftime Comments,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Gloria’s gonna get you. Gloria Estefan had no qualms about poking a little fun at actor-singer Jennifer Lopez during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” on Tuesday. During one segment, Cohen asked the Cuban American icon what she thought about the comments Lopez made about the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, in which she performed with Colombian singer Shakira. In her Netflix documentary “Halftime,” Lopez complained about the time constraints of having to share the stage, calling it “the worst idea in the world.” In response, Estefan told Cohen that she was asked to join Lopez and Shakira on the Super Bowl stage but rejected the offer. “Look, this is the bottom line. You have very little time, like 12 minutes or something, to get things on and off the set,” Estefan explained. “So, could you do it with one person? Yes, but I think they wanted to throw a Miami and Latin extravaganza, and they tried to pack it as much as possible.” And although Estefan said that the women “killed it” and that it was an “amazing show,” the “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” singer also took the opportunity to throw a little shade at Lopez. “OK, and imagine what J.Lo would have said if I was the third [performer]!” Estefan said, bugging out her eyes. “I literally would come out, done ‘come on shake your body,’ out!” Estefan joked, referring to the lyrics of her 1985 Miami Sound Machine hit, “Conga!” Estefan then added that she’s performed at a few Super Bowls and that Lopez and Shakira’s show was “their moment” to shine. “Plus, I didn’t want to go on a diet in December,” Estefan said. “It’s Christmas!” Lopez’s complaints about her Super Bowl performance in “Halftime” weren’t directed at Shakira but at the NFL. Lopez’s manager Benny Medina shared his client’s frustrations over the NFL’s choice of a co-headlining performance. “Typically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that’s their choice,” he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.” Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Trevor Noah Has A Blunt Observation About What Really Matters To Americans,entertainment,"  Trevor Noah believes protecting one piece of paper matters more to Americans than the lives of other people. On Wednesday, “The Daily Show” host discussed the Senate’s advancement of the bipartisan gun safety bill this week. The bill looks to improve background checks for people between 18 and 21 years old, give incentives to states that pass “red flag” legislation and close the “boyfriend loophole” which bars partners from buying guns if they’ve been convicted of domestic violence. The legislation advanced in the Senate after mass shootings killed supermarket shoppers in Buffalo, New York and students in Uvalde, Texas in May. But that didn’t stop Noah from mocking Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for claiming the bill was “fully upholding the Second Amendment.” “Oh, I agree with Sen. Mitch McConnell. Thank God the precious Second Amendment has been preserved. Oh yes, I mean I’m all for protecting kids but the Second Amendment. Oh, have you seen that little face? Have you seen it? Whose Second Amendment are you?Whose Second Amendment are you? You’re so adorable,” Noah joked. “Sometimes I feel like Americans want to protect the Constitution more than they want to protect the Americans the Constitution is supposed to protect.” Watch Noah’s full discussion on the bill below: "

4,Eric Swalwell Shares Recording Of Death Threat After Marjorie Taylor Greene Attack,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) shared an audio recording of a disturbing threat Wednesday that he said he received because of false statements made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “Marjorie loves to play the victim. But she’s an inciter of violence. Her constant attacks — even after the FBI said I was never suspected of wrongdoing — lead to threatening calls like this,” he tweeted alongside the audio clip. “This caller from today threatened to kill my three children.” In the recording, a man’s voice said: “Hey, you little cocksucker. You still banging the Chinese spy Fang Fang? ... We’re coming to your house this weekend. Gon’ get you and them little mutant bastards, them little mutant offspring of yours. We’re gon’ get ya.” Earlier Wednesday, Swalwell had shared a story about an interaction with a supporter of former President Donald Trump that happened while the congressman was giving a tour of the U.S. Capitol. He said a man shouted at him and then told his son, “That’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” Today I gave a tour in the Capitol and was stopped by a father with his young boy. The father yelled at me “Hey Swalwell” and then told his son, “that’s Swalwell. He’s trouble. He doesn’t back Trump.” I kept walking and felt sad for the boy. He’s being raised in a cult family. Greene responded to the tweet by saying there was “no way that happened.” “Because we all know good Trump supporting fathers would say, “that’s the Democrat who had sex with a Chinese spy,” she tweeted. Swalwell has been targeted by right-wing disinformation over his past connection to a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Fang Fang or Christine Fang. According to a 2020 Axios report, Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians in the Bay Area and the U.S., including Swalwell. Fang reportedly took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign and recommended an intern for his office. Federal investigators said they alerted Swalwell to their concerns in 2015 and he immediately cut all ties with Fang, Axios reported. He was not accused of any wrongdoing or of passing on any classified intelligence. Fang allegedly had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors. Swalwell was not accused of having sex with her. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Tells Reporter To ‘Go Back To Your Country’,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) boasted Wednesday that she told a reporter to “go back to your country” after being asked about the disparity in gun violence between the U.S. and the U.K. “We don’t have guns in the U.K., that is true, but we don’t have mass shootings either,” a woman, whose identity was unclear, asked Greene at a press conference, according to a clip the congresswoman posted to Twitter. “Children aren’t scared to go to school.” Greene, flanked by other pro-gun House Republicans, including Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.) Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Andrew Clyde (Ga.), replied: “You have mass stabbings, lady. You have all kinds of murder and you’ve got laws against that.” “Nothing like the same rates here,” the reporter replied. “Well, you can go back to your country and worry about your no guns. We like ours here,” Greene said. When British press wants to argue about our God-given American gun rights, my answer is: “go back to your own country.” pic.twitter.com/QrcA9Apbet The U.S. homicide rate is four times higher than the U.K. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 80% of U.S. murders in 2020 involved a firearm. Globally, firearms accounted for 54% of all homicides in 2017 while knives accounted for 22%, per a United Nations Global Study on Homicide. The gun death rate in the U.S. is substantially higher than any other developed nation, most of which have stricter gun control laws. In the past few years, England, Scotland and Wales combined have seen around 30 gun deaths a year. Comparatively, the number of murders involving firearms in the U.S. in 2020 was 19,384. Greene and many of her House GOP colleagues have criticized a bipartisan gun bill which on Tuesday cleared an initial hurdle to passing in the Senate, breaking a decades-long stalemate on gun control legislation. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act would expand background checks and direct millions of dollars toward helping states enact red-flag laws, which allow authorities to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others. A group of 14 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. John Cornyn (Texas), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), voted to proceed with the bill. Greene listed the names of these senators during her press conference, declaring them the elected Republicans that “Republican voters do not support anymore.” “We’ve gotta change our Republican Party,” she said. However, polling has repeatedly shown that a majority of voters, including Republicans and gun owners, support background checks and red flag laws.

6,Arkansas’ Israel Boycott Pledge Law Upheld By Appeals Court,entertainment," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Arkansas’ law requiring state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel, finding the restriction is not an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The full 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a 2-1 decision last year by a three-judge panel of the court that found the requirement to be unconstitutional. The Arkansas Times had sued to block the law, which requires contractors with the state to reduce their fees by 20% if they don’t sign the pledge. “(The law) only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” Judge Jonathan Kobes wrote in the court’s opinion. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” A federal judge in 2019 dismissed the Times’ lawsuit, ruling that the boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment. A three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed that ruling, and the state appealed to the full appeals court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Times, said it planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nation’s historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts,” Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Foundation’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a statement. The new ruling didn’t give a breakdown of how judges decided, but at least one dissented, saying the law is written so broadly that it could go beyond boycotts. “One could imagine a company posting anti-Israel signs, donating to causes that promote a boycott of Israel, encouraging others to boycott Israel, or even publicly criticizing the act with the intent to ‘limit commercial relations with Israel’ as a general matter,” Judge Jane Kelly wrote in her dissent. “And any of that conduct would arguably fall within the prohibition.” The Times’ lawsuit said the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College refused to contract for advertising with the newspaper unless the paper signed the pledge. The newspaper isn’t engaged in a boycott against Israel. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansas’s anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansas’s relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office defended the law, said in a statement. Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials say the campaign masks a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying the country. Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas that were blocked were later allowed to be enforced after lawmakers narrowed the requirement so it applied only to larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more. Citing its anti-boycott law, Arizona last year sold off millions of dollars in Unilever bonds over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories.

7,Chasten Buttigieg Slams Lauren Boebert After She Sends 'Gratitude' To 'All' Dads,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, blasted Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) for her appreciative Father’s Day tweet this week, noting that she once criticized his husband for taking paternity leave to be with his sick newborn. “Our two-month-old son was on a ventilator at the children’s hospital when you attacked my husband for being with his family,” Chasten Buttigieg tweeted Wednesday. “I watched him take calls and Zooms from our hospital room all day, managing crisis after crisis while our son’s heart monitor beeped in the background.” Our two-month-old son was on a ventilator at the children's hospital when you attacked my husband for being with his family. I watched him take calls and Zooms from our hospital room all day, managing crisis after crisis while our son's heart monitor beeped in the background. pic.twitter.com/zRkLiAANgV In November, Boebert hurled a homophobic attack at the transportation secretary for taking time off to be with his newborn twins, saying he was unavailable to deal with the supply-chain crisis because he was “still at home trying to figure out how to chest feed.” She also boasted on another occasion that she had given birth in her truck and that “ain’t nobody got time” for parental leave. But this Father’s Day, Boebert tweeted that “the role of the father is absolutely fundamental to the family and to society as a whole.” “I want to send out a shoutout of gratitude to all of the dads across America!” she wrote. Boebert was among a chorus of right-wing criticism against Buttigieg for taking paid time off to care for his babies. Conservatives claimed he was shirking his Cabinet duties, even though Buttigieg said at the time he was still “available 24/7 on issues that can’t wait, issues that can’t be delegated and major decisions,” such as the supply-chain issue. The Buttigiegs welcomed twins Joseph August (Gus) and Penelope Rose in the summer. Chasten Buttigieg revealed in early November that “After 3 weeks in and out of hospitals, 125 miles in an ambulance, and a terrifying week on a ventilator, Gus is home, smiling, and doing great!” A post shared by Chasten Buttigieg (@chasten.buttigieg) Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Herschel Walker Says There Are 52 States,entertainment," Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost There are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.” Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.” In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose. “If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?” “Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost. Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.” Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March. After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states. “It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.” He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries.

9,Elizabeth Warren Sends Urgent Warning To Fed Chair Over Interest Rate Hikes,entertainment,"  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that he should be careful not to “tip the economy into a recession” with interest rate hikes. Warren, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Wednesday, discussed how the rate hikes to help deal with rising U.S. costs could carry the economy off a “cliff,” CNN reported. The Federal Reserve last week increased its key interest rate by three-quarters of a point, its largest hike since 1994. The move, meant to counteract inflation by making it more costly to borrow money, raised concerns of a potential slowdown in economic activity. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said she thinks economic activity will slow. However, she said she doesn’t think a recession is “inevitable.” Warren told Powell, “Inflation is like an illness, and the medicine needs to be tailored to the specific problem, otherwise you could make things a lot worse.” “Right now, the Fed has no control over the main drivers of rising prices, but the Fed can slow demand by getting a lot of people fired and making families poorer.” Warren asked what was worse than high inflation and low unemployment and then gave Powell an answer: High inflation with a recession and millions without jobs. “I hope you consider that before you drive this economy off a cliff,” she said. You can watch a clip of Warren’s address to Powell below. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to proceed with rate hikes cautiously and avoid setting off a recession that costs millions of jobs. https://t.co/iGEqsbHfuq pic.twitter.com/xQKPOjcpr3 Powell said that the Federal Reserve was “not trying to provoke” a recession and doesn’t think it will need to provoke one. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal predicted the likelihood of a recession in the next year is 44%, compared with 28% in April. The newspaper called the percentage a “level usually seen only on the brink of or during actual recessions.” "
10,Martin Sheen Says He ‘Regrets’ Not Using His Real Name Professionally,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Martin Sheen may be a household name, but the actor himself wishes you knew him by his real name. Sheen — the son of a Spanish immigrant father and Irish immigrant mother — was born with the name Ramon Estévez. In an interview with Closer Weekly published Monday, the “Apocalypse Now” star said that he wishes he used his actual name when he was starting out as an actor. “That’s one of my regrets,” he told the magazine. “I never changed my name officially. It’s still Ramon Estévez on my birth certificate. It’s on my marriage license, my passport, driver’s license.” He chalked up the decision of being naive when he first started in show business. “Sometimes you get persuaded when you don’t have enough insight or even enough courage to stand up for what you believe in, and you pay for it later,” he said. “But, of course, I’m only speaking for myself.” He added that when his son, Emilio Estévez, first started acting professionally, he advised his son to stay true to his name. “The only influence I had on Emilio was to keep his name,” Sheen told Closer. “When he started out, his agent was advising him to change his name to Sheen and he wouldn’t do it. And I thank God he didn’t.” Sheen’s other famous son, Charlie Sheen, didn’t take the same advice — initially. In 2013, he was credited in Robert Rodriguez‘s film “Machete Kills” by his real name, Carlos Estévez, in the title cards. But in 2017’s “Mad Families,” Charlie Sheen was credited by his professional name. Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Bill Nye The Science Guy Is Now A Married Man,entertainment," Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer. Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Seth Meyers Roasts The 'Bad Scam Artists' On Trump's Legal Team,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Seth Meyers was blown away by how close a bunch of “bad scam artists” came to overthrowing the nation’s democracy. On “Late Night” Wednesday, Meyers reviewed footage of the fourth Jan. 6 committee hearing from earlier this week. The House panel investigating the U.S. Capitol attack interviewed Rusty Bowers, an Arizona GOP official who said that after the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s legal adviser Jenna Ellis told him that they had proof of electoral fraud but she didn’t have it on her. “This is just me, but if I was preparing for a high stakes meeting with a prominent Republican official to convince them to overturn their state’s election results, reversing the will of 80 million people and potentially provoking a constitutional crisis, I think I’d remember to bring the evidence. But that’s just me,” Meyers joked. “They actually thought they could get away with saying they had the proof, just never having it with them. These people are such bad scam artists. It’s actually remarkable how close they came to overthrowing American democracy,” he added. Watch the rest of the roast below on “Late Night”: Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Elliot Page Says Life Has 'Drastically' Improved Since Coming Out As Trans,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life has only gotten better for Elliot Page since coming out as transgender. The “Umbrella Academy” star opened up about feeling a “degree of joy” he never thought possible on Tuesday’s episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” sharing that he’s learned to tune out people’s negative reactions. “It’s improved my life drastically,” Page said about transitioning. “I hope, you know, I hope maybe people who do have an issue with me can maybe try and hear that, or embrace that on some level.” “What I want to focus on right now and has been so extraordinary is the degree of joy that I feel, the degree of presence that I feel,” he added. “I feel a way that I really never thought possible for a long, long time.” While Page’s loved ones have been supportive, the actor has previously spoken about the “hatred and cruelty” he’s received since publicly disclosing that he is a transgender man in late 2020, including being verbally accosted by a stranger on the street. Page said certain “moments can be overwhelming,” but he’s choosing to concentrate on the positive, despite the spate of anti-trans bills that are rolling out across the nation. “I feel like it’s one of those things where it’s so unfortunate because it’s like, we’re all on the same team here, you know?” he told Meyers, adding that everybody faces “limits and constraints because of people’s obsession with the binary” regardless of their gender identity. The actor added, “To me, it’d be so special for us to all be able to connect and talk about how similar we are in all of our journeys.” Ultimately, Page said transitioning “made me better” both as a person and as an actor. Mirroring Page’s own real-life experience, his character on Netflix’s superhero series “Umbrella Academy,” who previously presented as female, comes out as transgender in the new season, which premiered on Wednesday. The character’s transition has drawn praise from fans and critics alike with Page explaining that showrunner Steve Blackman was “really excited about incorporating it into the show” and remarking that he feels “proud of it and excited for people to see it.” “It’s a beautiful thing to experience now,” Page said. “Because a lot of the time my life was just trying to move forward, so getting to embrace the experience as much as I get to now, I think it’s made me better in so many facets. As a person, as a friend, relationships.” Page plans to release a memoir next year about his journey. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Christian Bale Didn’t Know What The MCU Was Before 'Thor: Love And Thunder',entertainment," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Actor Christian Bale was unaware he had entered any kind of “cinematic universe” when he joined the cast of Marvel’s “Thor: Love And Thunder.” The actor — who played Gotham’s caped crusader in the “Dark Knight” trilogy — recently told Total Film he didn’t even know what the acronym “MCU” (Marvel Cinematic Universe) stood for before he ditched DC Comics for the opposing multiverse. “I’d read that, and people would go, ‘Oh, look at this! He’s entered the MCU!’ And I’d go, ‘I’ve done what? I haven’t entered shit, thank you very much,’” Bale said. “I’m like, ‘The MCU?’ I had to ask what that was.” The Oscar-winner also recounted the hilarious moment he learned about his character, Gorr the God Butcher, a sinister Marvel supervillain he didn’t even know existed. “I did make the mistake of Googling [Gorr] and, oh no! [In the comics,] he runs around in a G-string all the time,” Bale told Total Film. He added: “And I thought, ‘They don’t have the right man for that!’ And then [director Taika Waititi] quickly dispelled any notions of running around in that.” Christian Bale on researching for #Gorr:I know what he does. It's right there in the name, isn't it? But I did make the mistake of Googling him and, oh no! [In the comics] he runs around in a G-string all the time, and I thought, 'They don't have the right man for that!’ pic.twitter.com/nGs3EDWS5a Asked if he had any reservations about portraying another comic book character after playing Batman to critical acclaim, Bale rapidly banished the notion. “Absolutely not, no. That didn’t even enter into my head at all,” he said. The Method actor also shared that he and Waititi had discussed making the character less serious and that he’d wanted to add a dance sequence inspired by singer Kate Bush, who recently enjoyed a resurgence in “Stranger Things.” “There’s obviously sort of a ‘Nosferatu’ slight attitude,” Bale said. “Taika and I wanted to do a whole dance, which we didn’t get to do, but we had all this sort of Kate Bush stuff that we worked at. But I think he just realized he was never going to be allowed to put that in the final film.” “Thor: Love And Thunder,” the fourth installment of the “Thor” franchise, is set to hit theaters on July 8.

Timberlake, the former ’N Sync star known for hits like “SexyBack,” got grilled online for an attempt at the “Beat Ya Feet” dance during his appearance at Pharrell’s “Something in the Water” festival in Washington, D.C., on Sunday. The dance Timberlake attempted, according to DCist, is a “series of three-step moves and a bounce” that comes from the D.C. area and its funky go-go music scene. After Timberlake attempted the dance, however, Twitter users were not having it while others were quick to question his swag for wearing “Old Navy” khakis. D.C.
