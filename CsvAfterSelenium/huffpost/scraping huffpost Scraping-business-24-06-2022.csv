0,"U.S. Pools Close, Go Without Lifeguards Amid Labor Shortage",business," INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Manager Ashley Ford strode the perimeter of one of Indianapolis’ five open swimming pools, monitoring kids as they jumped off a diving board or careened into the water from a curved slide. Four lifeguards, whistles at the ready, watched from their tall chairs stationed around the water. With a dozen of the city’s pools shuttered due to a lifeguard shortage, families sometimes line up more than an hour before the one at Frederick Douglass Park opens, Ford said. Many days, it reaches capacity. A national lifeguard shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted communities such as Indianapolis to cut back on pools and hours. In other spots around the United States, swimming areas go without attendants. That’s left some Americans with fewer or riskier options, even as a significant part of the nation endures a second heat wave in as many weeks. Public health experts say the risk of drowning decreases significantly when lifeguards are present. “That’s my biggest thing, is making everybody safe,” Ford said. The American Lifeguard Association estimates the shortage impacts one-third of U.S. pools. Bernard J. Fisher II, director of health and safety at the association, expects that to grow to half of all pools by August, when many teenage lifeguards return to school. “It is a disaster,” Fisher said. Summer shortages aren’t unusual, but U.S. pools are also dealing with the fallout from earlier in the pandemic, when they closed and lifeguard certification stopped, Fisher said. Starting pay lags behind many other jobs, though some cities are ramping up incentives. Indy Parks and Recreation has 100 lifeguards on staff this year when normally it would have double that, said Ford, who was worked for the agency for 20 years. Even as lifeguards from closed neighboring pools bulk up the open facilities, pools in Indianapolis must still close for an hourlong lunch and cleaning break each day. When a local pool is not open, young people may go swimming in places without lifeguards, Fisher said. That can result in more drownings, which disproportionately affect people of color. In the U.S., Black people under 29 are 1.5 times more likely to drown compared with white Americans of the same age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 330,000 people enroll the American Red Cross’ lifeguarding course annually. That figure shrank, as many pools shuttered due to the pandemic, but is now rising, Jenelle Eli, senior director of media relations for the American Red Cross said in a statement to The Associated Press. Indy Parks requires its lifeguards to pass a course in which they swim 100 yards, tread water for a minute without using their hands and retrieve a 10-pound object from the bottom of a pool. Starting pay is $15 per hour, up from $13 an hour earlier this year. Those who stay through the season will receive a $100 retention bonus, Boyd said. “I’ve tried to get some of my friends that want to get a summer job and want to have money in their pockets,” said second-year lifeguard Donald Harris, 17. “They’ve just said lifeguarding isn’t for them.” At Indiana’s state parks, lifeguards are paid $11 an hour. All of the state’s 37 facilities remain open, but some operate on limited hours, said Terry Coleman, director of the Division of Indiana State Parks. Many Indiana state parks additionally have shallow swimming areas without lifeguards, Coleman said. “We’re looking at potential incentives for maybe the 2023 recreation season, but nothing in stone yet,” he said. In Maine, several state parks started the season without lifeguards, and visitors are informed at the park entrance when no lifeguard is on duty, said Jim Britt, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The state pays lifeguards about $16 an hour. “It’s a concern,” Britt said. “There’s no two ways about it. We want lifeguards to be there and to be on duty.” Chicago, which boasts one of the nation’s largest aquatic programs — 77 public pools and 22 beaches that serve a population of nearly 2.75 million — pushed opening day for pools back to July 5 from June 24. “Chicago families rely on our park programs during the summer, so we are not giving up,” Chicago Park District Superintendent Rosa Escareño said in a news release. Escareño attributed the scarcity in part to “mass resignation” — referring to post-pandemic labor shortages. Chicago Park District pays $15.88 hourly and is now offering bonuses of $600, up from $500 in May, to new hires who stay through the summer. It also relaxed residency requirements, meaning applicants do not have to live in the city. One cause for applicant hesitation unrelated to the pandemic may be a lifeguard sexual abuse scandal that rocked Chicago Park District last year. Escareño said the organization has since strengthened its accountability and reporting systems. “I think right now, the most important thing is to ensure that we open safely, and that we place the greatest priority on safety, not just the safety of our residents, but also the safety of our employees,” she said. ___ Associated Press reporter David Sharp in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.

1,Maryland Apple Workers Face Hurdles After Vote To Unionize,business," TOWSON, Md. (AP) — The historic vote by employees of a Maryland Apple store to unionize — a first for the technology giant — is a significant step in a lengthy process that labor experts say is heavily stacked against workers in favor of their employers. Apple store employees in a Baltimore suburb voted to unionize by a nearly 2-to-1 margin Saturday, joining a growing push across U.S. retail, service and tech industries to organize for greater workplace protections. It’s not yet clear whether the recent wave of unionizations represent a broader shift in U.S. labor. But experts say the current shortage of workers for hourly and low-wage jobs means employees have more power than they had historically, especially when unemployment is low. “It’s not that big a deal to lose one of these jobs because you can get another crummy job,” said Ruth Milkman, labor scholar at the City University of New York. The question is, what happens now? The Apple retail workers in Towson, Maryland, voted 65-33 to seek entry into the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union’s announcement said. The National Labor Relations Board now has to certify the outcome. A spokesperson referred initial queries about the vote to the board’s regional office, which was closed late Saturday. The board did not immediately respond to an Associated Press message on Sunday. Once the vote is certified, the union and Apple can begin negotiating a contract. “Labor law in the United States is a long process. And so the fact that a single store negotiates or elects a union doesn’t mean that there’s a negotiated contract in the workplace. And we know in recent history that in many of these situations, parties are unable to come to terms on an initial contract,” Michael Duff, a former NLRB lawyer and professor at University of Wyoming College of Law, said Sunday. “The employer in the United States has an awful lot of rights to simply withdraw recognition at the end of the process. The employer can prove that it no longer supports a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit,” Duff added. Even after a union is certified, a company has a number of legal maneuvers at its disposal to fight it, Duff said. For instance, Apple could say it doesn’t believe that the bargaining unit certified by the NLRB is an appropriate bargaining unit. and refuse to bargain with the union. “If that happens, the whole thing goes to the courts and it could easily be a year or two before you even get the question of whether the employer is required to bargain with the union,” Duff added. Labor experts say it’s common for employers to drag out the bargaining process in an effort to take the momentum out of union campaigns. It’s also possible that Apple — or any other company — restructures its business so the unionized workers are reclassified as independent contractors and not employees, in which case the union vote is moot, Duff said. Apple declined to comment on Saturday’s development, company spokesperson Josh Lipton told The Associated Press by phone. Reached again Sunday, Apple did not comment. The successful vote serves to inspire workers around the country to organize, said John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University. “Workers are already organizing at other Apple stores, but this shows them the company is not invincible,” he said. Apple’s well-known brand name is also likely to help. “The public has a very direct relationship with companies like Apple, so the first union victory will generate enormous traditional media and social media coverage,” Logan said. “Young workers learn union activism through this coverage, and some will likely be inspired to try to organize their own workplaces.” Despite U.S. labor law being stacked against workers, Duff said he thinks that “if there is going to be a reawakened labor movement in the United States it will happen in just this way.” Union organizing in a variety of fields has gained momentum recently after decades of decline in U.S. union membership. Organizers have worked to establish unions at companies including Amazon, Starbucks, Google parent company Alphabet and outdoors retailer REI. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the Apple employees who wanted to join said they sent Apple CEO Tim Cook notice last month that they were seeking to form a union. The statement said their driving motivation was to seek “rights we do not currently have.” It added that the workers recently organized in the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees, or CORE. “I applaud the courage displayed by CORE members at the Apple store in Towson for achieving this historic victory,” IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. said in the statement. “They made a huge sacrifice for thousands of Apple employees across the nation who had all eyes on this election.” Martinez called on Apple to respect the election results and to let the unionizing employees fast-track efforts to secure a contract at the Towson location. The IAM bills itself as one of the largest and most diverse industrial trade unions in North America, representing approximately 600,000 active and retired members in the aerospace, defense, airlines, railroad, transit, healthcare, automotive, and other industries. Logan said the Apple victory shows that the established labor movement “is capable of adapting its self to the needs of the group of independent-minded, self-confident workers you find at Apple stores.” The Apple store unionization vote comes against a backdrop of other labor organizing efforts nationwide — some of them rebuffed. Amazon workers at a warehouse in New York City voted to unionize in April, the first successful U.S. organizing effort in the retail giant’s history. However, workers at another Amazon warehouse on Staten Island overwhelmingly rejected a union bid last month. Meanwhile, Starbucks workers at dozens of U.S. stores have voted to unionize in recent months, after two of the coffee chain’s stores in Buffalo, New York, voted to unionize late last year. Many unionization efforts have been led by young workers in their 20s and even in their teens. A group of Google engineers and other workers formed the Alphabet Workers Union last year, which represents around 800 Google employees and is run by five people who are under 35. “This is the generation with the kind of world view that’s really different than we’ve seen in many generations,” said CUNY’s Milkman. “They believe in this.”"
2,Apple Store Workers In Maryland Become First To Unionize,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Workers at an Apple store outside Baltimore have formed the tech giant’s first retail union in the U.S., marking another high-profile victory for the labor movement this year. Employees at the company’s Towson Center store voted 65 to 33 in favor of joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, according to a vote count conducted Saturday by the National Labor Relations Board. Board officials have not certified the results yet to make them official. The union’s success at Apple shows the worker organizing wave that recently hit Starbucks, Amazon and REI may continue to spread to other big-name employers. Many workers who have felt mistreated during the pandemic are seeking out union representation amid the unusually tight labor market, with the labor board seeing a noticeable uptick in election petitions this year compared to 2021. The president of the machinists union, Robert Martinez Jr., immediately called upon Apple to start negotiating a contract, and praised the Apple workers for what he called a ""historic victory."" 'They made a huge sacrifice for thousands of Apple employees across the nation who had all eyes on this election,"" he said. The workers in Towson had been organizing with the machinists union under the name Apple Coalition of Organized Retail Employees, or AppleCORE. They sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook last month saying they had “come together as a union because of a deep love of our role as workers within the company and out of care for the company itself.” They alluded to other workers at “large companies in the service and tech sectors” that have chosen to unionize, saying they were proud to follow in those workers’ footsteps. More than 100 Starbucks stores have unionized since late last year, and the first Amazon union in the U.S. was established in New York City in April. “The union’s success at Apple shows the worker organizing wave that recently hit Starbucks, Amazon and REI may continue to spread to other big-name employers.” Those companies have strongly opposed their workers’ desire to form a union, and Apple appears to be taking a similar position, likely concerned that a successful union bid will quickly spread to other stores around the country like it has at Starbucks. Store managers have urged workers not to unionize in meetings with staff, and the company has hired the same union-avoidance law firm as Starbucks, Littler Mendelson, to combat the effort. Meanwhile, a company executive released a video to tens of thousands of workers to meant to discourage unionization, The Verge reported . “I worry about what it would mean to put another organization in the middle of our relationship,” said the executive, Deirdre O’Brien. Other Apple retail workers have recently launched organizing campaigns as well. The Communications Workers of America union filed a petition to hold an election for an Apple store in an Atlanta mall but withdrew it weeks later, something unions sometimes do when they believe they’ve lost the necessary support. CWA is also organizing workers at Apple’s Grand Central store in New York City, where workers are seeking to hold a vote of their own. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
3,"Elon Musk Offers Thoughts On Finances, Space Aliens In First Meeting With Twitter Staff",business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk held a meeting with Twitter employees Thursday detailing his vision for the social media platform, despite his threat to walk away from his takeover deal if the company doesn’t share data on spam bot accounts. This all-hands meeting was the first time the billionaire took questions from employees since Twitter’s board announced it would sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April. The call was closed to reporters, but several key moments were leaked to news outlets. Asked whether he is considering layoffs, the world’s richest person did not directly answer. “The company does need to get healthy,” Musk said, people who attended the meeting told Bloomberg. “Right now the costs exceed the revenue, so that’s not a great situation to be in.” “Obviously a significant contributor should have nothing to worry about,” Musk continued. In May, Twitter announced a hiring freeze, except for business-critical roles, and fired two executives. Musk also talked about product changes he would consider, including some that could boost revenue. He said users could be authenticated through Twitter Blue, the company’s paid subscription offering, currently rolled out in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. He also discussed spam bot accounts on Twitter, a sticking point for the completion of the deal, and how the company should crack down. “It needs to be much more expensive to have a troll army,” Musk said, according to The Verge. Agrawal said on Twitter that spam accounts represent less than 5% of monetizable daily active users. The analysis didn’t seem to satisfy Musk, who tweeted a poop emoji in response. Musk, who demanded Tesla and SpaceX staff return to the office for a minimum of 40 hours per week, said he could accept Twitter employees working from home if they are “exceptional.” In May 2020, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told employees they could work remotely forever if they choose to do so. “The bias definitely needs to be strongly towards working in person, but if somebody is exceptional, then remote work can be OK,” Musk was quoted as saying in Bloomberg. “If someone is excellent at what they do but can only work remotely, to then fire them even though they are doing excellent work would be insane,” Musk continued. “So I’m definitely not in favor of things that are, like, mad. I’m in favor of things that build the business and make it better.” Musk, who was introduced by Agrawal for Thursday’s meeting, reportedly joined the call 10 minutes late from what appeared to be his smartphone, according to The Verge deputy editor Alex Heath. Elon Musk showed up 10 minutes late to his first meeting addressing Twitter employees, which is still ongoing. He dialed in from his phone handheld like this pic.twitter.com/UoZ4U9dDme Musk, asked to define Twitter success within the next five to 10 years, told staff he would like to see daily active users top 1 billion, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal. Twitter currently reaches approximately 229 million monetizable daily active users worldwide. Musk also told employees he would want Twitter to learn from Chinese apps WeChat, used from everything from instant messaging to e-commerce, and TikTok, praising its algorithm for being interesting, according to The Verge. “There’s no WeChat equivalent outside of China,” Musk said. “You basically live on WeChat in China. If we can recreate that with Twitter, we’ll be a great success.” During the call, Musk roamed beyond day-to-day operations, saying he hasn’t seen “actual evidence of aliens.” “Can we travel to other star systems and see if there are alien civilizations?” Musk asked, according to the BBC. Twitter could help “civilization and consciousness,” Musk added. When the 45-minute call ended, Musk turned off his camera. An avatar of two hands shaping the number 69 appeared, interpreted as a reference to the sex position, a source told Reuters. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

Others pointed out that innocent people rarely request pardons. Wow. Congressmen helping Trump on & before 1/6 & then demanding pardons. Makes me think of 18 USC 201: A public official who corruptly seeks anything of value in return for an official act or colluding in fraud shall be imprisoned for up to 15 years & disqualified from office Hi Matt.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,UPS Test Drives Tiny Battery-Powered Cycles For Deliveries In Congested Cities,business," NEW YORK (AP) — The sleek four-wheeled carts look familiar enough, but not even UPS knows precisely how to describe what could be the delivery giant’s latest way to get packages to your door. UPS unveiled Tuesday a battery-powered, four-wheeled cycle to more efficiently haul cargo in some of the world’s most congested streets and to reduce its carbon footprint. The company is trying to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The slimmed-down vehicles don the company’s gold-colored logo and accompanying stripe on a dark brown background. But the “eQuad” — as the company calls it — garnered amusement from passersby. Ian Lagowitz had never seen one and walked over to give it a look. “It’s funny looking,” he said, “but it’s probably good for the city, right?” Mohammad Islam called the vehicle “cool stuff,” and wished the program well. “Big trucks always blocking the traffic,” he said, “so if they do that kind of stuff, it’s 10 times better for everybody.” The pedal-powered vehicle was dwarfed by one of the company’s more traditional delivery trucks, which rumble through traffic and sometimes draw the ire of motorists trying to get by parked trucks on narrow streets. Delivery companies have tried all sorts of ways to deliver packages — from traditional vans to drones. The company now has a fleet of more than 1,000 electric vehicles and thousands more that aren’t powered by traditional gas engines. UPS said a trial run is focused on New York City and in several cities in Europe. “New York is a complicated city, when we look at the density,” said Nicole Pilet, the industrial engineering director for UPS. “So if we can have success here in the city, then we can see how we implement in other cities throughout the U.S.” The company had its start in Seattle more than a century ago and the first deliveries were made by foot or bicycle. As the company grew, its motorized fleet did, too. “This is right in my wheelhouse,” said Dyghton Anderson, a 22-year-old UPS delivery person and an avid cyclist who is helping pilot the program. “I ride to and from work — from all the way from the Bronx all the way to here on 43rd — so it’s pretty comfortable for me.” ___ Associated Press writer Bobby Caina Calvan contributed to this story."
11,Data Likely Shows Teslas On Autopilot Crash More Than Rivals,business," DETROIT (AP) — The government will soon release data on collisions involving vehicles with autonomous or partially automated driving systems that will likely single out Tesla for a disproportionately high number of such crashes. In coming days, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to issue figures it has been gathering for nearly a year. The agency said in a separate report last week that it had documented more than 200 crashes involving Teslas that were using Autopilot, “Full Self-Driving,” Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or some other of the company’s partially automated systems. Tesla’s figure and its crash rate per 1,000 vehicles was substantially higher than the corresponding numbers for other automakers that provided such data to The Associated Press ahead of NHTSA’s release. The number of Tesla collisions was revealed as part of a NHTSA investigation of Teslas on Autopilot that had crashed into emergency and other vehicles stopped along roadways. Tesla does have many more vehicles with partly automated systems operating on U.S. roads than most other automakers do — roughly 830,000, dating to the 2014 model year. And it collects real-time data online from vehicles, so it has a much faster reporting system. Other automakers, by contrast, must wait for reports to arrive from the field and sometimes don’t learn about crashes for months. In a June 2021 order, NHTSA told more than 100 automakers and automated vehicle tech companies to report serious crashes within one day of learning about them and to disclose less-serious crashes by the 15th day of the following month. The agency is assessing how the systems perform, whether they endanger public safety and whether new regulations may be needed. General Motors said it reported three crashes while its “Super Cruise” or other partially automated systems were in use. The company said it has sold more than 34,000 vehicles with Super Cruise since its debut in 2017. Nissan, with over 560,000 vehicles on the road using its ”ProPilot Assist,” didn’t have to report any crashes, the company said. Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, said it reported two crashes involving its systems. Ford reported zero involving its “Blue Cruise” driver-assist system which went on sale in the spring, though Ford wouldn’t say if there were crashes with less-capable systems. GM said the three crashes weren’t the fault of Super Cruise. It also reported two crashes that happened before the June 2021 order, a spokesman said. Several automakers and tech companies, including Toyota and Honda, declined to release their numbers before the NHTSA data is revealed. A message was left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. NHTSA wouldn’t comment on the data Tuesday. Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies automated vehicles, said he wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla was found to have had a high number of crashes involving its driver-assist systems. Tesla, based in Austin, Texas, stopped using radar in its system and instead relies solely on cameras and computers — a system that Rajkumar calls “inherently unsafe.” The system’s computer, he said, can recognize only what’s in its memory. Flashing lights on an emergency vehicle, Rajkumar said, might confuse the system, as would anything that the computer hasn’t seen before. “Emergency vehicles may look very different from all the data that the Tesla software had been trained on,” he said. In addition to the publicly released crash data, NHTSA has sent investigative teams to far more incidents involving Teslas using electronic systems than other automakers. As part of a larger inquiry into crashes involving advanced driver assistance systems, the agency has sent teams to 34 crashes since 2016 in which the systems were thought to have been in use. Of the 34 crashes, 28 involved Teslas, according to a NHTSA document. NHTSA said in documents that it has received 191 reports of crashes involving Teslas on Autopilot and nonemergency vehicles, plus 16 more involving parked emergency vehicles or those with warning lights, for a total of 207. Of the 191, the agency removed 85 because of actions of other vehicles or insufficient data to make a firm assessment of the crashes. That left 106 that were included in the Autopilot investigation. It wasn’t clear if 207 matched the total number of Tesla crashes reported to NHTSA under the order. A NHTSA spokeswoman wouldn’t comment. The agency ordered automakers and tech companies to report crashes involving driver-assist systems, as well as fully autonomous driving systems. In defending its partially automated systems, Tesla has said that Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” cannot drive themselves, and that drivers should be ready to intervene at all times. The systems can keep cars in their lanes and away from other vehicles and objects. But in documents released last week, NHTSA raised questions about whether human drivers can intervene fast enough to prevent crashes. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” is designed to complete a route on its own with human supervision, with the eventual aim of driving itself and running a fleet of autonomous robo-taxis. In 2019, Musk had pledged to have the robo-taxis running in 2020. Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assist system detects hands on the steering wheel to make sure drivers are paying attention. But that’s inadequate, Rajkumar said. By contrast, systems such as GM’s monitor a driver’s eyes with a camera, he said, to make sure they’re looking forward."
12,Elon Musk To Take Questions From Twitter Employees For First Time Since Deal,business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk is set to meet with Twitter employees on Thursday for the first time since he made a deal to buy the company for $44 billion in April. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal sent a company-wide email Monday announcing the billionaire would attend an all-hands meeting this week. Staff reportedly will be allowed to submit questions in writing prior to the meeting. The news was first reported by Business Insider. Earlier this month, Twitter said it would offer Musk its “firehose” of data, including millions of daily tweets, in an effort to push the deal across the finish line, a source familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. Musk previously threatened to walk away from the agreement, accusing Twitter of withholding information on spam bot accounts, in a June 6 letter his lawyers sent to the company and shared in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. “As Twitter’s prospective owner, Mr. Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter’s business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing,” the letter reads. “To do both, he must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter’s business model—its active user base.” His lawyers said Twitter’s refusal to share this data is a result of concern over what Musk’s analysis could reveal about the social media giant, accusing Twitter of “thwarting his information rights.” “This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” the letter stated. Musk has repeatedly tweeted criticism of spam bots. Agrawal tried to address Musk’s concerns in a Twitter thread in May, saying spam accounts make up less than 5% of monthly daily active users on the platform. Now, we know we aren’t perfect at catching spam. And so this is why, after all the spam removal I talked about above, we know some still slips through. We measure this internally. And every quarter, we have estimated that <5% of reported mDAU for the quarter are spam accounts. In response, Musk tweeted a poop emoji. Musk is facing a lawsuit from a Twitter shareholder who accused him of deliberately criticizing the company in an effort to lower its stock price so he could secure a better price or walk away from the deal. When Twitter’s board announced the deal on April 25, with Musk agreeing to buy the company for $44 billion, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO pledged to make changes. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” Musk said in a press release at the time. “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.” But not all of Twitter’s employees shared his excitement. Some worry about what Musk’s takeover of the company will mean about their jobs and have privately expressed anger on internal Slack channels over Musk’s critical tweets about the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. Apart from Twitter, Musk also appeared to anger employees at two of his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, when he announced staff would be expected to work a minimum of 40 hours per week in the office, according to The New York Times. “If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned,” Musk wrote to Tesla employees. From @elonmusk on remote work… tell us how you really feel!(email from yesterday) pic.twitter.com/692C59YrDw This rule goes against Twitter’s policy to allow employees to work from home forever, if they choose to do so. In the meantime, Twitter is already making changes, including firing two executives in May and announcing a hiring freeze with an exception for “business critical roles.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Bitcoin Plunges As Major Crypto Lender Halts Operations,business," NEW YORK (AP) — Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were collapsing in price Monday, after a major crypto lender halted all withdrawals citing “extreme market conditions.” It is the second collapse of a part of the cryptocurrency world in the last two months. The stablecoin Terra imploded in early May, erasing tens of billions of dollars in a matter of hours. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $22,600 as of midday Monday, down more than 17% in the past day. Ethereum, another widely-followed cryptocurrency, was down more than 20%. On Sunday, the lending platform Celsius announced that it was pausing all withdrawals and transfers between accounts in order to “honor, over time, withdrawal obligations.” Celsius, with roughly 1.7 million customers, gave no indication in its announcement when it would allow users to access their funds. “There is a lot of work ahead as we consider various options, this process will take time, and there may be delays,” it said. Celsius is one of the bigger cryptocurrency lending platforms, with more than $11 billion in customer assets. In exchange for customers’ deposits, the company gives out extremely generous yields, upwards of 19% on some accounts. These lending platforms have come under scrutiny recently because they offer yields that normal markets could not support, and critics have called them effectively Ponzi schemes. Terra, and its token Luna, offered similar yields on customer deposits. Those tokens collapsed after huge customer withdrawals forced Terra’s operators to liquidate all of the assets being used to support their currencies. The collapse of Terra has spurred calls for reform from the cryptocurrency industry, and calls for Congressional regulation."
14,Starbucks Union Says Howard Schultz Broke The Law During New York Times Interview,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The union that represents Starbucks workers at roughly 150 stores has accused CEO Howard Schultz of violating labor law during a public interview with The New York Times this week, and has filed charges against the company at the National Labor Relations Board. Starbuck Workers United says that in a conversation with journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin at the Times’ DealBook D.C. policy forum on Thursday, Schultz threatened to refuse to bargain in good faith with the union. The charge hinges on comments Schultz made while discussing the coffee chain’s relationship with its workers in the context of the union campaign. “We have to demonstrate to our people they can trust us,” Schultz said, which prompted Sorkin to ask if he could ever envision “doing that and embracing the union as part of it?” Schultz flatly answered, “No.” Both the union and the employer are required to engage in meaningful dialogue when they negotiate a contract. The union says Schultz’s remark suggests he doesn’t intend to do so, and that it sends a message to employees that unionizing would be “futile.” Conveying futility to workers is also considered an unfair labor practice under collective bargaining law. Schultz told Sorkin he couldn’t embrace the union as part of his vision because “we are in business to exceed the expectations of our customers.” He argued that “the customer experience will be significantly challenged and ‘less than’ if a third party is integrated into our business.” That remark appears to be the basis of the union’s third charge against Schultz: “that he made an implied or actual threat that Starbucks will lose business because customers will go elsewhere if workers unionize.” “The union asked that the board seek an injunction related to Schultz’s comments.” In his interview with Sorkin, Schultz said the organizing effort has challenged the company’s relationship with its workers, and that Starbucks is now “in a battle for the hearts and minds of our people, and we are going to be successful.” The union said in its filing on Friday that Schultz has a “demonstrated propensity for using his national platform to make unlawful statements.” Starbucks Workers United previously accused Schultz of violating labor law when he announced that the company might roll out new benefits that he believed couldn’t legally be extended to new stores that are bargaining contracts. A Starbucks spokesperson on Saturday said that the union “misrepresented the facts,” and that Starbucks would do more “working side by side rather than across the bargaining table.” “We will bargain in good faith for those seeking third-party representation, and we will remain focused on building a future that offers the best possible Starbucks experience for our people and customers,” Reggie Borges, the spokesperson, said in an email. When one party believes the other broke the law, filing an unfair labor practice charge is the first step. An NLRB investigator would then look into the claim to determine whether there’s merit to the charge. If there is, board officials would try to reach a settlement with Starbucks to remedy the situation, and if that fails, they could end up prosecuting a case against the company. The union has filed a slew of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks since launching the organizing campaign last year, and board officials have found merit in many of those charges. An NLRB regional director in Western New York recently filed a sprawling complaint against the company, saying it broke the law by terminating half a dozen pro-union workers, disciplining and surveilling others and closing two stores in the area. “The union said in its filing on Friday that Schultz has a 'demonstrated propensity for using his national platform to make unlawful statements.'” None of these charges have yet been litigated before an administrative law judge, however. Starbucks maintains that it hasn’t broken the law during the campaign. The company also insists that it is not “anti-union,” despite comments like those from Schultz at the DealBook forum. In some cases, the union has asked that NLRB officials go to federal court seeking an injunction against Starbucks to stop what the union believes is illegal behavior. In its filing Friday, the union asked that the board seek an injunction related to Schultz’s comments, saying his remarks could inflict “irreparable injury” on the organizing campaign. Earlier this week, a federal judge rejected the union’s pursuit of an injunction that would have put three union organizers back on the job in Arizona. Starbucks has fired more than 20 union organizers around the country, but the company maintains that all the terminations were justified and not retaliatory. The people who have lost their jobs include the so-called Memphis Seven, a group of Tennessee baristas who were fired after giving an in-store interview to a local television station. Board officials are pursuing a case against the company over those firings, saying they were illegal and the workers should be reinstated. Despite the loss of seven organizers, Starbucks Workers United recently won a decisive victory in a union election at the Memphis store, with workers voting 11-3 in favor of joining.

15,Massachusetts Trader Joe’s Workers Seek Election To Form Company's First Union,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Trader Joe’s employees in Massachusetts who hope to form the grocery chain’s first union say they have gathered enough signatures from their co-workers to hold an election at their store. The nascent union campaign known as Trader Joe’s United announced Wednesday that it had filed a petition asking the National Labor Relations Board to hold a vote for the store in Hadley, north of Springfield. The campaign is a new, independent group not affiliated with an established labor union. At least 30% of a workplace needs to sign union authorization cards in order for the NLRB to greenlight an election. Trader Joe’s United said it had gathered “well over” that many signatures, without offering an exact figure. The labor board must review the workers’ petition to determine whether they’ve cleared the threshold and are entitled to a vote. A successful union campaign at one Trader Joe’s store could quickly spread to others within the chain of more than 500 locations. That’s clearly been the case for Starbucks, where workers have unionized more than 120 stores in a matter of months after decades of the company being union-free. “We have a ton of support and we’re just moving forward the best we can.” A Trader Joe’s spokesperson told HuffPost earlier this week that it welcomed a vote and would not stand in the way of one. “We believe Trader Joe’s is a great place to work and our compensation, benefits and working conditions are among the best in the grocery business. We welcome a fair vote and are prepared to hold a vote if more than 30% of the Crew wants one,” the spokesperson, Nakia Rohde, said in an email, using the company term for workers. Trader Joe’s has brushed off unionization efforts in the past. In 2020, CEO Dan Bane called a union organizing campaign a “distraction,” saying a union could not improve on what Trader Joe’s offers. He invited a union vote wherever employees wanted one. HuffPost reported Tuesday that workers at the Hadley store have filed unfair labor practice charges against the company, accusing managers of interfering with their union efforts. Two workers told HuffPost they had been ordered to remove their union pins or go home for the day without pay. Under NLRB precedent, there are few circumstances in which an employer can legally require a worker to remove union insignia. Maeg Yosef, a Trader Joe’s employee of 18 years and spokesperson for the union campaign, told HuffPost she was among those told to remove their pins. She said management had also removed union literature from a break room at one point. Although the campaign does not have staff attorneys, labor attorneys have been advising the workers on their rights, according to Yosef. “We have a ton of support and we’re just moving forward the best we can,” she said. Yosef said many workers’ perception of Trader Joe’s has changed in recent years. The grocer has long been seen as a decent place to work with good benefits, but the company has taken some steps that have angered longtime employees. As HuffPost recently reported, this year it slashed retirement benefits by half for many workers, reducing the company’s 401(k) contribution from 10% of wages earned in a year down to 5%. Jamie Edwards, an organizer at the Hadley store who’s been with Trader Joe’s for nine years, said the grocer lost much of its sheen while workers toiled through the pandemic, feeling as though their safety concerns weren’t taken seriously. Edwards’ retirement contributions were slashed despite having a nearly decade-long tenure. “I feel like the company was doing everything they could to make people want to unionize,” Edwards said. By declining to affiliate with a known labor group, Trader Joe’s United is following a path similar to the Amazon Labor Union, which pulled off a stunning upset at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, earlier this year. Independent union efforts typically lack the resources and experience of well-funded labor campaigns, but they are more immune to management’s efforts to paint them as a “third party,” since everyone involved in the union is a worker. Election petitions are sometimes withdrawn after they’ve been filed, if the union turns out not to have sufficient support. Such was the case initially with the Amazon Labor Union, which filed for an election, withdrew that petition, then re-filed for the ultimately successful vote in March. A union needs to win a simple majority of votes cast in order to become the workers’ bargaining representative. Unions typically go for an election once they’ve secured the backing of a supermajority in the workplace, assuming the company will run an aggressive anti-union campaign that erodes support. But they can still succeed by filing for an election with only a minority of support, as the Amazon Labor Union did, so long as they continue to organize in the run-up to the vote and grow their base. Yosef said the Hadley store recently received a visit from a Trader Joe’s executive, Jon Basalone, the chain’s president of stores. The company said the visit was standard practice, but Yosef said she believes it was certainly tied to the union effort. “If they’re coming out here and sending Jon Basalone already, I think it just means that they’re that scared,” she said.

0,Starbucks Workers Unionize Store Where ‘Memphis Seven’ Were Fired,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost In February, Starbucks fired seven union activists who were trying to organize a store in Memphis, Tennessee. Now that store is unionized. The union Workers United decisively won an election to represent baristas at the store by a count of 11-3, according to a ballot tally held Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board. That makes the store one of roughly 120 Starbucks locations that have unionized in just a few months. The campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has been organizing stores around the country, but the vote at the Memphis store at Poplar Avenue and S. Highland Street was one of the most closely watched due to the firings. The NLRB, which oversees private-sector union elections, has not yet certified the Memphis results. In a tweet Tuesday, the campaign said “workers showed Starbucks what solidarity looks like.” BREAKING: The Poplar & Highland store in Memphis, TN just WON THEIR UNION ELECTION 11-3. This is the store where Starbucks fired 7 of the union leaders in an attempt to scare the entire country out of organizing. Today, workers showed @Starbucks what solidarity looks like. Starbucks terminated the seven workers after a local television crew filmed an interview about the union campaign inside the store while it was closed. The company said the firings were not because of the workers’ union activism, but because they ran afoul of store policy by letting non-employees into the store outside of business hours, among other alleged rule violations. But a regional director for the NLRB accused Starbucks of retaliating against the “Memphis Seven.” The director filed charges against Starbucks that could lead to a trial before an administrative law judge with witnesses called. None of the allegations have been litigated yet. Workers found to have been illegally fired can eventually be reinstated on the job, although the legal process often takes years. The NLRB’s regional director has also gone to federal court seeking an injunction to put the seven Starbucks workers back on the job temporarily. Board officials can pursue such an injunction when they believe the board’s normal processes won’t be able to protect workers in the midst of an organizing campaign where the employer has broken the law. The firing of the seven Memphis workers is part of a much larger legal fight between Starbucks and the union. Workers United accused Starbucks of waging a scorched-earth campaign meant to stifle the union’s momentum, while the company denies it has broken the law. Another regional director for the NLRB recently hit the company with a sprawling complaint involving the firing of six other workers and the closures of two stores in Western New York. The complaint alleges that Starbucks illegally disciplined and surveilled workers who supported the union, and that CEO Howard Schultz broke the law by offering workers “an increase in benefits” if they declined to unionize. A Starbucks spokesperson called those allegations false, saying the company “look[s] forward to presenting our evidence when the allegations are adjudicated.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Trader Joe’s Workers Say The Company Is Cracking Down On Their Union Effort,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Jamie Edwards recently wore a union pin on their hat while working at the Trader Joe’s in Hadley, Massachusetts. Some customers noticed the pin and told Edwards they supported workers’ effort to unionize the store. But Edwards says an assistant manager was less enamored with the “Trader Joe’s United” button. “They told me I wasn’t allowed to wear that on my hat,” recalled the 33-year-old, who’s worked for Trader Joe’s for almost a decade. “Initially, I complied, for the sake of not causing any more trouble.” But while on a lunch break, Edwards pulled out their phone and read about rulings from the National Labor Relations Board related to workers wearing union insignia on the job. In most cases, employers can’t legally prohibit it. So Edwards returned to work and showed the manager what Google had to say on the matter. “After that, we were sort of at an impasse,” Edwards recounted. “She says, ‘If you insist on wearing it, I will have to ask you to go home.’ ... I ended up having to go home and miss the rest of that shift.” Edwards said they had to burn a few hours of paid time off to make sure they didn’t lose money for the day. The alleged dismissal is now part of a batch of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed against Trader Joe’s amid a budding union campaign. Pro-union employees in Hadley are hoping to create the chain’s first unionized store under the name Trader Joe’s United, an independent effort not affiliated with an established labor group. Edwards is an organizer for the campaign. Workers have criticized the grocery chain for slashing retirement benefits during the pandemic and making it harder to qualify for health care coverage as a part-time worker. Now they’re accusing Trader Joe’s of illegal retaliation for their union activism. “These tactics do interfere and put pressure on the crew. They are allowing anti-union crew members to be very vocal in the store.” In a June 2 filing with the labor board obtained through a public records request, union supporters allege Trader Joe’s retaliated against them by sending Edwards home for the day, by removing union literature from a common area of the store, and by “maintaining work rules that prohibit workers” from talking about pay and working conditions. The charges are now under investigation by the NLRB. If board officials find merit in them, they could pursue a case against the grocer. Although the remedies are weak for labor violations, an employer could be forced to change company policy if it’s deemed to run afoul of the law. Workers can seek a union election when at least 30% of the proposed bargaining unit has signed union authorization cards, though they typically want to secure more support than that, under the assumption the company will run an anti-union campaign that weakens support. In the case of Trader Joe’s, a successful unionization attempt at one store could easily spread to others, as it has at Starbucks, where Workers United has organized more than a hundred stores in a matter of months. A Trader Joe’s spokesperson did not directly address the allegations related to union pins, but said the company was committed to a “fair vote” on whether or not to unionize. “We believe Trader Joe’s is a great place to work and our compensation, benefits and working conditions are among the best in the grocery business. We welcome a fair vote and are prepared to hold a vote if more than 30% of the Crew wants one,” the spokesperson, Nakia Rohde, said in an email, using the Trader Joe’s term for workers. “A Crew Member in our Hadley store stated to the press weeks ago that 65% of the Crew agrees with their efforts. We are ready to hold a vote when they are.” Maeg Yosef, a Trader Joe’s veteran of 18 years involved in the union campaign, said the Hadley location recently received a visit from executive Jon Basalone, who serves as president of stores for the California-based chain. It’s common for big companies facing nascent union campaigns to send in high-level executives to meet with managers and workers in an effort to blunt the organizing drive. (Starbucks flew in longtime CEO Howard Schultz to speak to workers in Buffalo, New York, and its North America president, Rossann Williams, spent weeks inside stores that were considering unionizing.). Rhode said there was nothing unusual about Basalone’s visit to Hadley: “Jon spends a majority of his time visiting stores and talking with Crew Members around the country. This is common practice among our leadership team.” “She says, ‘If you insist on wearing it, I will have to ask you to go home.’ ... I ended up having to go home and miss the rest of that shift.” Yosef said she never personally saw Basalone in the store because she was also sent home for wearing a union pin. “These tactics do interfere and put pressure on the crew. They are allowing anti-union crew members to be very vocal in the store,” she said. “It’s just a distraction, and we’re trying not to get too wrapped up in it. We anticipated there would be union-busting. We know the company’s history and we’ll just deal with it.” Yosef said managers initially removed union flyers from the break room. She said workers put them back up, and they have remained there since. “There’s also a lot of anti-union stuff up, too,” she said. Edwards said at least three other workers were told to remove their union pins. Union supporters have decided to comply for now and file charges against Trader Joe’s if managers continue telling them to remove their pins, rather than be sent home for the day and lose pay or end up fired, Edwards said. A recent copy of the Trader Joe’s employee handbook obtained by HuffPost says workers can’t add anything at all to their uniforms: “None of these items is to be adorned with added logos, statements, décor, symbolism, or messages of any kind except as approved by your Captain.” But the NLRB has found that employers can only institute broad bans on union insignia in “special circumstances,” like when a button on a uniform poses a safety hazard. Workers often argue that their employers’ handbook rules are “overly broad” and infringe on their right to what’s known as “protected concerted activity” – i.e., joining together with co-workers to improve working conditions. Unlike an established union, Trader Joe’s United does not have its own legal team. But Yosef and Edwards said labor lawyers have been advising workers on what their rights are, and they plan to file more charges against the company with the labor board. “These are things I expect to happen,” Edwards said. “The company is going to put pressure on [managers]. Most people, when their boss is putting pressure on them, they’re going to do what they’re told.” Correction: This story originally misspelled Nakia Rohde’s last name. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Elon Musk Threatens To Walk Away From Twitter Deal,business," DETROIT (AP) — Elon Musk is threatening to walk away from his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter, accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts. Lawyers for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO made the threat in a letter to Twitter dated Monday, and Twitter disclosed it in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The letter says Musk has repeatedly asked for the information since May 9, about a month after his offer to buy the company, so he could evaluate how many of the company’s 229 million accounts are fake. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has said that Twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5% of its accounts are fake. But Musk has disputed that, contending in a May tweet that 20% or more are bogus. Shares of Twitter Inc. slid just under 3% Monday, likely incensing Twitter shareholders who filed a suit against Musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock. Shares of Twitter are down 23% in the last month. Twitter said in a statement Monday that it “has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.” “We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,” it added. Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share back in April. A number of Musk’s actions since, including a public spat with Twitter’s CEO about the fake accounts — on Twitter — has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to go through with the deal, or least lower his offer. Musk’s lawyers say in the letter that Twitter has offered only to provide details about the company’s testing methods. But they contend that’s “tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk’s data requests,” and constitutes a “material breach” of the merger agreement that gives Musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses. “This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” the letter says. Musk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are Twitter’s lax methodologies. The Twitter sale agreement allows Musk to get out of the deal if there is a “material adverse effect” caused by the company. It defines that as a change that negatively affects Twitter’s business or financial conditions. Twitter has said all along that it’s proceeding with the deal, although it hasn’t scheduled a shareholder vote on it. Last month Musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold, which experts said he can’t do. If he walks away, he could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee. Musk’s latest maneuver shows how he is “looking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price,” said Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College. But Quinn said it’s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence. “I doubt he would be allowed to walk away,” Quinn said. “At some point, the board of Twitter will tire of this and file a suit” asking a judge to force Musk to stick to the deal. Twitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for years, while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low. “If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company’s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates,” the Musk letter says, adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data. The bot problem is a longtime fixation for Musk, one of Twitter’s most active celebrity users, whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams. Musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other Twitter users, as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach. The letter signed by Musk attorney Mike Ringler that copied other lawyers, points to a spat over a June 1 letter from Twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale. It says Twitter is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal. Twitter also has to cooperate with Musk’s effort to get the financing for the deal, including providing information that’s “reasonably requested” by Musk, the letter states. The letter contends that Musk is not required to explain his rationale for requesting data or submit to “new conditions the company has attempted to impose” on his right to get the numbers. It alleges that Musk is entitled to the data about the core of Twitter’s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership. ——- Matt O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island."
3,Elon Musk Reportedly Tells Tesla Workers To Return To The Office Or Quit,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk has reportedly ordered employees at Tesla and SpaceX to say goodbye to remote work and return to the office, or start looking for another job. The CEO sent an email late Tuesday to employees demanding they work a minimum of 40 hours per week in the office, The New York Times reported. The email reiterated what he had previously told his executive staff requiring that they be in “a main Tesla office, not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties, for example being responsible for Fremont factory human relations, but having your office be in another state.” Like many other companies, Tesla switched to a remote work lifestyle when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. In his email titled “To be super clear,” he declared that working remotely is no longer acceptable for staff. From @elonmusk on remote work… tell us how you really feel!(email from yesterday) pic.twitter.com/692C59YrDw “Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,” he wrote. “Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Musk went on to point out his own record of attending the office frequently. “The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much ― so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.” HuffPost has reached out to Tesla, Inc. for comment. After the email was sent to employees, it surfaced on Twitter where many were not happy to hear the billionaire’s stance on remote work. One Twitter user asked Musk to share his thoughts on people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept, to which he replied, “They should pretend to work somewhere else.” They should pretend to work somewhere else Musk’s announcement comes just weeks after the inventor applauded Tesla China employees for “burning the 3 am oil” while slamming American workers for “trying to avoid going to work at all.” The business mogul is currently amid a potential deal to acquire Twitter for $44 billion, however, last month Musk said the deal was on hold until the company can verify that less than 5% of its user accounts are fake or spam.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Elon Musk Says He Welcomes Recession So Money Stops 'Raining' Down On 'Fools',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost In what many critics deemed a spectacular self-own, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in a Tweet that he welcomed a global recession so money would stop “raining” down on “fools.” Musk posted the comment Thursday in response to a question concerning his attitude about a possible coming recession. As for raining money, critics were happy to point out that Musk has been the recipient of millions of dollars in tax breaks ($64 million from Texas alone), and a very hefty government loan, among other support. Tesla scooped up a $465 million loan in 2009 as part of a federal stimulus package, which financed the development and manufacture of Tesla’s groundbreaking Model S. In 2015, the Los Angles Times estimated that Musk’s companies had already benefited from some $5 billion in government support. In an added dig, the self-awareness-challenged Musk accused people who have been stuck working remotely because of the pandemic of now being under the delusion that they “don’t actually need to word hard.” He chuckled: “Rude awakening inbound!” Musk figured in his tweet that a good recession would last up to 18 months so “negative cash flow” resource-gobbling enterprises can “die” — apparently forgetting that it took Tesla nine years to post its first annual profit. Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!

11,Lawsuit Accuses Elon Musk Of Trashing Twitter To Drive Down Price,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk has been hit with a lawsuit from a Twitter shareholder who accuses the Tesla CEO of criticizing the company he has agreed to buy and sowing doubts about the deal in order to drive down Twitter’s value. The proposed class action, filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims Musk aimed to drive down Twitter’s stock price because he either wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a lower purchase price. The suit, which also names Twitter, argues that Musk’s attacks violated both the nondisparagement and nondisclosure clauses of his contract with the company. “Musk proceeded to make statements, send tweets, and engage in conduct designed to create doubt about the deal and drive Twitter’s stock down substantially in order to create leverage that Musk hoped to use to either back out of the purchase or to re-negotiate the buyout price by as much as 25% which, if accomplished, would result in an $11 billion reduction in the Buyout consideration,” the suit states. “Musk’s conduct was and continues to be illegal, in violation of the California Corporations Code, and contrary to the contractual terms he agreed to in the deal,” the suit adds. Musk made an agreement last month to purchase the social media company for $44 billion, but has since repeatedly publicly complained about Twitter. In particular, he has challenged the number of bots or spam accounts, which Twitter has stated amount to less than 5% of accounts. Musk wildly speculated at a tech conference earlier this month that the percentage of fake accounts could be as high as 95%. He also announced he was putting the purchase on “hold,” though insisted he was still “committed” to the deal. He later said a lower purchase price wasn’t out of the question. Since Musk’s acquisition bid — and the grumbling — Twitter’s share price has dropped more than 12%, and Tesla’s is down about 28%. Twitter’s shares closed Thursday at $39.54 — 27% below Musk’s $54.20-per-share offer to buy the company. Musk was using Tesla stock to finance the Twitter purchase. But he has since upped his personal funding by more than $6 billion and secured an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing, according to regulatory filings on Wednesday. The lawsuit also accuses Musk of insider trading by purchasing stock while he was talking to company board members, and failing to meet a legally required deadline to inform the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had acquired a 5% stake in the company. The SEC has sent a letter to Musk demanding an explanation for missing the deadline. Musk could not be reached for comment, and he hasn’t issued any statement on the lawsuit.

12,Trader Joe’s Cut Workers' Retirement Benefits During The Pandemic,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Workers at Trader Joe’s found out in January that retirement benefits had been cut in half for many employees. The revelation came on the second page of the company’s internal newsletter, The Bulletin, right after an explanation of the company’s No. 1 value: “Integrity.” “The definition of Integrity is simple ... it means that you treat others as you would like to be treated,” the newsletter explained. The change to the company’s 401(k) plan was not described as a cut, but workers familiar with the retirement plan knew that’s what it was. Employees were used to receiving an annual lump-sum contribution from the company equal to 10% of their wages earned the previous year. But those with less than a decade of service at Trader Joe’s would only receive 5% for their work performed in 2021, the newsletter said. Assistant managers with the same amount of time would receive 7%, while all store managers would receive 10%. Workers with 10 years on the job could keep their 10% annual contribution, but that stipulation came with a catch. They must have worked at least 700 hours in each of those years to qualify for the higher deposit. So workers with long tenures could end up with just 5% if they had taken an extended leave or reduced their work schedules temporarily years ago, perhaps to deal with personal issues or a health problem. “Cutting people’s retirements during a pandemic? How is that 'integrity'?” The Bulletin noted that it was a “discretionary” contribution, not a contractual guarantee, and the company for years has offered the same caveat in its handbook for “crew” members, which is Trader Joe’s lingo for employees. But according to four workers who spoke with HuffPost, employees felt blindsided by the smaller contributions, especially having worked nearly two years through a pandemic, facing COVID-19, product shortages and angry customers. “It was really upsetting for a lot of crew members,” said Maeg Yosef, a Trader Joe’s worker in Massachusetts. “I think that’s the trend. The company seems to be moving away from being a place where you can have a career, support your family and feel relatively secure for a job in the grocery industry.” Yosef is part of a new union campaign that was first reported by More Perfect Union. Trader Joe’s did not respond to numerous emails and phone calls from HuffPost seeking details on the company’s retirement plan. But earlier copies of the crew handbook noted a standard 10% annual contribution. (In one version, included as an exhibit in 2016 litigation, the company said everyone would get 10% except for workers under age 30, who would receive 5%.) A more recent copy of the handbook obtained by HuffPost, dated March 2021, did not list any amount, saying only that Trader Joe’s “may make a discretionary contribution.” Around 62% of private-sector workers are eligible for 401(k)-style, defined-contribution retirement plans through their jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many employers chip into these plans by matching the contributions the worker puts in, up to a certain share of the worker’s wages, often between 3 and 6%. Trader Joe’s erstwhile contribution equaling 10% of a worker’s wages for the year appears to have been on the high side for a non-union grocer. And unlike matching schemes, workers receive the company’s contribution whether they put in their own money or not. But slashing the contribution in half amounts to a significant cut in overall compensation, potentially in the thousands of dollars depending on a worker’s wage and scheduled hours. The change to a worker’s retirement savings over time could be significant, especially once the loss of tax-deferred investment gains are taken into account. It is not clear whether Trader Joe’s might restore the higher contribution for 2022 or subsequent years. Employees said the change has not only angered co-workers but energized talks about a union beyond Massachusetts. “Cutting people’s retirements during a pandemic? How is that ‘integrity’?” said one worker at a store in Pennsylvania, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “I was planning on being here my whole career, I was so happy. But they just keep chipping away at things.” None of Trader Joe’s stores currently have union representation. The campaign in Massachusetts, called Trader Joe’s United, is independently run and, according to Yosef, already gathering interest from other stores. Collective bargaining is common in the broader industry, with the United Food and Commercial Workers representing more than 800,000 grocery workers, including at major chains owned by Kroger, Albertsons and other companies. Do you work at Trader Joe’s? Email our reporter and share your story. You can remain anonymous if you prefer. Another Trader Joe’s worker said previous union efforts never seemed to gain much traction at the chain, with the consensus being that “Trader Joe’s is pretty good to their employees.” But the worker said longtime crew members have been bothered by the 401(k) change, as well as an increase to the wage floor that hasn’t translated into meaningful pay hikes for more experienced workers. “When you start seeing that there are some real backdoor-style things going on, you get pissed and start to think, ‘Well, other grocery stores do unionize,’” they explained. The worker said they knew of two co-workers who believed they were entitled to 10% contributions for 2021 because of their tenures, only to discover they were receiving 5% because they didn’t carry enough hours at a certain point. A collective bargaining agreement, they said, could head off any such surprises. “If you have a contract, then there’s nothing they can touch,” the worker said. It would make sense for an employer to cut a 401(k) benefit as opposed to wages to save money, since a certain share of workers are unlikely to notice or care, especially younger ones for whom retirement is a far-off abstraction. Many grocery workers would be unable to afford making regular contributions on their own end, perhaps making it less likely they’d pay close attention to the plan. “The company seems to be moving away from being a place where you can have a career, support your family and feel relatively secure for a job in the grocery industry” According to the company’s handbook, Trader Joe’s gradually vests its employer contributions over time, so that workers are not fully entitled to the money the company has put into the plan until they’ve worked there for six years. Workers who leave Trader Joe’s before then would be leaving behind a percentage of the company contributions. Such vesting schedules are common among employer retirement plans. One Trader Joe’s veteran said she had envisioned the job only as transitional work, and didn’t expect to work for the grocer for more than a year or two. But eventually several years had passed, and she’d grown more reliant on the retirement plan than she ever anticipated. She was alarmed to see the Trader Joe’s contribution reduced. She said those who think the plan was generous to begin with are missing the point. “No one is giving us anything; we are working for this,” she said. “We should not be praising Trader Joe’s for doing the bare minimum. We just live in a place where we’ve normalized not making enough money to survive, and the idea that because you’re working retail you don’t deserve to live a normal life.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Walmart’s Juneteenth-Themed Ice Cream Ignites Outrage On Twitter,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Walmart is in hot water over its Juneteenth-themed ice cream. The multinational retail corporation announced it would review and potentially pull its ice cream commemorating Juneteenth after the product was blasted on Twitter. Social media users were outraged by the dessert, which consists of a swirl of red velvet and cheesecake flavors. On Twitter, many shoppers condemned the company for appearing to profit off the important holiday, its history and Black people. Walmart’s label on the ice cream, which has been widely shared across social media reads: “Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation and enduring hope.” Comedian Roy Wood Jr.’s viral tweet about the controversial frozen treat criticized the absurdity of Juneteenth-themed branding. “Would you like some Juneteenth Ice cream on a Juneteenth plate as you sip your beer in a Juneteenth Koozie?” he tweeted.

Walmart literally saw a successful small Black business and thought they could get away with stealing their flavor and re-branding it for Juneteenth. Anyways, Creamalicious is available at Target. pic.twitter.com/y3DyzpYtGv In all seriousness......If you have seen the Juneteenth Ice Cream from Walmart, go ahead and grab some Creamalicious Red Velvet Cheesecake instead! Walmart could have used this opportunity to highlight this brand instead of making a cheap copycat for OUR Independence Day. pic.twitter.com/avlIkjvoOU Juneteenth honors Black communities and commemorates the end of slavery in America. Although the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing enslaved people, was issued in 1863, there was minimal enforcement in Texas, which meant enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, weren’t informed they were free until June 19, 1865. Walmart apologized for the product in a statement. “Juneteenth holiday marks a commemoration and celebration of freedom and independence,” the company wrote in a statement to HuffPost. “However, we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.” Juneteenth became an official government holiday last year after President Joe Biden signed a bill creating Juneteenth National Independence Day. The move to solidify it as a federal holiday gained popularity following protests in response to George Floyd’s murder by a white police officer.

14,Airbnb Pulls Out Of China,business," BEIJING (AP) — Airbnb Inc. announced Tuesday it will stop representing short-term rental properties in China and focus its business in the country on serving Chinese tourists looking for lodgings abroad. Airbnb joins a series of foreign internet companies including Yahoo Inc. and eBay Inc. that pulled out of China after running into fierce local competition and regulatory barriers. “We have made the difficult decision to refocus our efforts in China on outbound travel and suspend our homes and Experiences of Hosts in China, starting from July 30, 2022,” said the chief strategy officer of Airbnb China, Nathan Blecharczyk, in a statement on its social media account. Landlords represented by Airbnb have had more than 25 million guest arrivals since 2016, according to Blecharczyk’s statement. The Chinese government has blocked foreign tourists from visiting since the pandemic hit in early 2020 and has told the Chinese public to avoid foreign travel that isn’t essential for business or study."
15,Activision Blizzard Workers Form Gaming Industry's First Major Union,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost A group of workers at the video game giant Activision Blizzard have voted decisively to unionize, giving organized labor a toehold in an industry known for its grueling schedules. A ballot count held Monday by the National Labor Relations Board showed 19 employees of Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software were in favor of joining the Communications Workers of America union, while just three employees were opposed. The board has not certified the results yet to make them official. The union would be the first at a major U.S. gaming company. The Raven workers are Wisconsin-based quality assurance testers who make sure the studio’s games run well for users. They make up a fraction of the overall Activision Blizzard workforce but signify an important toehold for organized labor inside the company. The union would represent about 30 workers, according to NLRB filings. Pro-union employees have been organizing at Raven under the name Game Workers Alliance, saying brutal schedules have taken a toll on their physical and mental health. They’ve called for pay equity and more transparency from management, and cited “continued cultural and ethical conflicts” within the broader company. Raven laid off a dozen quality assurance workers in December, prompting a walkout threat  by remaining staffers, who said the job cuts “go directly against the positive culture that Raven has created over the years.” Happy union day! We won! pic.twitter.com/nzJ4A3J3RB The following month, workers told Raven leadership that a majority had signed union cards, and they asked that management voluntarily recognize the union and start bargaining a first contract. The company declined, so workers filed for an election with the NLRB. Activision Blizzard asked the labor board to enlarge the bargaining unit to encompass more workers, a common tactic employers use to dilute union support. Board officials turned down the company’s request, setting the stage for this month’s mail-in election. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson said in a statement on the vote Monday that the company still believes the election should have been much larger. “We respect and believe in the right of all employees to decide whether or not to support or vote for a union,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We believe that an important decision that will impact the entire Raven Software studio of roughly 350 people should not be made by 19 Raven employees.” Activision Blizzard, which produces the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises, has been rocked by allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination in recent years. The company recently reached an $18 million settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, while the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is pursuing its own lawsuit against the company alleging a toxic “bro culture.” On Monday, Bloomberg reported that labor board officials were pursuing a case against Activision Blizzard, accusing the company of illegally retaliating against pro-union workers. The company denied the allegations. This story has been updated with comment from Activision Blizzard. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"

0,"Starbucks Leaving Russian Market, Shutting 130 Stores",business," Starbucks is pulling out of the Russian market. In a memo to employees Monday, the Seattle coffee giant said it decided to close its 130 stores and no longer have a brand presence in Russia. Starbucks said it will continue to pay its nearly 2,000 Russian employees for six months and help them transition to new jobs. Starbucks’ move follows McDonald’s exit from the Russian market last week. McDonald’s is selling its stores — which are almost all owned by the company — to an existing Russian franchisee. The stores won’t be allowed to use McDonald’s name or menu. Starbucks’ stores are owned and operated by Alshaya Group, a Kuwait-based franchise operator. A spokesperson for Alshaya referred questions to Starbucks on Monday. Starbucks entered the Russian market in 2007. In early March, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Starbucks announced that it would keep its Russian stores open but donate any profits to humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. But a few days later — after Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald’s and others temporarily halted their business in Russia — Starbucks changed course and temporarily closed its Russian stores. “Through this dynamic situation, we will continue to make decisions that are true to our mission and values and communicate with transparency,” then Starbucks Corp. CEO Kevin Johnson wrote in a message to employees."
1,Baby Formula Manufacturer Apologizes For Shortage,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The CEO of one of the Big Three baby formula manufacturers in America has apologized for the critical shortage of the product. Abbott Nutrition CEO Robert Ford blamed the shortage on a shutdown of its Michigan plant in February and a voluntary recall after four babies became sick with bacterial infections after consuming company products. An investigation has since found no link between the plant and the illnesses, Ford said. “We’re sorry to every family we’ve let down since our voluntary recall exacerbated our nation’s baby formula shortage,” Ford wrote in a column in The Washington Post on Saturday. “We believe our voluntary recall was the right thing to do. We will not take risks when it comes to the health of children. The data collected during the investigation, genetic sequencing, retained product samples and available products from the four complaints did not find any connection between our products and the four reported illnesses in children,” he added. “However, the FDA’s investigation did discover a bacteria in our plant that we will not tolerate. I have high expectations of this company, and we fell short of them,” Ford wrote. Republicans have tried to blame the shortage on the Biden administration. President Joe Biden is currently utilizing the Defense Production Act to aid formula companies with needed supplies and flying in formula from other countries. Some 78,000 pounds of specialty infant formula for more than half a million baby bottles arrived Sunday in Indianapolis from Europe. It was the first of several flights expected from overseas. Ford called serious problems caused by the shortage for some babies “tragic and heartbreaking, and it is consuming my thoughts and those of my colleagues.” He added: “Our highest priority is getting babies safe, quality formula they need as fast as possible.” Ford said his company is working to step up manufacturing and prioritize formula, and to locate other sources of formula, particularly for the most critically needed for hospitalized babies. The company is also establishing a $5 million fund that will be independently administered to “help these families with medical and living expenses as they weather this storm,” Ford wrote. The closed plant should be open by the first week in June, he noted. “Finally, we are making significant investments to ensure this never happens again,” he vowed.

2,Labor Officials Are Cracking Down Hard On Starbucks For Its Anti-Union Campaign,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The union campaign at Starbucks has organized roughly 80 stores around the country in a matter of months, winning the vast majority of elections that have been held so far. CEO Howard Schultz and his team have managed to defeat the campaign at only a handful of stores where workers voted against a union. Now it looks like one of Schultz’s few victories might end up in his loss column. An official with the National Labor Relations Board has requested that Starbucks be ordered to bargain with the union, Workers United, at a store in the Buffalo, New York, area where the union lost an election late last year. The official argues that Starbucks tainted the process with illegal tactics and that holding a do-over election won’t cut it: The company should have to recognize the union and negotiate. Such a request is not common at the labor board, and shows how egregious officials believe Starbucks’ behavior to have been in western New York. “It was a really long road to get here and very frustrating to face a company that repeatedly violated labor law to coerce workers into voting ‘no,’” said Will Westlake, a pro-union barista at the store in question. “Today we can say we took notes, and the federal government agrees this was one of the worst anti-union campaigns.” The bargaining order request is part of a complaint filed against Starbucks by Linda Leslie, a regional director for the NLRB. The filing alleges the company committed a litany of labor law violations by terminating half a dozen pro-union workers, disciplining and surveilling others, closing stores and changing work policies as it battled the organizing campaign in New York. “It was a really long road to get here and very frustrating to face a company that repeatedly violated labor law.” The complaint was originally filed earlier this month without the bargaining order request. Leslie filed an amended complaint Thursday to include it. That complaint will be litigated before an administrative law judge, who will decide whether Starbucks should have to bargain with workers at the store on Camp Road in Hamburg, New York. The process is subject to appeals and could take years. In one of the first elections for the campaign, workers at the Camp Road store voted 12-8 against unionizing. A bargaining order would effectively vacate that loss and unionize the store. It would also serve as a big symbolic victory for the union campaign, which maintains that Starbucks can’t win without playing dirty. Starbucks could not immediately be reached for comment, but the company said earlier this month that it denied all the allegations in Leslie’s broader complaint: “We believe the allegations contained in the complaint are false, and we look forward to presenting our evidence when the allegations are adjudicated.” There have been 94 ballot counts held so far for Starbucks elections, according to the NLRB. The union has won 79 and lost just nine; the results are not definitive in another six. Some election results have been challenged by either side and could change. The labor board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, has laid out an aggressive agenda that would crack down on companies that try to illegally bust unions. Abruzzo has specifically said she will try to make greater use of bargaining orders when she believes they are warranted. Officials can seek them when an employer has created such an atmosphere of intimidation that re-running an election won’t suffice. In the complaint, Leslie argues that the firing of union supporters and other forms of retaliation make it so “traditional remedies” won’t do in the case of Camp Road. She says workers made their desire to unionize clear by a majority signing union cards, and that Starbucks should therefore have to bargain. As part of the complaint, Leslie alleges that Starbucks tried to chill union support by permanently closing one store in the area and temporarily closing another, which was later reopened as a training center. Richard Bensinger, an organizer with the campaign, argued that the closures were meant to have a broad effect. “It’s not designed just to scare people at that store ― it’s to scare people all over the country,” he said. Westlake said the workers from one of the closed stores ended up transferred to Camp Road and that, given their recent experience, they were leery of voting for the union. He believes the closure undeniably had an effect on how the Camp Road vote played out. “They all said, ‘We tried to organize and they shut down our store,’” Westlake said. “It’s just unreal some of the things that [Starbucks] did. … You’re supposed to have a democratic process. There’s nothing less democratic than the campaign Starbucks tried to run at Camp Road.” Starbucks executive Rossann Williams spent weeks in Buffalo last year while workers were organizing, as she and other managers tried to sway them against the union. In her complaint alleging labor law violations, Leslie says that either Williams or Schultz should have to read a script informing workers of their rights that have been violated, or stand in the presence of a board official that does so, and then have the video made available to stores around the country.

3,Wall Street Appears Headed For Another Rocky Day,business," NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street headed for more losses at the open following the previous day’s rout amid persistently high inflation and its potential effect on corporate profits and consumer spending. Futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9% Thursday before the bell. Shares in Europe and Asia fell sharply following plunging U.S. markets. Germany’s DAX was down 1.6% at midday, while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 1.7% and Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 2.1%. On Wednesday, the Dow sank more than 1,100 points, or 3.6%. The S&P 500 had its biggest drop in nearly two years, shedding 4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The benchmark index is now down more than 18% from the record high it reached at the beginning of the year. That’s just shy of the 20% decline that’s considered a bear market. “The sentiment in the market is highly negative as traders and investors are largely concerned about an economic downturn and soaring inflation,” Naeem Aslam of Avatrade said. Rising interest rates, high inflation, the war in Ukraine and a slowdown in China’s economy have caused investors to reconsider the prices they’re willing to pay for a wide range of stocks, from high-flying tech companies to traditional automakers. The last bear market happened just two years ago, but this would still be a first for those investors that got their start trading on their phones during the pandemic. For years, thanks in large part to extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve, stocks often seemed to go in only one direction: up. Now, the familiar rallying cry to “buy the dip” after every market wobble is giving way to fear that the dip is turning into a crater. The Federal Reserve is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. Many other central banks are on a similar track. But the Bank of Japan has stuck to its low interest rate policy and the gap between those benchmark rates of the world’s largest and third-largest economies has pushed the dollar’s value up against the Japanese yen. Japan reported a trade deficit for April as its imports ballooned 28%. The shift reflects surging energy costs amid the war in Ukraine and a weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo lost 1.9% to 26,402.84 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.5% to 20,120.60. In South Korea, the Kospi shed 1.3% to 2,592.34, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gave up 1.7% to 7,064.50. The Shanghai Composite index reversed earlier losses, gaining 0.4% to 3.096.96. On Wednesday, retailer Target lost a quarter of its value after reporting earnings that fell far short of analysts’ forecasts. Inflation, especially for shipping costs, dragged its operating margin for the first quarter to 5.3%. It had been expecting 8% or higher. The company warned that its costs for freight this year would be $1 billion higher than it estimated just three months ago. The report comes a day after Walmart said its profit took a hit from higher costs. The nation’s largest retailer fell 6.8%, adding to its losses from Tuesday. Target and Walmart each provided anecdotal evidence that inflation is weighing on consumers, saying they held back on purchasing big-ticket items and changed from national brands to less expensive store brands. The weak reports stoked concerns that stubbornly rising inflation is putting a tighter squeeze on a wide range of businesses and could cut deeper into their profits. Other big retailers also have racked up hefty losses. The data are not entirely consistent. On Tuesday, the market cheered an encouraging report from the Commerce Department that showed retail sales rose in April, driven by higher sales of cars, electronics, and more spending at restaurants. Investors worry the Fed could trigger a recession if it raises interest rates too high or too quickly. Worries persist about global growth as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem COVID-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil declined $1.27 to $108.32 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It dropped $2.81 to $109.59 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the basis for pricing for international trading, slipped 71 cents to $108.40 per barrel. The dollar fell to 127.92 Japanese yen from 128.20 yen late Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.0514 from $1.0464."
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Elon Musk: Doubt About Spam Accounts Could Scuttle Twitter Deal,business," LONDON (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter can’t move forward unless the company shows public proof that less than 5% of the accounts on the platform are fake or spam. Musk made the comment in a reply to another user on Twitter early Tuesday. He spent much of the previous day in a back-and-forth with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who posted a series of tweets explaining his company’s effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5% of Twitter accounts are fake. In his tweet Tuesday, Musk said: “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.This deal cannot move forward until he does. He added that: “Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of 5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does.” At a Miami technology conference Monday, Musk estimated that at least 20% of Twitter’s 229 million accounts are spam bots, a percentage he said was at the low end of his assessment, according to a Bloomberg News report. Also at the All In Summit, Musk gave the strongest hint yet that he would like to pay less for Twitter than his $44 billion offer made last month. He said a viable deal at a lower price would not be out of the question, according to the report by Bloomberg, which said it viewed a livestream video of the conference posted by a Twitter user."
11,"After Helping Depress Twitter Stock, Elon Musk Floats Possibility Of Lower Purchase Price",business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost After bad-mouthing Twitter last week and helping send stock prices — and company value — down, Elon Musk said Monday that a lower purchase price for Twitter is “not out of the question.” But he still didn’t appear very enthusiastic about buying the social media giant, even with a reduced price. Musk reached a deal last month to buy Twitter for $44 billion but has recently been grumbling about the company, which has hurt its value. He put the deal on “hold” last Friday after speculating that bots and spam may make up more than the company’s claim of less than 5% of the operation’s accounts. The criticism, and Musk’s apparent balkiness about the deal, sent Twitter stocks down that day as much as 25% — a convenient situation for someone seeking a purchase deal. The Tesla CEO mocked Twitter account figures in a remote interview at the All-Summit tech conference in Miami on Monday, quipping that the number of bots is “as unknowable as the human soul, basically.” He called it “beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that ... the number of real, unique humans [on the social media platform] is above 95%.” He smirked: “There’s a bridge I’d like to sell ya.” He estimated, based on his theory about ratios of popular tweets to number of users, that spam and bots make up at least 20% of Twitter accounts. But Musk also speculated that bots could constitute “potentially 80% or 90%” of accounts, which is critical to know for advertising, he noted. In response to a question, he said that reducing the purchase price wouldn’t be “out of the question” in light of the bot concerns, but he didn’t appear enthusiastic even in that case. “The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow. At the end of the day, it has to be fixable.” “It really depends on a lot of factors here,” he said. “I’m still waiting for some sort of logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on Twitter. And Twitter is refusing to tell us. This seems like a strange thing.” He also accused Twitter of having a “far left bias.” (Check out his full remarks below:) Also Monday, Musk responded with a poop emoji when Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal explained in a detailed Twitter thread about how the company ascertains fake users. I don’t want to make too much of a literal shitpost but what the hell is going on with this cursed acquisition pic.twitter.com/q5ewRgFOCR Twitter shares fell 8.2% at the close of trading Monday in New York, Bloomberg reported. Twitter has declined to comment on Musk’s latest remarks. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine last week raised concerns about market manipulation and securities fraud in the Twitter purchase in light of Musk’s very public criticisms on his massive social media platform of a company he agreed to buy. When buying a company, “you are not supposed to say things that aren’t true and that will affect the stock of a public company that you are trying to buy,” Levine noted. “That is what is usually called ‘securities fraud,’ or what I sometimes like to call ‘lite securities fraud.’ Musk has a long history of lite securities fraud.” Musk settled a fraud lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 because he tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private but hadn’t. He tried in vain to wriggle out of the settlement last month. He’s currently being sued for securities fraud by Twitter shareholders because he missed the legally required deadline by 10 days to declare that his stake in the company had risen to 5%. By keeping that information hidden, he was able to continue to buy stock without an uptick in prices triggered by his interest, saving $143 million, according to the suit. The SEC is now also looking into that, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Former SEC Chair Harvey Pitt told Yahoo Finance on Monday that Musk can walk away from the Twitter deal, though it will cost him at least $1 billion as spelled out in the contract. In addition, he would “probably be sued left and right by shareholders if he does that.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
12,Sony PlayStation Staff Outraged Over CEO’s Abortion Rights Stance In Email About Cats,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost The CEO of PlayStation is under fire. Employees at Sony Group Corporation say they are outraged over an email that the head of PlayStation sent days after a leaked draft indicated that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, Bloomberg first reported. PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan sent an email to employees on Thursday in which he remained neutral about his stance on abortion rights and encouraged others to “respect differences of opinion” — before launching into five ill-timed paragraphs about his two cat celebrating their birthdays. “We owe it to each other and to PlayStation’s millions of users to respect differences of opinion among everyone in our internal and external communities,” he wrote. “Respect does not equal agreement. But it is fundamental to who we are as a company and as a valued global brand.” Ryan then suddenly switched topics, diving into a story about his two cats celebrating their first birthdays and telling his employees he “would like to share something lighthearted to help inspire everyone to be mindful of having balance that can help ease the stress of uncertain world events.” Gushing over his furry friends, Ryan boasted about getting birthday cakes for his cats, talked about their habits and revealed his dreams of owning a dog one day. Jim Ryan's email, seen by Bloomberg News, does not take a stance on Roe v. Wade or abortion rights but does declare ""that dogs really are man’s best friend, they know their place, and perform useful functions like biting burglars and chasing balls that you throw for them."" Employees at multiple PlayStation studios expressed being put off by the tone of the email, according to internal company discussions viewed and reported on by Bloomberg. Some female employees said they felt disrespected by the message. One employee said they’d “never been so mad about a cat birthday before.” One employee tweeted that he had responded to Ryan’s email to say the company “could be doing a better job.” Games are community driven. Game devs are responsible for enforcing inclusive and humane values in their communities. ✅PlayStation could be doing a better job. Many of us at SMS responded to an email about the Roe v Wade decision by corporate leadership. Here's my response: pic.twitter.com/rRwIY30Due Other Twitter users have also condemned Ryan’s email. And it's easy to understand why PlayStation devs are pissed. Abortion is not something up for debate, especially when 99% of the time it's just men trying to impose their vision on what a woman should do of her body and life. Not taking a clear stance on such topics is dangerous. https://t.co/WevgRTppg9 The netflix anti-woke memo and the playstation it's-ok-to-oppose-abortion email should be taken as harbingers of a possible near-future in which mass market entertainment doesn't merely launder fascist ideas, but outright endorses them Though PlayStation hasn’t taken public a stance on abortion rights, other companies in the video game industry have. Notably, Bungie Inc., the developer of the Destiny game and a company that Sony agreed to buy earlier this year for $3.6 billion, blasted the leaked Supreme Court draft as “a direct attack on human rights” in a blog post last week. “Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make,” Bungie said in the post. Some have praised Bungie’s concrete stance on abortion rights. Well, I'm suddenly even more proud of the statement Bungie's leadership put out on abortion and reproductive health rights. I do not play #Destiny but I am about to buy a shirt from @Bungie because they support abortion right so any suggestions? Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Elon Musk's 'Hold' On Twitter Deal Triggers Securities Fraud Concerns,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk’s announcement that his deal to buy Twitter was “temporarily on hold,” driving down the stock prices — and value — of the company he made a deal to buy, is triggering concerns about possible securities fraud. He insisted hours later he was “still committed to the acquisition.” With his enormous platform on Twitter, Musk can rattle the stock market with a single sentence. His tweet Friday that his $44 billion commitment to buy Twitter was “temporarily on hold” because there may be more fake accounts and bots on Twitter than he realized sent Twitter stock down as much as 25%. Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn Musk himself decided to forego due diligence before his offer. Had he not done so, he could have thoroughly investigated the company. Friday night he said in a tweet that his “team” would do a study of 100 randomly chosen Twitter profiles to try to confirm they were authentic and asked other users to do the same. But it was past time for due diligence under the terms of his deal. “‘Temporarily on hold’ is not a thing,” Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine wrote Friday. “Elon Musk has signed a binding contract requiring him to buy Twitter.” The contract “does not allow Musk to walk away if it turns out that ‘spam/fake accounts’ represent more than 5% of Twitter users,” which was revealed by the company in its quarterly filings last month, Levine added. When buying a company “you are not supposed to say things that aren’t true and that will affect the stock of a public company that you are trying to buy,” Levine noted. “That is what is usually called ‘securities fraud,’ or what I sometimes like to call ’lite securities fraud.’ Musk has a long history of lite securities fraud.” Musk settled a fraud lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 because he tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private but hadn’t.

By keeping that information hidden, he was able to continue to buy stock without an uptick in prices triggered by his interest, saving $143 million, according to the suit. The SEC is now also looking into that, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal was working to steady the boat Friday and calm investor fears in the wake of Musk’s tweet. “While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter,” he tweeted. While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter. I’m accountable for leading and operating Twitter, and our job is to build a stronger Twitter every day. Musk could not immediately be reached for comment. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
14,Crypto Crash Leaves Trading Platform Coinbase Slumped,business," SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has lost half its value in the past week, including its biggest one-day drop to date on Wednesday as the famously volatile crypto market weathers yet another slump. Coinbase reported a $430 million net loss in the first quarter, or $1.98 per share, on declining sales and active users. Analysts were expecting profit of 8 cents per share. Revenue was down as trading volumes fell, and active monthly users declined 19% from the fourth quarter. It’s unlikely those results surprised investors — shares Coinbase Global Inc. declined 43% in the four days leading up to their earnings release Tuesday. On Wednesday, shares fell 26%, to $53.72 per share. On the day of its initial public offering just 13 months ago, prices hit $429 per share. Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst who covers Coinbase for Raymond James, acknowledged in a note to clients that there was an ongoing debate over whether the crypto market was in one of its typical funks or if this was the post-pandemic bubble deflating. “While management strongly believes the former will prove to be true, we suspect there is more than a bit of truth to the latter, particularly with crypto failing to serve as an inflation hedge thus far in 2022,” O’Shaughnessy wrote. Like much of Wall Street, O’Shaughnessy said his firm expects Coinbase to continue to lose money in the coming quarters, and that the “cons of increased crypto regulation down the road will decidedly outweigh the pros.” Government officials have made it clear that regulation is coming. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in April that more government oversight is needed in the fledgling industry and that over the next six months, Treasury would work with the White House and other agencies to develop reports and recommendations on digital currencies. “Our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks – especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy,” Yellen said. On Tuesday, Yellen testified to the Senate Banking Committee, warning legislators about stablecoins, which are digital currencies usually pegged to the dollar or a commodity such as gold. In theory, stablecoins are better-suited to commercial transactions than other cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate in value. Stablecoins essentially promise investors that they can be redeemed for a dollar. However, a recent run on the TerraUSD stablecoin dropped its value to as low as 30 cents, sowing doubt among investors about the safety of stablecoins. Terra recovered somewhat, to about 68 cents on Wednesday. “The outstanding stock of stablecoins is growing at a very rapid rate and we really need a consistent federal framework,” Yellen told the committee, adding that legislation on stablecoins could be crafted by 2023. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on digital assets in March that urged the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should create its own digital currency. Biden’s order also directed federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security. In a letter to shareholders, Coinbase said it believed that current market conditions were not permanent and it remained focused on the long-term while prioritizing product development."
15,"Starbucks Broke Law By Firing And Threatening Pro-Union Workers, Labor Board Alleges",business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Starbucks committed a host of labor law violations by terminating six pro-union workers, disciplining and surveilling others, closing stores and changing work policies in the course of its battle with an organizing campaign, according to a complaint filed by labor officials on Friday. A regional director for the National Labor Relations Board brought the charges against the Seattle-based coffee chain, having found merit in allegations made by the union Workers United. The union has successfully organized more than 50 Starbucks stores since last year despite an aggressive counter-campaign by the company. The complaint filed Friday was unusually wide-ranging, alleging a pattern of intimidation and retaliation at several stores in New York. It also implicated CEO Howard Schultz, alleging he violated the law last November by promising “an increase in benefits” if they didn’t unionize. The regional director, Linda Leslie, asked that either Schultz or executive Rossann Williams read a notice to workers explaining what their rights are, or be present with board agents who read read such a notice. Linda said a video should be recorded so that it could be distributed to all stores. The complaint says Starbucks shuttered stores with the intent to intimidate workers seeking a union, punished workers who supported the organizing effort, deployed managers to surveil union sympathizers and granted benefits to try to turn workers against the union. Board officials file such a complaint after they’ve investigated a union’s claims and found them to be credible. The union campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, said the complaint “fully unmasks Starbucks’ facade as a ‘progressive company.’” “Starbucks has been saying that no union-busting ever occurred in Buffalo. Today, the NLRB sets the record straight,” the campaign said in a statement Friday. “The complaint confirms the extent and depravity of Starbucks’ conduct in Western New York for the better part of a year. Starbucks will be held accountable for the union-busting minefield they forced workers to walk through in fighting for their right to organize.” A Starbucks spokesperson said in an email that the company does not believe the allegations have merit, calling the complaint “the beginning of a litigation process that permits both sides to be heard.” “We believe the allegations contained in the complaint are false, and we look forward to presenting our evidence when the allegations are adjudicated,” the spokesperson said. Many of the alleged actions occurred in Starbucks stores in the Buffalo area, where the organizing campaign began in 2021. The effort has since spread throughout the country, with more than 200 stores petitioning for union elections. In the complaint, Leslie said Starbucks should have to provide managers with training on workers rights, and provide the union with “equal time” to make its case to workers if the company holds anti-union meetings. She also said the fired workers should be offered reinstatement and backpay. Without a settlement between the board and Starbucks, the case could go to trial, with witnesses from both sides providing testimony. The charges are part of a broader legal fight between Starbucks and Workers United, with the campaign accusing the company of retaliating against organizers. The union has urged board officials to pursue cases against Starbucks, arguing that the company’s actions will have a chilling effect on workers who would otherwise assert their rights. Labor board officials have previously found merit in some of the union’s claims. A different regional director recently filed charges against Starbucks for terminating a group of Tennessee workers known as the Memphis Seven. In another case, the labor board’s general counsel went to federal court seeking a temporary injunction to have three Starbucks workers put back on the job. The general counsel accused Starbucks of targeting the workers for their union support. This story has been updated with comment from Starbucks.

0,"US Added 428,000 Jobs In April Despite Surging Inflation",business," WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers added 428,000 jobs in April, extending a streak of solid hiring that has defied punishing inflation, chronic supply shortages, the Russian war against Ukraine and much higher borrowing costs. Friday’s jobs report from the Labor Department showed that last month’s hiring kept the unemployment rate at 3.6%, just above the lowest level in a half-century. The economy’s hiring gains have been remarkably consistent in the face of the worst inflation in four decades. Employers have added at least 400,000 jobs for 12 straight months. Yet it’s unclear how long the jobs boom will continue. The Federal Reserve this week raised its key rate by a half-percentage point — its most aggressive move since 2000 — and signaled further large rate hikes to come. As the Fed’s rate hikes take effect, they will make it increasingly expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, spend and hire. In addition, the vast economic aid that the government had been supplying to households has expired. And Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped accelerate inflation and clouded the economic outlook. Some economists warn of a growing risk of recession. For now, the resilience of the job market is particularly striking when set against the backdrop of galloping price increases and rising borrowing costs. This week, the Labor Department provided further evidence that the job market is still booming. It reported that only 1.38 million Americans were collecting traditional unemployment benefits, the fewest since 1970. And it said that employers posted a record-high 11.5 million job openings in March and that layoffs remained well below pre-pandemic levels. What’s more, the economy now has, on average, two available jobs for every unemployed person. That’s the highest such proportion on record. And in yet another sign that workers are enjoying unusual leverage in the job market, a record 4.5 million people quit their jobs in March, evidently confident that they could find a better opportunity elsewhere. Chronic shortages of goods, supplies and workers have contributed to skyrocketing price increases — the highest inflation rate in 40 years. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February dramatically worsened the financial landscape, sending global oil and gas prices skyward and severely clouding the national and global economic picture. In the meantime, with many industries slowed by worker shortages, companies have been jacking up pay to try to attract job applicants and retain their existing employees. Even so, pay raises haven’t kept pace with the spike in consumer prices. That’s why the Fed, which most economists say was much too slow to recognize the inflation threat, is now raising rates aggressively. Its goal is a notoriously difficult one: a so-called soft landing."
1,The Fed Issued Its Biggest Rate Hike In 22 Years. Here's How That Will Affect Your Finances,business," WASHINGTON (AP) — Record-low mortgages below 3% are long gone. Credit card rates will likely rise. So will the cost of an auto loan. Savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation. The substantial half-point hike in its benchmark short-term rate that the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday won’t, by itself, have much immediate effect on most Americans’ finances. But additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the Fed’s next two meetings, in June and July, and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989. The result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the Fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades-long era of historically low rates. Chair Jerome Powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive, the Fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes, cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation. Yet the risks are high. With inflation likely to stay elevated, the Fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects. Doing so could tip the U.S. economy into recession. Here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses: ___ Rates on home loans have soared in the past few months, mostly in anticipation of the Fed’s moves, and will probably keep rising. Mortgage rates don’t necessarily move up in tandem with the Fed’s rate increases. Sometimes, they even move in the opposite direction. Long-term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is influenced by a variety of factors. These include investors’ expectations for future inflation and global demand for U.S. Treasurys. For now, though, faster inflation and strong U.S. economic growth are sending the 10-year Treasury rate up sharply. As a consequence, mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began, to 5.1% on average for a 30-year fixed mortgage, according to Freddie Mac. In part, the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the Fed will keep raising its key rate. But its forthcoming hikes aren’t likely fully priced in yet. If the Fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3.5% by mid-2023, as many economists expect, the 10-year Treasury yield will go much higher, too, and mortgages will become more expensive. If you’re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses, which has triggered bidding wars and eye-watering prices, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. Economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would-be purchasers. And average home prices, which have been soaring at about a 20% annual rate, could at least rise at a slower pace. The surge in mortgage rates “will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would-be homebuyers are priced out,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. Still, the number of available homes remains historically low, a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high. Fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive. But other factors also affect these rates, including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs. Rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the Fed’s hikes, said Alex Yurchenko, chief data officer for Black Book, which monitors U.S. vehicle prices. Because used vehicle prices, on average, are rising, monthly payments will rise too. For now, new-vehicle loans average about 4.5%. Used-vehicle rates are about 5%. For users of credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other variable-interest debt, rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the Fed hike, usually within one or two billing cycles. That’s because those rates are based in part on banks’ prime rate, which moves in tandem with the Fed. Those who don’t qualify for low-rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances. The rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does. Should the Fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years — a distinct possibility — that would significantly enlarge interest payments. Probably, though not likely by very much. And it depends on where your savings, if you have any, are parked. Savings, certificates of deposit and money market accounts don’t typically track the Fed’s changes. Instead, banks tend to capitalize on a higher-rate environment to try to increase their profits. They do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers. This is particularly true for large banks now. They’ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier Americans during the pandemic. They won’t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or CD buyers. But online banks and others with high-yield savings accounts could be an exception. These accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors. The only catch is that they typically require significant deposits. Still, savers are starting to see some better potential returns from Treasurys. On Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year note was 2.96%, after having briefly topped 3% for the first time since 2018. Financial markets expect inflation to average 2.83% over 10 years. That level would give investors a positive, if very small, return of about 0.13%. “All of a sudden, we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before,” said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for Private Wealth at Glenmede. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report."
2,LinkedIn Settles With U.S. Over Alleged Pay Discrimination,business," SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The career-networking service LinkedIn has agreed to pay $1.8 million in back wages to hundreds of female workers to settle a pay discrimination complaint brought by U.S. labor investigators. The U.S. Labor Department announced Tuesday that it has reached a settlement agreement with LinkedIn to resolve allegations of “systemic, gender-based pay discrimination” in which women were paid less than men in comparable job roles. The settlement affects nearly 700 women who worked in engineering, product or marketing roles from 2015 to 2017 at the company’s offices in San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California. It includes the time before and after Microsoft’s $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016. LinkedIn said in a statement that “while we have agreed to settle this matter, we do not agree with the government’s claims; LinkedIn pays and has paid its employees fairly and equitably when comparing similar work.”"
3,Starbucks Workers Have Unionized More Than 50 Stores In The U.S.,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The effort to organize Starbucks hit a milestone on Tuesday: More than 50 stores have now unionized, with many more likely on the way. So far the campaign known as Starbucks Workers United has won the vast majority of union elections that have been held. As of noon, the union was victorious in 46 out of 54 contests, or 85% of them, according to data from the National Labor Relations Board. The union had lost only five elections, and the results were still not clear in another three. Starbucks Workers United surpassed the 50-store mark later in the day, after winning four consecutive ballot counts for stores in Massachusetts. The labor board still has not certified the results in some elections, and the company may choose to challenge them. None of Starbucks’ roughly 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores had union membership until last year, when Starbucks Workers United began organizing in the Buffalo, N.Y., area and quickly spread to other regions. The campaign is part of the union Workers United, an affiliate of the 2-million-member Service Employees International Union. The campaign shared the news on Twitter to celebrate what seemed all but impossible just a year ago. The Mt. Auburn store in Watertown, MA just became the 50th Starbucks store to unionize nationwide!!! At this rate, the union is likely to organize over a hundred stores and perhaps many more, judging from how many elections workers have requested. As of Tuesday, the union had petitioned for votes at 237 stores, the labor board said. Votes have already been scheduled for 118 of them in the coming weeks. Workers can petition for an election once 30% or more in a workplace have signed union authorization cards. When an election is held, the union needs to secure a simple majority of votes cast in order to win and become the workers’ bargaining representative. But Starbucks Workers United appears to be rounding up a supermajority of support inside many stores, judging from their success rate. Several of their election victories have been shutouts in which not a single worker voted against the union. And while many victories have been blowouts, the handful of losses for the union have tended to be close, like its narrow 8-7 defeat at a Hawaii store on Monday. Starbucks has aggressively combated the union campaign. The company has tried to slow the pace of union elections through the labor board and dispatched managers, right on up to CEO Howard Schultz, to urge workers to vote against unionization. Starbucks recently filed charges with the board accusing the union of harassing employees and customers. The union has filed a litany of its own charges against Starbucks, alleging that the company has illegally retaliated against pro-union workers to stifle the organizing campaign. Board officials have found merit in some of those claims. A regional director for the NLRB has filed a complaint against Starbucks over a group of Tennessee workers whom Starbucks fired in February, known as the Memphis Seven, accusing the company of targeting them for their union activism. In a separate case, another regional director sought an injunction in federal court to get three Starbucks workers back on the job, saying the company retaliated against them. Starbucks maintains that it hasn’t targeted anyone for union organizing, saying all the workers who were fired or disciplined had violated company policy. The Starbucks union campaign is one of the most closely watched in decades. The group still represents only a small fraction of Starbucks’ overall workforce of more than 200,000, but the inroads it has made into a powerful and previously union-free company has given the labor movement a burst of optimism at a time of low union membership. So has the recent success of the new Amazon Labor Union, which won a historic election at an 8,000-worker fulfillment center on Staten Island held in March. That vote created the tech giant’s first organized facility in the U.S. On Monday, the Amazon Labor Union lost a vote at a second, smaller facility on Staten Island, but union leaders have predicted that more Amazon elections are to come.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Amazon Union Loses Election At Staten Island Warehouse,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost After recently forming the first union at an Amazon warehouse in the U.S., the new Amazon Labor Union suffered a setback Monday by losing an election at a different facility on Staten Island. In a ballot count held by the National Labor Relations Board, workers at the Amazon sorting facility known as LDJ5 rejected unionizing by a count of 618-380. The labor board has not yet certified the results to make them official, and the union may challenge them. The Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8, which employs 8,000 people, was the first Amazon facility in the U.S. to unionize, when workers voted 2,654 to 2,131 in favor of forming a union in late March. The smaller LDJ5 facility employs about 1,500 workers. Had they delivered another victory for the Amazon Labor Union, it could have added fuel to one of the most closely watched organizing campaigns in generations. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement the company was “glad” that workers were able to “have their voices heard.” “We look forward to continuing to work directly together as we strive to make every day better for our employees,” Nantel said. Seth Goldstein, a lawyer who’s been advising the Amazon Labor Union, told HuffPost the union was “evaluating our options” as it relates to challenging the election results based on Amazon’s conduct. It would have until May 9 to do so. Goldstein said the results were not a major setback, and predicted there would be more elections to come. “They’re going to win and they’re going to lose,” he said of pro-union workers. “It’s not going to stop the organizing.” Amazon has aggressively fought union efforts at all its warehouses. The company deployed managers and outside anti-union consultants to hold group meetings and one-on-one conversations with workers, urging them to vote against the union. The company spent roughly $4.3 million on such consultants last year. The union has accused Amazon of breaking labor law by retaliating against pro-union workers and making threats. The NLRB’s general counsel has found merit in some of the union’s allegations. The union may file a challenge to the results at LDJ5, alleging Amazon illegally swayed the vote. Labor board officials found that Amazon had done so during a different union election in Alabama last year, ordering a do-over vote that was conducted there in March. The results in that election are still unclear due to ballots that have been challenged. Amazon has accused the Amazon Labor Union of interfering in the vote at JFK8, asking the labor board to set aside the union’s victory there. The labor board still needs to investigate Amazon’s claims related to that election. The new Amazon Labor Union was co-founded by Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee whom the company fired after he led a walkout over safety concerns early in the pandemic. Smalls and his fellow organizers built a strong committee inside the JFK8 warehouse to combat Amazon’s anti-union message and embolden pro-union coworkers. Following the vote count Monday, Smalls took to Twitter and told supporters not to be discouraged with the results at LDJ5. He said it was a harder facility to organize than the warehouse where the union had won: Despite todays outcome I’m proud of the worker/organizers of LDJ5 they had a tougher challenge after our victory at JFK8.Our leads should be extremely proud to have given their coworkers a right to join a Union @amazonlabor will continue to organize and so should all of you The election win at JFK8 shocked the labor movement because the Amazon Labor Union did not exist until last year and generally doesn’t have the resources of an established union. Along with the organizing success at Starbucks, the union’s earlier win has helped kindle hopes of a labor resurgence after decades of declining union membership rates. Right now just 1 in 10 workers belongs to a union, compared with double that rate in the early 1980s. Union density is particularly low in the private sector, where just 6.1% of workers are union members. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
11,McDonald's Left With Millions Of Dollars Of Russian Food It Can't Use. Here’s Why.,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost McDonald’s is in a pickle. The fast-food titan announced last month that it would temporarily close its nearly 850 locations in Russia due the country’s invasion of Ukraine. McDonald’s also pulled the plug on its restaurants in Ukraine, which cost the chain $127 million last quarter, according to CNN. Last month, McDonald’s said in a statement that it would continue to pay full salaries to all Ukrainian and Russian employees. The company also donated $5 million to its Employee Assistance Fund. Maintaining staff costs, alongside payments for leases and supplies, cost the company $27 million. The other whopping $100 million deficit stemmed from food and other unused items that now must be nixed. “Results included ... $100 million of costs for inventory in the company’s supply chain that likely will be disposed of due to restaurants being temporarily closed,” the fast-food powerhouse said in a statement. Keeping a spirit of optimism for the company’s recovery, CFO Kevin Ozan said: ​​“We expect this to be temporary and we certainly don’t take this decision lightly, but for us this is about doing what we think is the right thing to do, both for the global business and for our people locally.” At this time no further updates have been issued on the company’s plans for its locations in Ukraine and Russia. “As we move forward, McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture, it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia.” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
12,OSHA Tells Amazon To Improve Severe Weather Safety Following Warehouse Collapse,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Workplace safety officials have ordered Amazon to review its severe weather policies and take new precautions after six workers died in an Illinois warehouse collapse. The letter issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Tuesday outlined some problems with Amazon’s handling of a direct tornado hit in Edwardsville in December. The megaphone that would be used to alert workers to severe weather was locked and inaccessible, and some workers told OSHA investigators they had never been told where to shelter in place in such a situation. But officials said Amazon had met “minimal federal safety guidelines” for severe weather and chose not to fine the tech giant over the deaths. All six workers who died worked for outside contractors who handle Amazon deliveries. A seventh worker was severely injured. “Amazon and all employers should go above minimum requirements,” Doug Parker, the head of OSHA, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. “Employers need to have a plan that protects all workers and all people on the property whenever disaster strikes.” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the tornado was “extreme and very sudden,” and that “our team did the right thing, moving people to shelter as soon as the warning was issued.” “OSHA’s investigation did not find any violations or causes for citations, but we’re constantly looking to innovate and improve our safety measures and have already begun conducting additional safety and emergency preparedness drills,” Nantel said. According to the “hazard alert” letter sent to Amazon, managers started telling workers to head to the restroom for shelter about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The designated shelter-in-place location was a restroom in the northern part of the building, but 10 workers, including five of those who died, ended up in a bathroom at the facility’s south end, near a loading dock. “Amazon and all employers should go above minimum requirements.” Aaron Priddy, an area director for OSHA, said the tornado struck right near this area of the warehouse, taking off the roof and collapsing the western wall. Priddy said investigators couldn’t determine for sure why workers ended up there — because they were told to get to a bathroom (in this case, the wrong one), or because it was the most logical place to go near a loading dock without other structured rooms. “We know there was confusion about exactly where to report,” said Priddy, who authored the letter to Amazon. “It just really critically highlights that importance of pre-planning.” Priddy wrote that Amazon’s emergency response plan was not tailored to weather events likely to hit Edwardsville. Rather than being “customized with specific instructions,” the plan was generalized and included scenarios unlikely to play out in the area, like a hurricane. Amazon’s plan noted evacuation routes for the warehouse but did not identify the shelter-in-place area. But Priddy also said it was not appropriate to issue a citation against Amazon. OSHA doesn’t have a safety standard for severe weather in particular but could fine a company under what’s known as the “general duty” clause, which broadly states the employers have an obligation to keep workers safe from harm. Amazon responded “the way we would expect any employer to,” Priddy said. “But we did identify several opportunities in which Amazon could improve their severe weather response plan.” OSHA officials said Amazon needs to make sure everyone, including contractors, takes part in severe weather drills and knows where to shelter in place. They also said Amazon should create written plans with site-specific guidelines for events like tornadoes, and not just fires. This story has been updated with comment from Amazon.

13,Jeff Bezos Questions China's Leverage Over Elon Musk After Twitter Sale,business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Jeff Bezos, the executive chairman of Amazon, implied Monday that fellow multibillionaire Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter could give China leverage over the platform. Bezos shared a tweet saying that China makes up the second-biggest market for Tesla, arguing it raises an “interesting question.” Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square? https://t.co/jTiEnabP6T “Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?” Bezos wrote. China has a record of media censorship and “is one of the world’s most restrictive media environments,” according to the Council of Foreign Relations. Case in point: Twitter has been banned in the country since 2009. Musk has previously referred to the social media platform as the “as the de facto public town square.” Bezos eventually answered his own question with “probably not,” saying Musk’s purchase would prove more challenging for Tesla than the social media company. “But we’ll see,” he said. “Musk is extremely good at navigating this kind of complexity.” Amazon is no stranger to navigating complexities in order to take advantage of the Chinese market. According to Reuters, Amazon removed the ratings and comment sections from its Chinese website after a book including speeches by Chinese President Xi Jinping received a negative review. Amazon also had to work together “with an arm of China’s propaganda apparatus” to launch a China Books section on the American website, including a book praising life in Xinjiang, where China is accused of forcibly detaining 1 million of its own citizens, according to the Reuters report. Musk and Bezos have a longstanding feud that includes a rivalry between their two space exploration companies, Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’ Blue Origin. “Jeff who?” Musk answered, when asked about the rivalry between the two companies in September, according to The New York Times. In April 2021, SpaceX won a $2.9 billion NASA contract to develop a rocket to take astronauts to the moon, beating Bezos’s Blue Origin, according to The Washington Post. Twitter’s board of directors announced Monday it agreed to sell the company to Musk for around $44 billion. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” Dorsey started a Twitter thread reacting to Musk’s deal to buy Twitter and take it private, sharing the Radiohead song “Everything Is In Its Right Place.” Dorsey, who now heads digital payments company Block, formerly known as Square, pledged to help protect Twitter. “Twitter as a company has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret,” he wrote. “It has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model. Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step.” He also thanked Musk and current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal for “getting the company out of an impossible situation.” Musk and Dorsey appear to be on friendly terms. On April 5, before Musk decided against joining Twitter’s board, Dorsey tweeted he was “happy” to welcome Musk as a director. “He cares deeply about our world and Twitter’s role in it,” Dorsey tweeted. “Parag and Elon both lead with their hearts, and they will be an incredible team.” I’m really happy Elon is joining the Twitter board! He cares deeply about our world and Twitter’s role in it.Parag and Elon both lead with their hearts, and they will be an incredible team. https://t.co/T4rWEJFAes In February 2019, Dorsey told tech columnist Kara Swisher — in an interview via tweet — that Musk was the most exciting person on Twitter at the time. “I like how @elonmusk uses Twitter,” Dorsey said. “He’s focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot, and all the ups and downs that come with it.” To me personally? I like how @elonmusk uses Twitter. He’s focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly.

Agrawal made no mention of Musk in his tweet commenting on the deal, choosing to instead praise Twitter employees. “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” Agrawal wrote. In an all-hands meeting of Twitter employees that followed the announcement, Agrawal acknowledged a period of uncertainty. “Between now and closing ... we will continue making decisions as we’ve always had, guided by the principles we’ve had,” Agrawal said, according to a recording of the call obtained by CNN. “That doesn’t mean things won’t change, things have been changing.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

He plans to add in new features, change algorithms and get rid of spam bots on the social media platform. Musk and Twitter’s board were close to a deal after a meeting on Sunday, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk, who already owned about 9% of Twitter’s shares, said he had secured $46.5 billion to finalize the purchase. The reported agreement follows Musk’s April 14 offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, or about $44 billion, to take the company private. “My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,” Musk said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.” Before the deal, Twitter’s shares had been trading well below Musk’s offer price, suggesting investors had little confidence an agreement would be reached. At a TED event in Vancouver later the day Musk made his offer, the billionaire acknowledged uncertainty he’d pull off a deal, but said he was pursuing Twitter because he believes “it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech.” ""I think it's very important for that to be an inclusive arena for free speech...

The day after Musk’s offer, Twitter’s board rejected it and said it would adopt a “poison pill” anti-takeover defense. This “does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders,” the company added in a statement. Musk in the past has stirred trouble for himself on Twitter. In 2018, he tweeted that he had enough money to take Tesla private, but a court later ruled his claim was false and misleading. At the Vancouver TED event, Musk revisited the controversy. “I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards,” Musk said of regulators, according to Reuters. Following Musk’s 2018 tweets, Tesla stockholders asked U.S. District Judge Edward Chen to stop the CEO’s “public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative.” Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. The SEC charged Musk with securities fraud over those tweets. Musk settled for $40 million, half of it paid by Tesla. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chair for three years and promised he’d allow the company to preview statements about the company. This is a developing story.

0,"Elon Musk, Twitter Reportedly In Purchase Talks",business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Twitter’s board is in talks to sell the company to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and could settle on a deal as soon as Monday, Reuters reported. The two sides met Sunday — just 10 days after Musk offered $43 billion ($54.20 a share) for the social media platform, according to Wall Street Journal sources. Musk had said this was his “best and final” offer. The New York Times reported that the talks between Musk and Twitter’s 11-member board went into the early hours Monday, and that the two sides appeared to be “nearing a deal,” though it could still fall apart. They were discussing finer details, including scheduling and fees to be paid if a signed agreement fell apart. Twitter on Monday appeared set to accept Musk’s offer of $54.20 a share, Reuters reported, citing sources. The company may announce a deal later in the day, after its board has met, according to the wire service. Twitter had been chilly about the offer, but then Musk revealed Thursday that he had amassed $46.5 billion in financing to buy the company. The offer to take the company private by the often-unpredictable entrepreneur rattled Twitter fans fearful that Musk’s anything-goes mission could destroy what has become a kind of moderately civilized mass town square. And stockholders have been skeptical that Musk would actually get the money and his proposal together. Musk pushed hard for the deal on Friday when he met privately via video calls with several key shareholders to pitch his purchase, according to the Journal. He vowed to solve the “free speech” issues he’s convinced are hurting the platform. Few details of his plan were immediately available, but he has tweeted about reducing advertising and allowing longer tweets. Some shareholders praised Musk after the meetings. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC, told the Journal. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Thrivent holds a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million. It’s also a Tesla shareholder. Musk has said he was considering taking his bid directly to shareholders with a tender offer. But even with major shareholder support he would need a strategy around the company’s so-called “poison pill,” a maneuver that would effectively block him from building his stake to 15% or more. Twitter’s shares have generally been trading below his offer price since he made the bid on April 14, typically a sign shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen. But they were up 4% on Friday, noted the Journal. Twitter is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings Thursday. Liza Hearon contributed reporting. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Federal Officials Sue Starbucks To Reinstate Fired Union Activists,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Officials with the National Labor Relations Board have gone to federal court in an effort to get three Starbucks workers who are union activists back on the job. A regional director for the board in Arizona filed a petition for a temporary injunction on Friday, saying Starbucks retaliated against three members of a union organizing committee. Two of the workers were fired and the third was put on unpaid leave, according to the filing. The board official, Cornele Overstreet, asked the court to reinstate the workers at Starbucks with their normal work hours and their disciplinary records expunged. Oversreet also asked that a high-ranking Starbucks official be required to read the court order aloud in the presence of a board official, and that a video recording of the reading be made available to Starbucks workers around the country. The board can go to federal court seeking such an injunction when it believes workers have been threatened during an organizing campaign, and that such threats could lead to “irreparable harm” if they aren’t stopped. In this case, Overstreet argues that Starbucks’ actions have led to an atmosphere of retaliation, and that workers could “irreversibly lose” the board’s protections if something isn’t done quickly. If granted, such an injunction would mark a significant win for Workers United, the union that’s been organizing Starbucks stores around the country since last year. The union has accused Starbucks of retaliating against a number of union activists in order to cool the organizing campaign. In this case, labor board officials found merit in the allegations. “In seeking an injunction, the labor board argues that Starbucks’ actions have led to an atmosphere of retaliation.” Starbucks has maintained that it was justified in disciplining the Arizona workers. “We wholly disagree with the claims by the [labor board] in this complaint. These partners were terminated because they violated our established policies,” a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement. “A partner’s interest in union representation does not exempt them from the standards we’ve put in place to protect partners, customers, and the communities that we serve.” Shortly before Overstreet sought the injunction in federal court, board officials filed a separate complaint against Starbucks at the NLRB on Friday. That complaint was related to a group of Memphis, Tennessee, workers who were terminated, known as the Memphis 7. Starbucks fired those workers in February after a local television station conducted an in-store interview with them about the organizing effort. Starbucks said the workers violated company policy by allowing nonemployees into the store while it was closed, among other alleged infractions. But a regional director for the board in New Orleans, Kathleen McKinney, said Starbucks fired the seven employees because they “assisted the Union and engaged in concerted activities” that are protected under labor law. She also said managers “confiscated and removed pro-union materials from the community bulletin board” at the store. McKinney said Starbucks should have to make the fired workers “whole,” including by “reimbursing them for all consequential harm they incurred as a result of [Starbucks’] unlawful conduct.” The charge related to the Memphis workers would be litigated within the NLRB. But it’s still possible board officials will go to federal court seeking an injunction like the one for the workers in Arizona. Starbucks has roughly 9,000 corporate-owned stores in the U.S., all of which were nonunion until Workers United began organizing last year. So far 26 stores have voted to unionize, and many more have petitioned the labor board to hold elections. This story has been updated with comment from Starbucks. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Late Disclosures Concealed The Extent Of Amazon’s Anti-Union Campaign,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost While Amazon workers in Alabama and New York were trying to unionize their warehouses last year, the tech giant hired a large cast of anti-union consultants to undermine the organizing campaigns. Known as “persuaders,” these consultants led meetings in the warehouses and pulled workers aside for one-on-one conversations, all with the aim of turning workers against the idea of a union. The law requires that persuaders file timely disclosure forms with the Labor Department, so that workers understand who their employer has hired and how much they are paying them to lobby against unionization. But it appears the firm that performed the most work for Amazon last year did not report its arrangement with the company until well past the legal time frame for doing so, HuffPost has found. Other consultants seem to have filed late disclosures as well. The consultants’ apparent failure to report their dealings with Amazon within a reasonable amount of time left workers in the dark about the details of their employer’s pressure campaign. Some disclosures weren’t submitted to the Labor Department until the ballots were literally about to be counted in both union elections at the end of March, defeating the entire point of the transparency law. “It’s useless to people a year after they provided the service,” said Connor Spence, an Amazon worker and vice president of membership for the Amazon Labor Union. Spence was researching Labor Department filings as his union campaign was underway at the JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island, New York. He believed it was important to uncover the consultants’ arrangements with Amazon so workers could make an informed decision about their vote. But he had little faith that the filings in the Labor Department’s online database accurately reflected the scope of the company’s consulting army. Workers at the JFK8 warehouse ultimately voted 2,654 to 2,131 in favor of joining the Amazon Labor Union, a stunning upset that established the first Amazon union in the U.S. The results are still not clear in a separate union election at Amazon’s BHM1 warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. Workers there have voted 993 to 875 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, but more than 400 challenged ballots could still change the outcome. Both employers and consultants must disclose details of their relationships to the Labor Department, just as unions must file in-depth annual reports laying out their finances. The employers’ reports are due at the end of the first quarter the year after the consulting work was performed. But the consultants must inform the government about their dealings within 30 days of an agreement being made with the employer. “It’s useless to people a year after they provided the service.” It can be helpful for union organizers and supporters to be able to show their co-workers how much their employer is spending on anti-union consulting as opposed to, say, giving them modest raises. As HuffPost first reported, Amazon’s disclosure filings show it spent roughly $4.3 million on anti-union consultants last year, with a typical rate of $3,200 a day for each consultant, plus expenses. More than $2.9 million of that money went to the Michigan-based Rayla Group, whose president is listed as Penne Familusi-Jackson. Familusi-Jackson signed an agreement with Amazon on Oct. 12, 2021, which would have made her disclosure filing due in mid-November at the latest. But Familusi-Jackson’s disclosure form appears to have been submitted on March 31, the day ballots in both elections were being counted. It listed 16 persuaders on the Amazon campaign. In her contract with Amazon, Familusi-Jackson agreed to file disclosures to the Labor Department “within the prescribed timeframes.” When reached by phone and asked about the timing of her disclosures, Familusi-Jackson said she would get back to HuffPost. She didn’t respond to follow-up texts. Another consultant, Katie Lev, signed an agreement on Oct. 28 for her firm, Lev Labor, to help Amazon on Staten Island, according to Amazon’s annual filing. The contract noted seven other individuals who would work for the firm there. Lev did not respond to repeated emails or phone calls from HuffPost asking about her Amazon work. She appears to have filed a disclosure form on April 21, shortly before this story was posted. Consultants only have to report their activities if they speak directly with workers about unionization, as opposed to simply coaching managers on what to say. Lev wrote in her filing that her services for Amazon were “predominantly employee relations work,” suggesting it didn’t need to be disclosed. She said she was doing so “out of an abundance of caution.” In a recent disclosure for her union-related work on behalf of the custom map company Mapbox, Lev claimed she was “hired to educate rather than persuade”: “All voters were encouraged to vote the way that was best for them and not to feel pressured.” Lev’s firm received at least $371,000 for its Amazon work last year. Consultant Edward Echanique reached an agreement with Amazon on Nov. 8 to persuade workers at the Staten Island warehouse, according to filings. Echanique’s disclosure for that work is dated Jan. 3, 2022, weeks after the end of the 30-day window. Echanique didn’t respond to voicemail messages or texts asking if he had disclosed his work on time. Amazon said in its filing that it made no payments to Echanique during 2021, so details of any payments made to him this year probably won’t be public until 2023. A disclosure form for consultant Bradley Moss’ Amazon work appears to have been submitted on March 30, 2022 ― the very last day of voting at the JFK8 warehouse. Reached by phone, Moss said the form would have been submitted by the companies of David Burke, a union avoidance consultant who Moss worked for. (The union alleges that in the course of his work, Moss referred to the union’s leaders, Chris Smalls and Derrick Palmer, who are Black, as “thugs.”) According to Amazon’s filings, the company paid Burke through two entities: a firm called Labor Information Services, of which Burke is president, and the Burke Group, of which he’s also president. Burke first disclosed his Amazon work in a filing last March, and workers were well aware of his presence in the campaigns. His groups received at least $691,000 for their Amazon work in 2021. A woman who answered the phone for Labor Information Services acknowledged that some of the disclosure forms it was responsible for had been late, including Moss’. She attributed it to a mix-up. She noted that an annual filing that detailed the firm's work for Amazon had been submitted in early March. The Office of Labor-Management Standards, a branch of the Labor Department, enforces disclosure requirements. A spokesperson for the office said in an email that it could not comment on specific cases or potential violations, but noted that enforcing the disclosure requirements “is our No. 1 priority.” “We are aware that some employers and consultants have filed deficient reports, and others have not yet filed reports covering reportable agreements and expenditures,” the spokesperson said. The vast majority of filings handled by the office involve unions and their finances. But the office’s director, Jeffrey Freund, has said he’s trying to improve compliance on the management side. He said the evidence suggests many employers and consultants are not disclosing what the law requires. He has even started promoting a tip line. The Labor Department generally does not pursue criminal cases against employers or persuaders for not filing their forms when they’re due. If officials believe someone has failed to follow the law, they may open an investigation and pressure the parties involved to rectify something that’s late or incomplete. But under the law, criminal prosecutions can only arise when the violations are “willful,” which can be difficult to prove. The lack of serious penalties is one reason reports are filed late or probably never filed at all. Amazon declined to comment on its consultants’ fillings. The company submitted its own disclosure report on time, listing the payments to its consultants for 2021 in its report last month. But by waiting until the last moment for an employer to do so ― that is, March 31 ― Amazon was able to keep its anti-union spending out of the public eye until labor board officials were counting ballots in both union elections. “It appears the firm that performed the most work for Amazon last year did not report its arrangement with the company until well past the legal time frame for doing so.” On Staten Island, the Amazon Labor Union had been asking to hold its election at a later date, according to Seth Goldstein, a lawyer who’s been advising the young union pro bono. Goldstein said Amazon had pushed for an earlier election and ultimately succeeded, with the labor board setting March 30 as the date for voting to end. Spence knew he wouldn’t see the full sum of Amazon’s anti-union spending until after the fact. “It was very convenient” for Amazon, he said. “Literally the next day they had to disclose how much they paid the union-busters.” Spence and others have argued for tighter reporting requirements and stiffer penalties for companies and consultants who fail to disclose their dealings. Terri Gerstein, a senior fellow at the Economic Policy Institute think tank, recently argued in The American Prospect that employers like Amazon should have to reveal their persuaders sooner. She noted the murkiness surrounding the Rayla Group: The firm’s address appears to be a post office box at a UPS Store in Troy, Michigan. “​​When well-paid proxies are deployed to convince people not to unionize, those workers have a right to know the specifics,” Gerstein wrote. The victory of the Amazon Labor Union at JFK8 will probably force Amazon and other employers to reevaluate their playbook when it comes to anti-union campaigns. But for now, Amazon still seems reliant on persuaders to make their case against unionization in the warehouses. The Amazon Labor Union says several consultants have turned up at a smaller Staten Island facility, known as LDJ5, where a union vote is expected to be held later this month. Spence said the union was successful at JFK8 in part because workers exposed the consultants and their work, relying mostly on the consultants’ past filings related to other employers. It wasn’t always easy. Spence said some consultants concealed the names on their visitor badges and refused to identify themselves. He said it would be much better if workers could see their employer’s contracts with consultants in real time, as opposed to having to wait months, or even over a year, to see what their agreement was. “We still won,” Spence said. “But it would have been very helpful to show all that [information] to employees.” This story has been updated with details on Lev’s work for Amazon.

3,What Netflix's Subscriber Troubles Could Mean For Other Streaming Platforms,business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost In the age of the streaming wars, the news that Netflix suffered its first subscriber loss in a decade prompted questions about what’s next for the company and the other players in the market. HuffPost looked at Netflix’s response and talked to experts in the industry to answer some of those queries. Netflix, which is still the top player in the industry — at least for now — with almost 222 million subscribers, attributed the drop in subscribers in part to Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the company suspended its service in Russia and gradually shut down all Russian paid subscriptions. In an effort to cut its losses, the company announced it will roll out a lower-priced, ad-supported version of its service, a move that has long been resisted by CEO Reed Hastings, and will also crack down on password sharing, as the company estimates 100 million households worldwide have been free riders on the service. “Those who have followed Netflix know that I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,” Hastings said in a first-quarter earnings interview. “But as much I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice. And allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant get what they want makes a lot of sense.” Hastings said the company is hoping to add the plan over the next two years. George Geis, a professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said people in the industry used to say Netflix was a guaranteed winner. However, “Netflix has some challenges with respect to figure out how to add additional media to its traditional content streaming,” Geis told HuffPost. “And it’s not going to be easy.” He added that Netflix will have to see if the steps it has already announced, along with a push into gaming, will be enough to turn the company around. Another area the streaming service could expand into is live sports. Asked if the company is also looking at sports, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said leadership is not sure adding that offering would contribute meaningfully to the company’s profit. “I’m not saying we never would do sports, but we would have to see a path to growing a big revenue stream and a big profit stream with it,” Sarandos said during the earnings call. The company is instead focused on “sports-adjacent programming,” like “Formula 1: Drive To Survive” and other sports documentaries. Geis also said Netflix would have to overcome the churn that a lot of markets in the U.S. are seeing and get more disciplined on spending moving forward. “Somehow it must get a must-see program on a regular basis, if it’s going to stop that churn, and somehow it must do that in a way that doesn’t allocate $20 billion a year to programming costs,” Geis said. Still, Geis warned, Netflix is facing an existential threat. “I think Netflix right now is in a battle for its life, particularly its valuable life,” he said. “It’s really a serious battle.” Asked if other companies with a streaming offering should be worried by Netflix’s news, Jim Milio, an executive producer who has worked in the film and TV industry for 40 years, said, “It depends on how diversified they are.” “When you look at Netflix, it really just is a streamer,” Milio told HuffPost. “They didn’t diversify. They didn’t buy other companies. They don’t really have a lot of things to fall back on, aside from subscription base.” That means companies like Disney, Amazon and Apple, which have other businesses besides their streaming platform, could be in a better position. “I think the big lesson here is that streaming is not the be-all and end-all,” Geis said. “Streaming is an intriguing market, but it’s not going to be the one that’s going to be able to sustain any companies,” he continued. As consumers, we have a plethora of options when it comes to streaming platforms. Milio doesn’t think all of them will survive. “Some are going to fall, some are going to merge, some are going to be acquired. And some, like Quibi, are going to go out of business,” Milio said. Quibi, a streaming service designed to offer short videos on smartphones, shut down six months after launching, even though it had raised $1.75 billion. CNN+, a subscription service that launched at the end of March, confirmed Thursday that it would be shutting down on April 30. CNN’s former parent company, Warner Media, merged with Discovery just weeks after the launch of the service, which reportedly has about 150,000 subscribers. David Zaslaz, CEO of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery, has said he wants to have all the company’s brands under one streaming service and was annoyed that CNN+ launched shortly before the merger, according to Variety. Fox News, which also launched a streaming service called “Fox Nation” in 2018, has yet to publish how many subscribers it has. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,Musk Says He Has $46.5 Billion In Financing Ready To Buy Twitter,business," Elon Musk says he has lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, and he’s trying to negotiate an agreement with the company. Last week, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media company for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion. At the time, he did not say how he would finance the acquisition. The Tesla CEO said Thursday in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that he’s exploring what’s known as a tender offer to buy all of the social media platform’s common stock for $54.20 per share in cash. Under a tender offer, Musk, who owns about 9% of Twitter shares, would take his offer directly to other shareholders, bypassing the board. But Musk hasn’t decided yet whether to do that. The documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission say San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. has not responded to Musk’s proposal. Last week Twitter’s board adopted a “poison pill” defense that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. The filing states that “entities related to (Musk) have received commitment letters committing to provide an aggregate of approximately $46.5 billion.” The financing would come from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions. Some would be secured by stock that Musk owns in Tesla, the electric car and solar panel maker. Other banks involved include Barclays, Bank of America, Societie Generale, Mizuho Bank, BNP Paribas and MUFG. Shares of Twitter were down slightly to $46.69 in Thursday morning trading after the financing became public. The share price is $7.51 below Musk’s offer. Musk “is seeking to negotiate a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Twitter ... and is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately,” the documents say. With a tender offer, Musk would try to get other shareholders to pledge their stock to him at a certain price on a certain date. If enough shareholders agree, Musk could use that as leverage to get the board to drop the poison pill defense. Musk signaled the possibility of a tender offer several times this week in tweets using the word “tender.” 🎶 Love Me Tender 🎶"
11,Starbucks Union Spreads To Virginia With 5 Election Victories,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The union representing Starbucks workers won a clean sweep of five store elections in the Richmond, Virginia, area on Tuesday, showing no signs of slowing as they try to organize the coffee chain store by store. The campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has now won more than 20 union elections and lost just two since the first votes were held late last year, although not all election results have been certified. None of the chain’s more than 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores were organized before. A union needs to win a majority of votes cast to become the bargaining representative for a workplace. The union prevailed in all five store votes Tuesday in decisive fashion: 17-1, 22-3, 11-2, 13-8 and 19-0. Last week, the union lost a close election at a store in Springfield, Virginia, where workers voted 10-8 against unionizing. That vote had been preceded by a number of unanimous counts elsewhere in favor of the union. The campaign is one of the most closely watched organizing efforts in decades. Union membership has been on the decline for years, and unions have struggled to gain a toehold in the fast-food economy. The success of the Starbucks campaign and a recent union victory at Amazon have kindled hopes of a labor resurgence, with unions seeing their highest approval ratings in years. Starbucks has put up stiff resistance to the organizing campaign, with managers trying to persuade workers to vote against the union and CEO Howard Schultz painting the campaign as outsiders. “We can’t ignore what is happening in the country as it relates to companies throughout the country being assaulted, in many ways, by the threat of unionization,” Schultz recently said. The company has also fired a number of outspoken union supporters recently. Starbucks says those workers violated company policy, but the union has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation. Bloomberg recently reported that board officials have determined that seven terminations in Memphis, Tennessee, were illegal. As the union continues to rack up election victories, the battleground is shifting to the bargaining table, where workers will try to secure a first union contract. A Starbucks spokesperson predicted in an interview with HuffPost last week that “developing a contract that meets or exceeds what we already offer to our partners is going to be difficult for them to do.” Schultz recently said in a company forum that Starbucks might roll out new work benefits that it couldn’t unilaterally give to the unionized stores. Correction: This story originally mischaracterized Schultz’ statement in the company forum regarding new benefits. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
12,"Elon Musk Boasts That Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Co. Are 'Philanthropy'",business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost In a wide-ranging interview streamed during last week’s TED Conference in Vancouver, Canada, Elon Musk characterized the companies that have made him a multibillionaire as “philanthropy” — and he wasn’t kidding. “If you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult,” Musk told TED Talks head and unabashed fan Chris Anderson at the Tesla factory outside Austin, Texas. “SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Co. are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy is love of humanity, they are philanthropy.” Philanthropy means “love of humanity” in Greek. But Musk running companies making him the richest human in the world is not the common understanding of what motivates philanthropists. Musk noted that Tesla is “accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love ... philan-thropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure the long-term survival of humanity with a multi-planet species. This is love of humanity. ... Boring Co. is trying to solve traffic, which is hell for most people,” he added. Musk didn’t discuss how his intention to purchase Twitter for $43 billion could be construed as philanthropic. Musk also touted his simple life, indicating that he’s virtually homeless and is rotating through friends’ “spare bedrooms.” He usually doesn’t vacation or own a yacht, but does use his private jet, he admitted. Musk has also been busy having kids — seven of them — again noting he’s doing his bit to help save the planet. “I’m trying to set a good example because the birth rate is so low that we’re facing civilizational collapse — unless we return to a sustainable level,” he said. “Population collapse is one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization, and that is what is going on right now,” Musk added, highlighting a key fear of his. The world’s population is still increasing, but at a rate of about 1% annually, down from a peak of about 2.1% in the 1960s, and the cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic on population growth are still being measured, according to The Hill. As for Tesla, Musk insisted he’s driving around Austin in his car largely in Autopilot mode — despite increasing concerns about accidents linked to the technology. (He has derided the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating Tesla crashes, as the “fun police.”) “The car currently drives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions,” he boasted. Check out Musk’s full interview in the video clip up top. He discusses his “philanthropies” beginning at 1:02:30. He touts his Autopilot success at 16:43. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
13,"New Lawsuit Tussle Between Elon Musk, Tesla Investors Raises Red Flags About Twitter Deal",business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost As Twitter investors are sizing up Elon Musk’s takeover offer, Tesla stockholders who are suing him over another matter have asked a judge to stop Musk from commenting on their case. Tesla shareholders filed a fraud lawsuit against Musk in 2018 after he posted 218 tweets about taking the company private, which he didn’t do. A federal judge determined last week that Musk’s claims that he had secured funding to take Tesla private were false and misleading. The judge also found that Musk made the false statements recklessly and with full awareness of the facts that he misrepresented. Musk’s behavior in the Tesla case is particularly pertinent now as he angles to purchase Twitter, which he has promoted as a way to bolster free speech. Twitter rejected his hostile bid, but Musk hinted over the weekend that it’s not over. Despite the judge’s ruling in the Tesla case, Musk repeated the exact same claim — that he had secured funding to take the carmaker private — at last week’s TED 2022 Conference in Vancouver, Canada. “So I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully,” he said of Securities and Exchange Commission regulators, according to Reuters. “Those bastards.” “I was forced to admit that I lied to save Tesla’s life and that’s the only reason,” Musk added. After Musk’s TED comments, Tesla stockholders asked U.S. District Judge Edward Chen to shut down Musk’s “public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative” about his 2018 tweets. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines after the Tesla tweets, and Musk stepped down as Tesla’s chair to settle SEC claims that he had defrauded investors with his false messages. Musk “had no real planning” when he tried to take Tesla private, New York Times columnist James Stewart said on CNBC last week. “It was all just something [Musk] did on impulse.” Referring to Musk’s Twitter offer, Stewart asked: “Now are we dealing with a situation like that again?” Trends Reporter, HuffPost"
14,"For The Starbucks Union Campaign, A Bruising Contract Fight Is Just Beginning",business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The organizing campaign at Starbucks has succeeded in unionizing nearly 20 of the coffee chain’s U.S. stores so far, a historic breakthrough for the labor movement. But the union effort is now in the early stages of an even heavier lift: negotiating a first contract. Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize. From the perspective of the union, Workers United, securing solid gains in a collective bargaining agreement could turbocharge an already hot organizing drive, and bring many more of Starbucks’ 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores into the fold. Both sides are now girding for what’s likely to be a bruising fight at the negotiating table, one that could ultimately determine the future of unions inside Starbucks. “Developing a contract that meets or exceeds what we already offer to our partners is going to be difficult for them to do,” predicted Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesperson. “These contracts don’t start at the baseline of the benefits that our partners get. That is the full-stop rule. The contract negotiations start at zero.” (After this story ran, Borges said he misspoke about contract talks “start[ing] at zero.” He said he meant to convey that “collective bargaining involves lots of variables, and nobody can predict the outcome.”) Starbucks has already hinted at some of the hardball tactics that might lay ahead. CEO Howard Schultz suggested in a recent company forum that Starbucks could roll out new benefits that would apply everywhere but the unionized locations, since those stores are now negotiating their own work terms. “People who might be voting for a union don’t really understand,” Schultz said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize.” One of the challenges for the union is consolidating its leverage against the company. The campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has been organizing the chain store by store, filing for elections at locations where union support is high. The company has pushed for larger elections that would encompass an entire market — like Buffalo, New York, which is home to the first store to unionize — but the National Labor Relations Board has rejected that argument and sided with the union. The union’s store-by-store strategy is vastly more manageable than trying to unionize Starbucks nationally or market by market. But it technically leaves the union negotiating a contract for every store that joins. Michelle Eisen, a union leader and barista at the first store to unionize, said the campaign views each Starbucks as distinct, and that applying the same exact contract to every outpost “would go against what we said we’ve wanted from the beginning.” Eisen said the union hopes to achieve what might be called a national framework for a union contract ― one that includes basic guarantees across union Starbucks stores, but allows individual shops to address their own concerns. “There are aspects of the company that are consistent in these stores, but there are a lot of aspects that are not,” she said. Eisen said she works at a small walk-in location, known as a cafe in company parlance, and that her store operates differently from a drive-thru store like the one in Mesa, Arizona, that recently unionized. Some contract language for one might not make sense for the other. “We have to find the elements of stores that are consistent and that becomes a national framework ― but allowing for fluidity within the contracts that can cater to each individual store as well,” Eisen said. Starbucks’ Borges said the company has no interest in hammering out national standards of any kind, no matter how many stores decide to unionize. “From our perspective, the law and the NLRB granted the union their argument that each individual store is its own unit,” Borges said. “So now we move forward with individual contracts for each of those stores.” Securing a first contract can be notoriously difficult in the U.S., in part because employers face no meaningful penalties for dragging out the process. It’s a common strategy for companies to bargain “in bad faith” and make no real progress at the table, in hopes union support will dwindle over time and perhaps the union will even be decertified, or purged from the workplace. If only a handful of stores ultimately unionize, it would be easier for Starbucks to stifle the campaign. But the union has filed for elections at more than 200 stores, and so far they have lost only two of the more than 20 vote counts that have already occurred (the results have not been certified for some of them). At this pace, the union is likely to gain more leverage at the bargaining table and more public support. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other,” said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “So we know that the workers that are already at the bargaining table at one store are going to try to get a broad understanding of what the workers everywhere want as they establish their demands.” Borges assured the company would bargain in good faith: “We’re going to be respectful, we’re going to honor the process.” But achieving a contract could realistically take years, and will ultimately depend on the company’s willingness to reach one. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other.” Starbucks has deployed dozens of lawyers from the union-avoidance law firm Littler Mendelson to slow the pace of union elections, and has dispatched Starbucks managers to persuade workers to vote against the union. But Givan said fighting a union effort at each store becomes less tenable as the campaign grows. “It will be hard to maintain that strategy at potentially dozens of bargaining tables, especially when workers are fully aligned and in coordination with each other,” she said. Starbucks has also fired a number of known union supporters. The company maintains that these terminations were all for legitimate reasons, but labor board officials have already determined that seven firings in Memphis were in response to union activism and therefore illegal. Bloomberg recently reported that the labor board will pursue a case against Starbucks if it doesn’t agree to a settlement. As workers speak out about the company’s handling of the union campaign, Starbucks could face a backlash from consumers that affects its bottom line. The stakes could be even higher in an ugly contract fight if the union enlists labor-friendly politicians and other high-profile supporters willing to criticize the company. Sharon Block, a labor law professor at Harvard University and former official in the Biden White House, said the brand dynamic is “hard to quantify,” but reputable considerations must figure into Starbucks’ calculus. “I imagine it weighs on their decision-making,” she said. “It isn’t just about doing the [financial] math.” If workers can successfully organize hundreds of stores, there may be a point in which Starbucks finds it in the company’s interest to acknowledge itself as a union employer and bargain accordingly, rather than continue to wage a battle at every store where a union petition pops up. Eisen said she thinks about that prospect often, and wonders how much organizing it would take to get there. She said unionizing a single store takes much longer than one might expect. She believes public support for the campaign might matter more in the end than how many stores wind up in the union’s column. “We get stronger, obviously, with every petition that’s filed and every store that wins,” she said. “The hope is that if the company is really who they’ve professed to be for the last 50 years, that there’s still room for them to make changes and get onboard and become the corporation that truly is progressive and leads by example.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Elon Musk Offers To Buy 100% Of Twitter,business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash to take the company private, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing he released Thursday. “I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced,” said Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. His offer values Twitter at about $43 billion. Musk tweeted the SEC filing to his over 81 million followers. I made an offer https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu At a TED event later on Thursday, Musk acknowledged that he is “not sure” he’ll actually be able to acquire the company, but he made the offer because he believes “it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech.” He suggested the website should have an open-source algorithm and make any changes to people’s tweets — promotions, demotions, and edits to a tweet after publishing — visible to users. Musk is at the top of Forbes’ “The Real-Time Billionaires List,” with a net worth of over $270 billion. As of Thursday afternoon, shares were trading well below Musk’s $54.20 offer price, suggesting investors had little confidence in his proposal. Tesla was down modestly. Musk, who currently owns about 9% of Twitter and is the company’s biggest shareholder, said Twitter needs to be “transformed as a private company.” “I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Musk is quoted as saying in the filing. “My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,” Musk said. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.” Twitter confirmed it had received the “unsolicited, non-binding” offer, which it said would be reviewed by its board. On Sunday, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced Musk would not be joining the company’s board, despite his large investment in the company. “I believe this is for the best,” Agrawal wrote in a statement. “We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or not.” Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the company, sharing with you all here. pic.twitter.com/lfrXACavvk Musk had been appointed to Twitter’s board earlier, “contingent on a background check and formal acceptance,” according to Agrawal. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is facing a lawsuit for not disclosing his initial investment in Twitter to the SEC sooner. Musk has also had a longstanding battle with the SEC. In 2018, the regulator charged Musk with securities fraud for “misleading” tweets about his intention to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Musk settled for $40 million. Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. He also had to give up the Tesla board chair’s seat for three years and agreed to allow the company to preview any statement he intends to make about Tesla. In February 2019, the SEC asked a judge to hold Musk in contempt over tweets misstating production targets for the carmaker, causing Tesla’s shares to fall by more than 3%. The tweets in question had not been reviewed by the company, as mandated by the 2018 settlement. Sarah Ruiz-Grossman contributed reporting. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

0,The Starbucks Union Campaign Has Won 16 Elections And Lost Just One,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The union representing Starbucks workers continues to grow every week. Workers at all three of the coffee chain’s locations in Ithaca, New York, voted almost unanimously to join the union Workers United on Friday. The election results for the trio of stores were 19-1, 13-1 and 15-1. Meanwhile, workers at a store in Overland Park, Kansas, voted 6-1 in favor of unionizing, although several ballots have been challenged and could still change the outcome. The union said it expects to prevail once the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that oversees union elections, has reviewed the eligibility of the challenged votes. The election wins Friday came on the heels of three other victories the day before, when workers at a group of Starbucks stores in the Buffalo and Rochester areas of New York all voted to unionize. Following this week’s vote counts, the campaign known as Starbucks Workers United has won 16 elections and lost only one, and now represents hundreds of workers in several states. All told, the campaign has filed for elections at roughly 200 stores around the country, making it likely many more will choose to unionize. Starbucks has roughly 9,000 corporate-owned stores in the U.S., and these are the first in the country to have union representation. High-profile union backers including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) congratulated the campaign on its success Friday, with Sanders calling it “an enormous inspiration to workers all across the country.” THREE MORE enormous victories for @SBWorkersUnited! This movement of workers standing up and asserting their right to dignity and respect on the job has been an enormous inspiration to workers all across the country. Onward! https://t.co/qJYPQk17Jo Starbucks has opposed the union campaign and held meetings with workers urging them to vote against the union. The company has managed to delay elections by filing appeals with the NLRB, arguing that workers should vote in elections on a regional basis, rather than for individual stores, but the labor board has rejected Starbucks’ arguments. The company has fired several workers who happen to be union activists, including seven from a store in Memphis, Tennessee. Workers United has filed charges with the labor board arguing that the firings are retaliatory and meant to purge union supporters from the ranks. Starbucks has said it fired the Memphis workers because they violated company policy by allowing nonemployees into the store outside of work hours. Bloomberg reported Friday that the labor board has determined the Memphis firings were illegal and intends to pursue a case against Starbucks unless the company chooses to settle. The labor board’s actions could result in workers being reinstated on the job. “The Starbucks campaign has filed for union elections at roughly 200 stores around the country.” The Starbucks campaign began last year in Buffalo, where workers unionized the first store in December. The organizing effort has spread like wildfire since then, with the union announcing new election petitions every week. Former longtime CEO Howard Schultz recently returned to the helm of the company as it battles the organizing drive. In a recent talk with employees, Schultz said he was not anti-union, yet described the union campaign in dark terms. ​​“We can’t ignore what is happening in the country as it relates to companies throughout the country being assaulted, in many ways, by the threat of unionization,” he said. The Starbucks union effort coincides with a growing organizing campaign at Amazon. The tech giant recently saw its first U.S. warehouse unionize when workers at the JFK8 facility in Staten Island, New York, voted 2,654 to 2,131 in favor of joining the new Amazon Labor Union. Workers there overcame an intense anti-union campaign waged by Amazon managers and outside consultants. Amazon has already signaled it intends to challenge the vote and have the election results thrown out. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Hertz CEO Vows To Fix Glitch That Falsely Accused Customers Of Stealing Cars,business," NEW YORK (AP) — The new CEO of Hertz says he’s working to fix a glitch in the rental-car giant’s systems that has led to some of its customers being wrongly accused of stealing cars they had rented. Stephen Scherr, who took over as CEO on Feb. 28, said the company has changed its practices to fix problems that have occurred when cars were reported stolen but the transaction was improperly recorded in Hertz’s system. “This is among the first things that I have started to look to take care of and deal with in the first 30 days I’ve been at the company,” Scherr told CNBC on Monday. “It is not acceptable to Hertz to have any customer ... caught up in some of what has happened.” ""Rectifying the situation is a priority of mine.""Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr tells @MattMiller1973 & @JonErlichman that he expects to reach agreement in a lawsuit related to car thefts and false arrest claims https://t.co/uxRojVn1Td pic.twitter.com/Z0RmYFpf1l Some Hertz customers have said they were arrested and jailed because the company accused them of stealing cars that they had paid to rent and in some cases had returned long before their arrest. It’s not clear how many people are affected. More than 200 customers asked a federal judge in Delaware to Hertz to disclose records about erroneous theft reports, and the judge ruled in the renters’ favor in February. Scherr said the false reports involve several hundred customers out of Hertz’s 15 million annual transactions, but lawyers for the customers say the number is more like 8,000. “We have changed our policies to avoid the possibility of this happening again,” Scherr said. “No one customer should be put through that.” Scherr said that in some cases, vehicles have been reported as stolen, the report was withdrawn when the vehicle was found, “but that rescission wasn’t recognized.” The CEO of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. appeared on CNBC to tout a plan to buy up to 65,000 electric vehicles over five years. The Estero, Florida-based company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020, as it struggled under heavy debt and a drop in travel caused by the pandemic. It operates Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty car-rental brands."
2,Biden Labor Appointee Pursues Ban On Anti-Union Meetings At Work,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost A top labor official appointed by President Joe Biden has taken aim at mandatory anti-union meetings at work, saying she will seek a ban on them. Jennifer Abruzzo, the general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, issued a memo Thursday outlining why she believes such meetings are illegal. She said she will pursue a case before the full NLRB in hopes of having them outlawed. These meetings typically involve a manager or outside consultant delivering anti-union talking points to workers considering unionization. Unions call them “captive audience” meetings because attendance is often required, or implied to be. The meetings have bedeviled labor groups for decades, since they generally don’t have a similar, guaranteed platform inside the workplace to make their case for unionizing. Abruzzo’s move to ban them is sure to dismay employer groups, who are likely to fight any such ban in court. The general counsel signaled as soon as she took the job last year that she would try to outlaw these meetings on the grounds that they’re inherently coercive, part of a broader agenda meant to strengthen labor law in favor of workers rather than employers. “They are the major weapon employers use to spread disinformation, intimidate workers and interfere with their choice as to whether they want union representation.” In her memo, Abruzzo said she would ask the board to forbid them in two situations: when workers are “forced to convene on paid time,” or when they are “cornered by management while performing their job duties” to hear anti-union talk. The latter situation would seem to include not just group meetings but some one-on-one talks between managers and workers as well. “In both cases, employees constitute a captive audience deprived of their statutory right to refrain, and instead are compelled to listen by threat of discipline, discharge, or other reprisal — a threat that employees will reasonably perceive even if it is not stated explicitly,” Abruzzo wrote. To accomplish such a change in precedent, a general counsel would find a good case and then try to bring it before the five-member labor board, which serves as a high court for labor law. The board currently has a 3-2 Democratic majority, due to Senate-confirmed appointments made by Biden. Abruzzo said in her memo that she plans to submit a brief to the board soon on a specific case. A staple of management campaigns for years, captive audience meetings have gained some national attention recently, thanks to high-profile union drives at Amazon and Starbucks. The tech giant deployed the meetings amid campaigns at both its Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8 and its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse known as BHM1. The Amazon Labor Union recently won a historic election at the former, while an election at the latter involving the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union remains too close to call. Both unions filed what are known as “unfair labor practice” charges against Amazon with the labor board, arguing that the meetings should be declared illegal. The RWDSU praised Abruzzo’s memo on the meetings in a statement Thursday. “They are the major weapon employers use to spread disinformation, intimidate workers and interfere with their choice as to whether they want union representation,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the union’s president. “The question of whether workers want a union should be the workers’ choice — not the employers’ — free of intimidation and interference.” The labor board has held captive audience meetings to be legal, but Abruzzo argued that the reading was incorrect. She called it a “license to coerce” that amounts to “an anomaly in labor law.” She said the board’s tolerance of the meetings is “at odds with fundamental labor-law principles, our statutory language, and our Congressional mandate” to protect workers rights. In most cases, unions do not have access to a workplace to speak with workers, typically making their case outside a facility or through home visits. Unions try to prepare workers for captive audience meetings through a process known as “inoculation,” in which they try to debunk management’s claims ahead of time. Amazon spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants last year alone. The company’s consultants held group meetings as well as one-on-one conversations with workers in an effort to get them to vote against the unions in New York and Alabama. The consultants earned a typical rate of around $3,200 a day each. Amazon has not commented on the expenditures. An Amazon worker on Staten Island explained to HuffPost earlier this week how he and his co-workers tried to turn the group meetings into organizing opportunities, rather than the liability they usually are. The union ultimately won the election 2,654 to 2,131. “Once we had an organizer in a meeting, the goal was to completely shut it down,” Connor Spence said. “We’d interrupt them whenever they made inaccurate statements, and ask so many questions that they had no choice but to end the meeting. As time went on, even milder people who were pro-union started speaking out.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
3,Amazon Reportedly Mulling Worker Chat App That Could Ban Words Like ‘Restroom’ And ‘Diversity',business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Amazon is mulling a plan that would limit what words employees are allowed to use on an internal messaging app, according to documents obtained by The Intercept this week. The proposal, first created in November 2021, is part of an effort to create an internal social media network to recognize employees with posts called “Shout-Outs.” The Intercept, citing the documents, said the plan was meant to foster happiness among workers and increase productivity, part of a broader push to gamify the work done inside its facilities. The project, which has not launched, is also meant to include an “auto bad word monitor” to block out profane language and some inappropriate keywords. But, it may also bar a large list of terms as part of its pilot program, including: “I hate,” “This is concerning,” “petition,” “diversity,” “fairness” and “restroom,” among others. “Our teams are always thinking about new ways to help employees engage with each other,” an Amazon spokesperson told The Intercept. “This particular program has not been approved yet and may change significantly or even never launch at all.” Amazon has faced mounting criticism over reports about treatment of employees in its warehouses, including fierce efforts to bust unionization. The ban on the term “restroom” may harken back to reports of the strict, physically demanding protocols in fulfillment centers, including delivery drivers who have trouble finding access to public restrooms. The report comes just days after warehouse workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Staten Island, New York, voted to unionize, a historic win for the labor movement and the first time a union has been formed inside an Amazon facility in the U.S. The victory came after a former Amazon employee who was fired for leading a walkout in 2020 over workplace protections organized a campaign with just a $120,000 budget. Amazon spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants last year alone. The retailer has suggested it may challenge the election results, alleging “inappropriate and undue” influence by the National Labor Relations Board. “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” the company said in a statement.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,How Amazon Workers Beat The Union Busters At Their Own Game,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Faced with union organizing efforts in Alabama and New York City last year, Amazon did what most U.S. employers in its position would do: It went out and hired a bunch of anti-union consultants to throttle the campaigns. An unknown number of these consultants cycled through Amazon’s JFK8 fulfillment center on Staten Island from last year until this March. Many of them had the misfortune of crossing paths with Connor Spence. Spence, 26, is a tier 1 associate at JFK8, and vice president of membership for the Amazon Labor Union, the new independent labor group that stunned the country last week by winning an election and creating the first union inside Amazon’s U.S. operations. Spence had no prior experience in labor organizing, but he took a particular interest in these “union avoidance” consultants, and was determined to see the union beat them at their own game. It did: Workers ultimately voted 2,654 to 2,131 in favor of unionizing, in what’s already considered one of the greatest labor victories of the last century. In an interview with HuffPost, Spence explained how he and his friends pulled it off. “Their job is to operate in the shadows,” Spence said of the consultants. “When you expose them for what they are, it makes it very difficult for them to do their job.” According to Spence, Amazon ran a two-pronged campaign against the fledgling union — one “above ground” and the other “below ground.” The above-ground campaign consisted of large group meetings where someone — often an Amazon manager — delivered scripted speeches and slideshows aimed at undermining the union. These are commonly called “captive audience” meetings, because employees have no choice but to attend. The below-ground campaign belonged primarily to the consultants. Paid a typical rate of $3,200 a day apiece, the consultants worked the warehouse floor, pulling workers aside for one-on-one conversations. They stood out in their white-collar clothes and were usually white or Latino, with the bilingual ones focusing on Spanish-speaking workers. Some said they were flying back and forth between New York and Bessemer, Alabama, where a separate Amazon union campaign was underway by the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union. Some were nice. Some weren’t. Whatever their dispositions, their goal was to turn workers against the union. Like an experienced organizer, Spence gathered whatever information he could on them. Consultants who have direct contact with workers in an organizing campaign have to report their arrangements, including fees, to the Labor Department. Although these documents only shed light on past work, Spence and his friends were able to compile unflattering dossiers, to show workers that the consultants get rich “convincing poor people to stay poor.” “We turned the internal systems against [Amazon] in ways even some managers wouldn’t know how to do.” They created flyers identifying the most prolific union busters in the warehouse, listing where they’re based (typically far away), and how much money they had earned on union-busting campaigns. They would put stacks of the flyers in break rooms throughout the facility so everyone would see them and know how much Amazon was spending to fly anti-union consultants in from around the country. The consultants sometimes concealed the names on their visitor badges, so Spence urged union supporters to try to figure them out through chit-chat. When one consultant named David refused to divulge his last name, Spence found it on a warehouse list of third-party vendors: David Acosta. “We turned the internal systems against them in ways even some managers wouldn’t know how to do,” Spence said. The union Twitter account sent out a “union-busting alert” on Acosta, with his photo and disclosure forms listing his fees. According to Spence, Acosta told him he was impressed Spence had figured out his last name. Acosta did not immediately respond to questions from HuffPost on Monday sent via LinkedIn. Another time, the Twitter account blasted out a photo of a consultant in the warehouse identified as Juan Cruz, saying he “tries to hide his name” and “is very mad about this picture.” They urged followers to boost the tweet. As of this writing, it’s been retweeted almost 5,000 times. Hi everyone. This is Juan Cruz, a union buster. He tries to hide his name and lie about who he is to workers at Amazon. He is very mad about this picture too, please help us spread it around because once a union buster is exposed, they can’t do their job. Thank you 😊 #amazon pic.twitter.com/looQiEbDU1 To this day, there are certain consultants Spence was never able to identify. Some were more effective than others. According to Spence, several male co-workers had grown fond of a female consultant who liked to chat them up: “all the guys in her department were in love with her.” When union organizers started bad-mouthing her as a union buster, the men defended her. But the organizers produced copies of her disclosure filings showing she had raked in nearly $20,000 for just one week of union avoidance work. “They felt betrayed,” he said. Spence would follow in the footsteps of the consultants around the warehouse, handing workers copies of the consultants’ Labor Department filings, showing their $300-per-hour fees. “Their eyes would get real wide. ’What the fuck? How do they get this job?’ That was probably the best way to discredit them,” he said. Union organizers believed some of the consultants broke labor law by making threats or interrogating workers on their union sympathies, which is illegal. Worried this could weaken union support, they started filing “unfair labor practice” charges at the National Labor Relations Board with the help of Seth Goldstein, an experienced labor lawyer who was advising the campaign. “I thought Amazon was flabby and stupid in some of things they did. They made a lot of mistakes.” Goldstein said they ultimately filed dozens of ULP charges against Amazon, including some that directly implicated the consultants. The campaign succeeded in getting the labor board to pursue a case against Bradley Moss, a consultant who allegedly called organizers “thugs” and suggested unionizing would be futile, which a company can’t legally do. Under pressure from the labor board, Amazon eventually entered into a national agreement saying it wouldn’t retaliate against workers trying to organize. “I thought Amazon was flabby and stupid in some of things they did,” said Goldstein. “They made a lot of mistakes. They have a lot of money, but we were able to bust up the anti-union captive audience meetings and expose the union busters.” Goldstein is an attorney for a local affiliate of the Office and Professional Employees International Union. He worked with the Amazon workers on a pro bono basis and says he received only a T-shirt for the arrangement. Unfair labor practices come with notoriously weak penalties, but they could embarrass both Amazon and the consultant. So after a consultant spoke with a worker, Spence would approach the worker and ask them to recite everything the consultant had said. As Spence got a better handle on the law, he would ask workers if they were willing to talk to the NLRB when it seemed a line may have been crossed — for example, if someone suggested they might lose their jobs. A culture of boldness proved crucial. As the campaign’s support grew, more workers became willing to put their names to these charges — something workers are often afraid to do for fear of retaliation. According to Spence, the more aggressive consultants started moderating their behavior as the unfair labor practice charges piled up, talking less directly about the union and more about working at Amazon. “We were able to get lots of workers to do affidavits,” Spence said. “A major component of our campaign was being brave and not capitulating to fear.” Another element was cunning. Organizers tried to lay traps for the consultants. As a union buster was making his rounds one day, Spence approached a trio of union sympathizers he knew the consultant would speak to. He told one of them to act ardently pro-union; another to act staunchly anti-union; and the third to come off as a fence-sitter. The idea was to see how differently the consultant spoke to the three archetypes, and figure out which was most likely to draw an unfair labor practice charge. “I really wanted to see if we could trip these guys up,” Spence explained. Many experienced organizers would recognize such strategies, but Spence and his co-workers were learning and deploying them on the fly. Unaffiliated with an established labor group, Amazon Labor Union was short on resources but had credibility as a campaign comprised entirely of Amazon employees. Its president, former JFK8 worker Chris Smalls, had been fired in 2020 after leading a walkout over safety issues. The company then schemed to smear him. Spence said Smalls was a favorite subject of the consultants in one-on-one talks. “One thing they’d say is when we win, Chris is gonna be a millionaire. He’s gonna go buy a Lamborghini [with our union dues]. It’s something they would never say in a captive audience meeting,” he said. The captive audience meetings were usually left to Amazon managers, many from out of state, Spence said. Speakers would walk workers through the details of collective bargaining — paying union dues, negotiating a contract — but always with the anti-union subtext that’s the hallmark of these meetings in any campaign. As the union committee grew, they tried to turn the captive audience meetings into opportunities. They would record the talks so they could later correct the information for workers, or file a charge if they believed a speaker crossed a legal line. And they would openly challenge the talking points they were fed, a common organizing tactic meant to show everyone in the room that union supporters weren’t afraid. “Once we had an organizer in a meeting, the goal was to completely shut it down,” Spence said. “We’d interrupt them whenever they made inaccurate statements, and ask so many questions that they had no choice but to end the meeting. As time went on, even milder people who were pro-union started speaking out.” Eventually, Amazon started trying to cull known union supporters from the room. “They got frustrated and started throwing our members out, which just enraged everybody,” Goldstein said. Organizers will never get a full picture of how much Amazon poured into its failed effort to defeat the campaign. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its anti-union spending. Disclosure forms Amazon filed last week show it doled out $4.3 million to union-avoidance firms last year, but that figure would not include most of its legal work, or much of the anti-union messaging it plastered around its warehouses through posters and televisions. Meanwhile, the results of a separate election at the BHM1 fulfillment center in Bessemer remain too close to call. The RWDSU is trailing 875 “yes” votes to 993 “no” votes, but hundreds of challenged ballots could still tip the balance in the union’s favor. Spence believes more Amazon facilities will follow the lead of JFK8 and unionize. He said anything is possible if the organizers inside a warehouse demonstrate their fearlessness to everyone around them. “The whole [idea] was to lead by example,” he said. “The last thing you want is someone to go up to the polling booth and be too scared to check off ‘yes.’ If you can get in the managers’ faces and show how pro-union you are, then voting ‘yes’ seems like nothing in comparison.” Labor Reporter, HuffPost"

12,Applebee's Franchisee Fires Employee Who Sent Email On Exploiting Workers,business," SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) — Applebee’s has confirmed that an employee of a Missouri-based franchisee has been fired after sending an email speculating that high gas prices and the end of pandemic stimulus money would force employees to work longer hours for lower pay. “This is the opinion of an individual, not Applebee’s,” Kevin Carrol, Applebee’s chief operations officer, said in a statement, adding that the franchisee terminated the midlevel worker. The employee didn’t work directly for Applebee’s. Issues arose after someone shared the email last month with Jake Holcomb, who was the manager of an Applebee’s restaurant in Lawrence, Kansas. He quit soon after he read the email, which said: “As inflation continues to climb and gas prices continue to go up that means more hours employees will need to work to maintain their current level of living.” Holcomb said he printed a couple dozen copies and left them where servers could find them, the Springfield News-Leader reported. “Then, I gave everyone in the restaurant their food for free and we just left; we didn’t even close the store,” he said, adding that he also shared the email with a friend who posted a screenshot to Reddit on March 21.

14,Alaska Airlines Cancels Dozens Of Flights As Pilots Picket,business," PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Dozens of flights along the West Coast were canceled Friday by Alaska Airlines, the same day that off-duty pilots picketed during an impasse in contract negotiations with the airline that have lasted nearly three years. More than 100 Alaska Airlines flights were canceled by the airline, including 66 in Seattle, 20 in Portland, Oregon, 10 in Los Angeles and seven in San Francisco, according to the flight tracking website flightaware.com. Pilots held a rally and picket line in all those cities, according to a union website. Pilots with the Air Lines Pilots Association also protested last week in New York City outside the airline’s Investor Relations Day in a precursor of Friday’s picket. Those on the picket line Friday said they were off-duty and blamed the cancellations on Alaska. The cancellations and picketing come as air travel rebounds to pre-pandemic levels and demand is surging as many Americans head off on spring break for long-delayed vacations. Frustrated travelers vented on social media about botched vacation plans and reported that there was up to a 10-hour wait to speak with an airline representative about rescheduling flights. Many said they couldn’t fly out for a day or two. Robyn Dold, of Battle Ground, Washington, had planned to fly to Missouri on Friday with her husband, daughter and son-in-law to attend her father-in-law’s funeral. The family received an email from Alaska at midnight — six hours before they were to take off — that said their flight was canceled. Dold spent hours Friday on hold with the airline, and then in line at Portland International Airport, only to learn Alaska could not get them to the funeral on time — or even to a city within 10 hours’ driving distance. “We’d go with the flow if it was a vacation, but this is something that has a due date that we can’t change and it’s heartbreaking,” she said in a phone interview. “My husband is beside himself. His father was his very best friend.” Dold, who was to deliver the eulogy, will instead watch the funeral on a one-way livestream with her husband from home, she said. “What I think really irritates me the most, honestly, is that we weren’t given any notification ahead of time that this was a possibility. We could have made other arrangements ahead of time,’” said Dold. “That’s what’s really disappointing.” Pilots have been in contract negotiations with the airline for nearly three years and the two sides are at an impasse. The union says Alaska Airlines did not adequately prepare for a return to air travel after the pandemic and didn’t take the necessary steps to retain or attract pilots as demand bounced back. Issues that still need to be resolved include job security, work rules and quality-of-life provisions that provide flexibility and reasonable schedules, it said in a statement, and the current pilot contract falls well behind those at comparable airlines in several key sections. Alaska Airlines said Friday that it values its pilots and respects their right to picket, but it also needs to negotiate a deal that allows the airline to maintain growth and profitability. Alaska Airlines is working to recover $2.3 billion in losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, it said in a statement. The airline said it currently offers competitive salaries for its pilots. For example, an Alaska Airlines captain’s average salary is currently $341,000 per year, the airline said. ____ Associated Press videographer Eugene Garcia in Los Angeles contributed to this report."
15,Amazon Will Have Its First Union After Historic Upset,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost In a historic win for the labor movement, warehouse workers on Staten Island, New York, have voted to form the first union inside an Amazon facility in the U.S. Employees at the company’s fulfillment center known as JFK8 will be joining a new independent labor group, the Amazon Labor Union, or ALU, following an election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. The union delivered a stunning upset in the vote count held Thursday and Friday, winning 2,654 to 2,131. If the labor board certifies the results to make them official, then the world’s largest online retailer will be obligated to bargain with a union representing several thousand of its employees, something it has never had to do except overseas. Amazon suggested in a statement that it may challenge the results of the election, alleging “inappropriate and undue” influence by the labor board. The company said it was “evaluating our options.” “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” a statement from the company read. Following the conclusion of the vote count on Friday, union members and supporters gathered on the sidewalk outside the labor board office in Brooklyn. Wearing red shirts with the union’s logo, they hugged, celebrated and chanted “ALU! ALU! ALU!” Meanwhile, the labor board conducted a separate vote count Thursday for a different Amazon facility considering unionization, in Bessemer, Alabama. Workers voted 875 to 993 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, but more than 400 other ballots have been challenged and remain unopened, meaning the union could still win after the board determines those voters’ eligibility. In the Staten Island case, Amazon can appeal the election results if it decides to allege misconduct. In response to the company’s claims, Kayla Blado, a board spokesperson, said that the NLRB is an independent agency tasked with enforcing the law, and that all its actions against Amazon “have been consistent with that Congressional mandate.” “[Amazon knows] that people don’t want to be here long, that these jobs break you down physically and mentally.” Amazon has put up stiff resistance against union organizing efforts, inundating workers with anti-union messaging and holding frequent meetings with workers to discourage them from signing union cards or voting for union representation. Disclosure filings that Amazon submitted to the Labor Department on Thursday indicate the company spent $4.3 million last year on labor consultants who help employers defeat organizing drives. Until this week, those strategies had worked. The labor victory in Staten Island is all the more remarkable because of the union’s unlikely roots. Amazon Labor Union was formed just last year by a group of workers in New York. It is led by Chris Smalls, a former Amazon worker whom the company controversially fired early in the pandemic after he spoke out about safety concerns, and Derrick Palmer, who works at JFK8. Most unions have a large staff, including professional organizers, who are paid through workers’ dues to carry out the union’s work. But ALU has not been around long enough to have the resources of an established union. Smalls, Palmer and their fellow pro-union workers organized relentlessly outside the Staten Island facility, holding cookouts, speaking with workers about the campaign and urging them to sign union cards. The group battled the company on TikTok and Twitter and raised money through GoFundMe. “Words can’t describe this feeling,” Smalls told reporters in Brooklyn on Friday. He thanked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for blasting off into space, “because when he was up there, we were signing people up.” After Amazon fired Smalls in 2020, Vice reported on internal company notes that showed Amazon planned to smear him as he spoke out about his termination. The company’s general counsel, David Zapolsky, described Smalls as “not smart or articulate,” and said Amazon appear more credible than Smalls in a public fight. As the vote tally continued on Friday, Smalls sent out a jubilant tweet to remind Bezos and Zapolsky of his treatment. @amazon wanted to make me the face of the whole unionizing efforts against them…. welp there you go! @JeffBezos @DavidZapolsky CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 @amazonlabor We worked had fun and made History ‼️✊🏾 #ALU # ALUfortheWin welcome the 1st union in America for Amazon 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Last month, Smalls was arrested for allegedly trespassing at the Staten Island warehouse after showing up to drop off food for workers, drawing a round of bad publicity for Amazon. The retailer said it had called the police on Smalls, but not on the two other ALU members who were also arrested. The election win for the union is one of a string of recent labor successes at public-facing companies, including Starbucks and outdoor retailer REI. Workers at eight Starbucks stores in three states have unionized so far, and roughly 150 other stores have petitioned for elections. Union membership in the U.S. is hovering near a historic low, with just 6.1% of private-sector workers belonging to unions. Labor activists have debated for years about how to turn around the flagging numbers. Until this week, unions had a poor track record running elections at workplaces as large as an Amazon warehouse. With more than 8,000 workers eligible to vote at JFK8, Friday’s outcome is the biggest election win for the labor movement in years. The young union will now face an even greater challenge: negotiating a first collective bargaining agreement with one of the most powerful companies in the world. It can take years for a union to secure a first contract, and some never manage to. Amazon would have a strong incentive not to offer the union a decent deal, for fear it would only encourage more unionization elsewhere. Last year, Smalls told HuffPost that one of the greatest challenges to organizing Amazon is dealing with the company’s high turnover. Many workers, he said, don’t stay around long enough to be turned into union supporters. “That’s the name of Amazon’s game: Hire and fire,” he said at the time. “They know that people don’t want to be here long, that these jobs break you down physically and mentally.” ALU has called for a wage of at least $30 per hour to accommodate New York’s high cost of living, as well as greater job security. Amazon workers must meet the company’s well-known production quotas or they can lose their jobs with no recourse, something Smalls has said needs to change. “We demand to be treated as human beings and not mere replaceable appendages to the robots and algorithms that run the warehouses,” ALU says on its website. The union originally petitioned the labor board for an election last year, then withdrew it ahead of a vote. After gathering more signatures, the union returned to the board to file its petition with greater support from workers. Later this month, workers at another, smaller Amazon facility on Staten Island are expected to vote on whether to join the ALU as well. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"

0,Former Disney CEO Iger On Opposing Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' Bill: It's Not 'Political',business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Former Disney CEO Bob Iger criticized Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill in an interview on CNN+ released Thursday. “A lot of these issues are not necessarily political,” Iger said. “It’s about right and wrong.” Chris Wallace asks @RobertIger about Disney weighing in on hot-button issues like the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill and the decision-making behind it. #WhosTalkingToChrisWallace pic.twitter.com/u20jYbl9gx Iger, who ran Disney from 2005 to 2020, said as CEO he would decide whether to address a contentious issues by assessing the impact on Disney’s employees, shareholders and customers. “If any one of those three constituencies had deep interest in or would be affected by whatever the matter was at hand, then it was something that I thought we should consider weighing in on,” he told Chris Wallace. This is not the first time Iger has weighed in on the controversial bill. Iger retweeted President Joe Biden pledging to fight it, on Feb. 25, before Disney’s current CEO Bob Chapek spoke out against it. “If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy,” Iger tweeted. I'm with the President on this! If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy. https://t.co/fJZBzre4yM The bill in question, which allows parents to sue school districts to enforce it, states that classes “by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” Several LGBTQ advocacy groups and families sued Florida over the law Thursday, calling it unconstitutional. Chapek came under fire for initially refusing to take a stance on the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. In his first memo addressing the bill on March 7, Chapek said Disney had an opportunity to create change through producing “inspiring content” and said taking a side on the issue would result in the company becoming a “political football in any debate.” He was then forced to u-turn on his silence, issuing another statement on March 11 apologizing to employees and announcing the company was pausing all political donations in Florida. On Monday, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the bill into law, Disney pledged to support efforts to get it repealed. “Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,” a Disney statement reads. Iger didn’t directly criticize Chapek, Wallace said in a segment with CNN’s New Day previewing the release of the interview. Disney has taken sides on socio-political issues before. In January 2021, the company said it would suspend political donations to those who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s election win in the 2020 election and also threatened to stop filming movies in Georgia in 2016 in response to the state’s anti-gay bill, which was eventually vetoed by then Gov. Nathan Deal. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Results Unclear In Amazon Union Election In Alabama,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Federal officials counted the ballots for an Amazon union election at a warehouse in Alabama on Thursday, but the initial results were too close to call. Workers had cast 875 ballots in favor of joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, with 993 voting against. But 416 more ballots were challenged by either Amazon or the union, and those votes will determine the final outcome. Either side can challenge the eligibility of a worker to vote. It will likely take the National Labor Relations Board weeks to sort out those ballots and figure them into the final tally. “It’s a lot of challenged ballots, well beyond the difference between the yes and no votes,” Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU’s president, said in a press conference after the count. Appelbaum noted recent union wins at Starbucks and REI, saying there was an “important moment going on in our country right now.” “Workers are tired of being treated like a disposable commodity,” he said. “They are tired of being treated like robots.” Meanwhile, a separate vote count was underway on Thursday for a union election at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island. The union in that case, the new Amazon Labor Union, held on to a lead after several hours of counting before officials stopped for the day. The initial results won’t be known until Friday at the earliest. The election in Alabama marked the second time in a year that workers at the Bessemer facility outside Birmingham would decide whether to unionize. The second election came about because Amazon broke the law during the first one, held in early 2021. The union had challenged the results of that vote based on Amazon’s conduct. Labor board officials later determined that the company had tainted the voting process, ordering the do-over. Appelbaum said the union may file objections to how Amazon acted during the second election as well. Amazon deals with labor unions in some countries, but its sprawling logistics network in the U.S. remains union-free. The company now employs roughly 1 million workers in the U.S., most of whom work in warehouses where they pick, pack and ship orders to customers. To unionize a facility through an election, a union must gather signed union cards from at least 30% of the workers to authorize a vote and then win a majority of ballots cast. Unions have not seen much success in recent years trying to organize large facilities like Amazon’s through traditional elections, when often the employer campaigns against the union. Amazon has shown its determination to keep unions out of its warehouses by hiring anti-union consultants and inundating workers with anti-union messaging. During the run-up to the first election, some of Amazon’s consultants were paid $3,200 apiece per day to hold meetings with workers meant to persuade them to vote against the union. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Amazon Spent $4.3 Million On Anti-Union Consultants Last Year,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Faced with a wave of worker activism in its warehouses last year, Amazon paid anti-union consultants roughly $4.3 million in an effort to beat back union organizing campaigns, according to new filings with the U.S. Department of Labor. The disclosures from Amazon offer a glimpse into how far the online retailer is willing to go to stay union-free. Many employers hire anti-union consultants to hold meetings with workers and dissuade them from unionizing, but none seem to match the scale or price tag of Amazon’s efforts over the course of just one year in its sprawling warehouses. Workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment center were required to attend frequent meetings where they heard anti-union talking points from consultants in the run-up to a union election early last year. Workers ultimately voted against joining the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, but federal officials ended up ordering a new election after determining Amazon had broken the law. The company also deployed consultants at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, last year where workers began an organizing drive with the upstart Amazon Labor Union. Workers voted in a union election at that facility in recent days, and the results could be known as early as Friday. (The union was leading in the vote tally when officials stopped counting Thursday afternoon.) Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consulting expenditures. When outside consultants speak directly to workers about unionization, both the employer and the consultant must disclose the arrangement to the federal government. Amazon’s consultants submitted filings to the Labor Department during the organizing campaigns last year showing many of them were each paid $3,200 a day for their work. “Workers in Bessemer told HuffPost last year that they encountered consultants every week, and at one point just about every day.” The employer must inform the government how much it spent in total, but not until the end of the first quarter the following year, which is why Amazon’s total spending in 2021 didn’t come to light until this week. Amazon filed them on Thursday, the deadline to submit them. A 2020 analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found only a few employers have spent more than $1 million on anti-union consultants, and it’s typically taken several years to rack up such a bill. Any spending in the hundreds of thousands of dollars is on the high end. None of the companies in EPI’s analysis came close to spending as much as Amazon in such a short period of time. Unions call the speeches given by consultants “captive audience meetings,” because attendance is typically required. The meetings tend to follow similar scripts, with consultants calling the union a “third party,” focusing on the cost of union dues, and talking up the prospect of work stoppages. Such meetings are legal. In response to Amazon’s disclosures, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU, said the company “spares no expense in trying to crush unions and interfere with what is supposed to be their employees’ choice.” “Captive audience meetings should be outlawed in the United States,” he said. Consultants like to say they are neutral third parties just providing information, but they are hired expressly to defeat unionization efforts. Outside of meetings, consultants also help the company on its overall strategy to defeat the union, and guide supervisors on how to interact with workers and counter union support. Amazon would have spent so much on consultants in part because its workplaces are so large. The warehouses employ thousands of workers over multiple shifts a day, so the company seems to have held almost constant meetings during the critical organizing periods. But Amazon also chose to send individual workers to multiple meetings to make sure its anti-union message got through. Workers in Bessemer told HuffPost last year that they encountered consultants every week, and at one point just about every day. “They were harping a lot on dues,” one worker said at the time. “They were saying, ‘The union’s coming in, and the union is a business. The money they make is gonna be off of you. Your $9 a week, they’re gonna use that money to buy cars.’” The money Amazon has paid consultants is just one portion of its overall spending on anti-union work. Under the law, employers do not have to disclose their arrangements with lawyers or consultants who do not have direct contact with employees. That excludes from disclosure the more expensive work done by attorneys at “union avoidance” law firms like Morgan Lewis, which Amazon hired for the Bessemer election last year.

3,Starbucks Union Notches Another Victory With Eighth Store,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The union organizing Starbucks workers extended its winning streak on Friday, adding an eighth store to the list of unionized locations. Employees at the store in Mesa, Arizona, voted to join Workers United by a count of 11 to 3, according to a vote tally conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. That brings the union’s success tally to five stores in the Buffalo area, two in Mesa and one in Starbucks’ hometown of Seattle. The coffee chain has roughly 9,000 corporate-owned stores around the country, of which those eight are the first to unionize. The newly organized shops represent a tiny fraction of Starbucks’ overall workforce, but the union has petitioned for elections at 150 stores in 27 states, making it almost certain more workers will join. Bradley Logue, a barista at the Mesa store that unionized Friday, said in a statement through the union that he appreciated other stores leading the way. “This is our opportunity to speak up and have a voice for ourselves. We’re doing this not only for us, but for future generations, too,” Logue said. The union’s win in Arizona comes on the heels of a win in Seattle earlier this week, where a group of nine workers voted unanimously to form a union. Starbucks has resisted the organizing effort and tried to dissuade workers from supporting the union in elections. Workers United has accused Starbucks of illegally retaliating against pro-union workers, charges the company has denied. The labor board found merit in the union’s claims related to a store in Phoenix. A company spokesperson told HuffPost earlier this week, “We still believe in Starbucks’ direct relationship with our partners, but will continue to respect the [legal] process.” Labor activists hope the success of the Starbucks campaign so far will serve as a breakthrough in the broader food service industry, which is predominantly non-union. A mere 3.1% of workers in food preparation and service are union members, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The union density rate for the broader private sector is just 6.1%. Sydney Durkin, who works at the Seattle Starbucks that unionized, said Tuesday that their campaign could be “taken as a blueprint and done anywhere.” “Other places can and absolutely should do what we do,” Durkin said.

4,Twitter Users Mock Matt Gaetz's 1st Tweet After His Pardon Request Is Made Public,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) became a victim of “pardon bombing” Thursday on Twitter. It happened after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol revealed that the lawmaker was one of at least five members of Congress who attempted to get pardons from then-President Donald Trump for their roles in helping Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But Gaetz wanted his pardon to be a lot broader than his role in Trump’s election fraud, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. She told the committee that Gaetz had been pushing for a pardon since early December, according to Business Insider. Former White House senior adviser Eric Herschmann told the committee that the “general tone” of the pardon request revolved around the idea that “We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of, you know, the president’s positions on these things.” However, Herschmann noted that the pardon Gaetz was angling for may have been intended to also protect him from the sex trafficking investigation swirling around him. “The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe, from... the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things,” Herschmann told the committee. After the revelation, Gaetz posted on Twitter to accuse the committee of being “an unconstitutional political sideshow” that is “rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents.” The January 6 Committee is an unconstitutional political sideshow. It is rapidly losing the interest of the American people and now resorts to siccing federal law enforcement on political opponents. Many Twitter users responded with variations on the same joke.

5,"At Least 5 Members Of Congress Asked Trump For Pardons, According To Jan. 6 Committee",business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol named five additional Republican Congress members who sought pardons from President Donald Trump. The requests stemmed from their involvement in Trump’s schemes to try to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which Trump insisted he won despite losing by several million votes. The committee previously revealed that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) sought a presidential pardon, something the congressman denied. During Thursday’s public hearing on Capitol Hill, witnesses close to the Trump White House said in previously recorded interviews that Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas) also asked for pardons. “The pardon he was requesting was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things,” former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said of Gaetz in video testimony that the committee played on Thursday. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirmed to the committee that Gaetz and the other GOP members of Congress sought pardons. “Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon,” Hutchinson said. In a statement after the hearing, a spokesperson for Brooks said the congressman only wanted a pardon in case Democrats abused the justice system and started “prosecuting and jailing” their political opponents. Brooks also released an image of the email he sent to the White House in December, on behalf of himself and Gaetz, recommending that the president give “general (all purpose) pardons” to every Republican who voted to overturn the election after the Jan. 6 riot. In a speech at Trump’s rally before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Brooks said, “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” Hutchinson said that she heard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also asked for a pardon but that she didn’t hear it directly. “I heard that she asked the White House counsel’s office for a pardon,” she said. “The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you’ve committed a crime,” Jan. 6 committee member Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said. In a tweet after the hearing, Greene didn’t exactly deny that she had asked for a pardon but said, “Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know. Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.” Thursday’s hearing featured testimony from former Justice Department officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, as well as Office of Legal Counsel director Steven Engel, who described Trump’s efforts to throw out the election despite their objections that doing so would be unconstitutional and contrary to the will of the American voters. Donoghue, who was then acting deputy attorney general, testified that when Trump threatened to replace Rosen as the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, he was told the change would spark mass resignations in the Justice Department. “Mr. President, I would resign immediately. I would not work one minute for this guy,” Donoghue said he told Trump, referring to Clark. During the Jan. 6 committee hearing, Kinzinger described how Perry lobbied the White House to elevate Clark in the Justice Department in order to gain his help in subverting the election. Perry improperly brought Clark to a White House meeting and texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to appoint Clark to a role with “the authority to enforce what needs to be done.” Perry denied seeking a pardon earlier this month. “The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,” Perry said on Twitter. Kinzinger deliberately juxtaposed testimony about pardon-seekers with the live testimony from Justice Department officials who refused to do Trump’s bidding. “They knew that every bit of what they did was a lie and it was wrong,” Kinzinger said of those who sought pardons. “That is all the more reason to respect those who came here to testify today.” Trump last week reiterated his intention to pardon people charged in connection with U.S. Capitol riot if he becomes president again in 2024. “And if I become president, someday if I decide to do it, I will be looking at them very, very seriously for pardons,” Trump said of defendants in the insurrection.

6,Angry Trump Again Demands The Impossible From Jan. 6 Panel After Riveting Hearing,business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump’s reaction Thursday to another powerful day of testimony before the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot was to again demand the impossible: evidence of a rigged presidential election. “The only thing not discussed by the Unselects, in any way, shape, or form, is the irrefutable evidence of massive and totally pervasive ELECTION FRAUD & IRREGULARITIES which took place during the 2020 Presidential Election. They refuse to go there,” he posted. It wasn’t discussed because it never happened. A litany of testimony from former Department of Justice officials on Thursday — and in earlier sessions — refuted Trump’s “irrefutable” claims. Trump appears to be ignoring the information in the hearings the same way he ignored responses from his Justice Department, various state officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr: The claims of a rigged election were baseless. A number of specific claims have been refuted in detail. Trump insisted on Truth Social that it would be “impossible” for the Jan. 6 hearing to “refute or challenge that which would be put before them. To the Unselects, I ask, LET US PUT ON THE EVIDENCE STATE BY STATE.” Neither he nor his supporters have offered any such evidence. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) testified Tuesday that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked him to hold up electoral votes because “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state. Bowers told Giuliani he wanted names and was promised he would get them, he said. Despite repeated requests, he was never given a single name, Bowers testified. Last week, Trump noted on Truth Social that the “Unselect Committee refuses to debate the Election results, the reason for the massive crowd on January 6th, because they can’t.” In a separate post Thursday, Trump asked: “What about the massive ballot stuffing shown ... by the highly respected and credible Patriots of Truth (2000 Mules).” He was referring to a discredited “documentary,” which elicited a derisive laugh from the former attorney general during Barr’s testimony. “I suppose that’s OK by the Unselects? Such lies!” Trump added in his post. Trends Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

7,Former U.S. Attorney General Highlights Trump's 'Smoking Gun' In New Jan. 6 Testimony,business," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday identified what he called the “smoking gun” for criminally charging former President Donald Trump over his conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. Appearing Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general in the last weeks of the Trump administration, testified that Trump directed him to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen” during a Dec. 27, 2020, conversation. Donoghue had written the directive down in his notes and testified that it was an “exact quote from the president.” “This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony, [it] demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind,” tweeted Holder, who served in the Barack Obama administration. Any prosecution of Trump would need to convince a jury that Trump acted with criminal intent to overturn the results of the election, knowing that he had legitimately lost. Trump - “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen”. This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump’s substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind. Donoghue also wrote down that Trump said the Justice Department had “an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.” Asked if the Department of Justice had actually found evidence of corruption in the 2020 presidential election, Donoghue said: “There were isolated instances of fraud. None of them came close to calling into question the outcome of the election in any individual state.” Thursday’s hearing focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Justice Department officials into supporting his scheme to overturn democracy and remain in power. A number of former Justice Department officials have said the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings have delivered compelling evidence that Trump committed crimes. Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, told The Guardian last week that “the committee hearings have bolstered the need to seriously consider filing criminal charges against Trump.” The current attorney general, Merrick Garland, has not yet indicated if Trump is under investigation or if there will be indictments, though he said he would be following the hearings closely.

8,Bob Woodward: 20% Of Republicans Would Now Like To 'Push Trump Off The Cliff',business," Trends Reporter, HuffPost Washington Post Watergate journalist Bob Woodward said Thursday on CNN that “dramatic” hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection are having such a significant impact that “at least 20% of Republicans” would now like to figuratively “push” Donald Trump “off the cliff.” Whether Republicans are watching the hearings “or not, a lot of them know that the earth is shaking,” Woodward’s Watergate partner Carl Bernstein added in a panel interview with Anderson Cooper. “Why is the earth shaking? Because “both the committee and the Justice Department” know that “before, during and after Jan. 6,” there was a “massive obstruction and conspiracy from the president down ... to not allow the transition of power,” Bernstein said. “What we do know, factually, is the Justice Department has the evidence of this massive conspiracy and cover-up,” he added John Dean, a Richard Nixon White House counsel who flipped on him, said the insurrection proceedings are “working much better than the Watergate hearings,” with “very effective ... presentations.” They’re “probably getting to Trump because they are so effective. He appreciates good media.” “We forget how protracted the Watergate hearings were,” Dean noted. “They were seven months. I didn’t testify for a few hours; I testified for five days, eight hours a day. They were grinding. Woodward agreed that the House select committee’s hearings are “very dramatic.” “I think if you can step back, what’s going on here right now in the Republican Party ... 50% roughly of the Republicans would walk off the cliff for Donald Trump,” said Woodward. “Now I think at least 20% want to push him off the cliff.” And 30% are fixated on simply winning, Woodward noted. “If there’s one lesson from writing three books about Trump, spending hours interviewing him, there is the lexicon: Win. You have to win. And they want to win,” he added. Voters “can make the calculation: Is this a winning hand with Donald Trump or not? And it’s eroding. Whether significant, we will see.” The hearings are uncovering “meaty, dramatic” information, Woodward said.

9,Senate Passes Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill A Month After Uvalde Shooting,business," Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The Senate approved a bipartisan bill on Thursday aimed at curbing gun violence, taking action a month after the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, amped up pressure on a response in Congress. Fifteen Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure. The House is expected to pass the bill on Friday and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. The legislation, titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, includes modest curbs on obtaining firearms as well as funding to bolster mental health care and school security. It’s the product of bipartisan compromise after weeks of negotiations led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). The measure enhances background checks for people under 21, incentivizes states to adopt “red flag” laws, which help remove guns from the hands of people who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prohibits romantic partners convicted of domestic violence who are not married to their victim from getting firearms. It does not include broader restrictions sought by gun control advocates, however, such as bans on assault weapons, raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21, mandating safe storage rules at home, or requiring background checks on internet sales and at gun shows. Nevertheless, it’s the most significant federal gun legislation in decades. Democrats and gun control advocacy groups welcomed it as a sign of progress after years of congressional gridlock on dealing with gun violence. “This will become the most significant piece of anti-gun-violence legislation Congress has passed in three decades,” Murphy said ahead of the vote. “This bill also has the chance to prove to the weary American public that democracy is not so broken, that it is able to rise to the moment.” Cornyn, who was met with a chorus of boos at his state party convention last Friday, acknowledged that Republicans had to go outside their comfort zone. But he said the “potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during negotiations.” “I don’t believe in doing nothing in the face of what we’ve seen in Uvalde and other communities. Doing nothing is an abdication of our responsibility,” he said. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

10,There's A Life Coach For Everything These Days,business," On Assignment for HuffPost I was facing some big decisions last year for me and my personally meaningful but financially unsustainable small business. Like everyone else, I was burned out from the pandemic, claustrophobic and ready for change. I felt hammered by the realities of parenting a kindergartener and twin toddlers who always seemed to be on the verge of pulling a knife off the counter or swallowing something dangerous. “I need someone to walk me through all of these layers of choices and complexity,” I thought. “Maybe what I need is a coach?” I never ended up hiring one, but over the previous year, I had been growing more curious about the profession as I noticed acquaintances posting about their new coaching ventures. Many had attended prestigious colleges, gotten advanced degrees and developed accomplished careers. It seemed like every other mom on Instagram had added “coach” to her bio with a seemingly endless number of specialities, like wellness, health, love and relationships; executive, success, business and marketing; coaches focused on anti-racism, personal finance, aging and body image; and many, many coaches for coaches. I wanted to know more about what is behind this boom in coaching and hear from some of the women who are a part of it. I spoke to a number of coaches to try to understand who they are, choosing people who aren’t celebrities or influencers, do not make seven figures and who have worked for years to build up their business. I learned that, despite what the nonstop social media ads I’m now being fed may claim, coaching is not a get-rich-quick profession. These coaches work with people who feel as if the institutions they belong to aren’t supporting their needs, including moms in corporate America, progressive women in conservative churches, or people who are queer, neurodiverse or disabled. Though coaching is a booming business, there is no official credential necessary to call yourself a coach. The International Coaching Federation, the largest nonprofit association for the profession, estimates that coaching is a $3 billion business worldwide. In the past decade, its membership has increased 160%, to more than 50,000 worldwide, and more than 20,000 members have joined in just the last five years. The association was growing before the pandemic, but COVID-19 seems to have ramped it up. The federation saw a single-month record for coaches joining in December 2021. IFC sees itself as serving “professional coaches”: people who spend more than 50% of their time coaching. They define coaching as “partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential.” ICF CEO Magdalena Mook said about 70% of ICF coaches in the U.S. are women. An easy first reason is that women, especially mothers, have borne the brunt of pandemic caregiving, which in turn disrupted their careers, leading many to seek less-conventional livelihoods. According to research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, mothers were nearly three times more likely to report taking on the majority — or all — of the additional caregiving responsibilities due to school closures. At least partially as a result, 1.1 million fewer women are in the workforce now than there were in February 2020. And those who are working aren’t wildly happy: According to a 2022 McKinsey survey, 42% of women said they are often or always burned out, up from 32% in 2020. And many women have been isolated from extended family and in-person social communities and suffered the loss of loved ones during COVID, prompting personal and professional reevaluations. Who wouldn’t want an encouraging person guiding them through this thorny and unprecedented time? The appeal of coaching for women and mothers underscores how unsupported and alone people feel when faced with navigating jobs, caregiving, family and personal fulfillment. After two years of the pandemic, with so many people overburdened by work and care responsibilities, more women than ever are crashing hard against the myth that they could somehow “have it all.” They are grappling with the reality that they don’t, and perhaps coaching feels like a solution to that problem. This pandemic-fueled soul-searching may also be driving the uptick in women becoming coaches themselves. Coaches I spoke with shared that a draw for a career in coaching was that it is flexible, conducive to caregiving responsibilities and provides a service that people feel is meaningful and genuinely helpful. Many coaches also seem to attract clients who have biographies similar to themselves, and in those relationships they can use some of their life experiences to help others. That was the case for Stacy Kim, 53, who has been a certified coach in New York City for 14 years. She has a Ph.D. and was previously a social science researcher at Columbia University focused on work-family issues. Ironically, she came to feel that her full-time job wasn’t compatible with her own family life. She left the full-time workforce for three years before enrolling in a coaching training program, eventually getting certified by ICF. Fitting coaching around her family and caregiving responsibilities appealed to her when making the switch and has proved to be a huge help, especially when she has had to deal with personal crises — like her daughter’s cancer diagnosis in 2017 (she’s now in remission) or needing fly to South Korea to support her mother, who has Alzheimer’s. The IFC estimates that on-on-one coaching typically averages $244 per session, though it can range from $100 to $1,000. Clients don’t always pay this cost, as employers are also increasingly interested in covering coaching for professional goals or work-life integration as an employee benefit. The coaches I spoke with charge between $125 for a single session to $10,000 for a yearlong engagement. The ICF says the average annual earnings for a coach in the U.S. are around $62,000, which is not as lucrative as those high hourly rates might suggest. That’s often because many coaches work part time or have other jobs in addition to coaching. Christy Farr, 46, came to coaching through some soul-searching following her divorce and coming out as gay 13 years ago. She loved that she could work from home (which was far less common then than it is today). But mostly she loved that she was helping others. “When I heard about life coaching, I was like, oh, that’s what I do with people now,” Farr said. “I’ve been this person since I was in middle school.” But coaching hasn’t always been financially successful. She’s had to balance it with caring for her kids, her own health and, more recently, her mother’s health. At the same time, she’s committed to making her services affordable, and she hasn’t raised her private session rate in 10 years. “I’m also not a six-figure coach,” Farr said. “I could be if I had some time and energy that I don’t have. I finally broke $50,000 a year maybe two years ago, and then COVID hit,” when Farr had to cancel some of her more lucrative in-person group coaching and retreat programs. Farr’s expansion into group coaching reflects larger industry trends. Mook said interest in corporate team coaching and group coaching is growing. Those sessions can be less expensive per person than individual meetings and can create a valuable community for the client by showing that they aren’t alone and that the obstacles they face aren’t the result of personal failure. Sessions can be as diverse as the coaches themselves but are usually focused on helping clients articulate an area they’d like to work on, and create goals and plans to support achieving them. Coaches I interviewed described active listening and thoughtful questions as part of the process. Most said they strive to be client-centered about the direction of the session rather than being didactic or telling clients what to do. Some use exercises or have created frameworks to guide people through a self-discovery process. Some mentioned that it is common to work with clients regularly for a few months on a specific issue and then stop meeting consistently once that goal is met. Kim’s clients were initially women and mothers who were successful and high-achieving and didn’t understand why they weren’t happy, even though so much was going well in their lives. Throughout her years of coaching, she’s developed a program called The Lighthouse Method, which is designed to help “smart, caring people who spent so much of their time taking care of other people that they kind of lost their own way.” Kim helps her clients who are weighed down by self-doubt get unstuck and make changes with the goal of finding fulfillment, starting with reconnecting with enjoyable activities with small steps. Farr focuses on relationship coaching and what she calls “space healing” — helping people find motivation “to not just clean up [their physical spaces] but to release the thoughts, beliefs and behaviors that created the chaos.” Many of her clients are women and mothers, identify as LGBTQA+, have a chronic disease or are neurodiverse. “My clients are often unconventional in all the ways, not just one,” she said. Caitlin Olsen, 36, is a trained marriage and family therapist and a mom of three who started building a coaching business in 2020. Olsen, who is Mormon, found the pandemic accelerated both people’s comfort with meeting online and their need for support. “A lot of Mormon women are having really intense faith crises,” she said, particularly in dealing with loved ones who refuse to wear masks, are opposed to the Black Lives Matter movement or support former President Donald Trump. For Olsen, the difference between what she did as a therapist and what she does now as a coach is that she does not offer diagnoses. If a client is dealing with a mental health issue she doesn’t feel her coaching is the right fit for, like an active eating disorder, she can refer them to a licensed therapist. Olsen recently decided to not renew her marriage and family therapist license to do coaching full time. Though Olsen sees the extensive training she did to become a therapist and the years of working with clients as a clinician integral to what she offers now, the red tape that came with her maintaining her license — and getting licensed again in new states after moving with her active-duty military husband — wasn’t worth it. She now describes herself as a trained therapist and mental health coach. Kim said a potential benefit of coaching, in some contexts, is helping people understand that their difficulties are not the result of individual failures or deficiencies. “I saw how systemic these work-family conflicts are, especially for women, and I knew that it’s not a problem that I can solve. But to be able to work one-on-one with people navigating these problems is very, very fulfilling.” In generations past, people feeling lost might have joined a church-led group, volunteered at a soup kitchen, participated in a weekly bridge night or formed a feminist conciousness-raising collective. While none of these communities would directly answer how to chart a new career path, navigate a tricky work situation or realize you are in an unfulfilling marriage, they did provide a space for people to talk and others to listen. “Part of what people get out of coaching is validation and objectivity. Our country’s lack of social support for parents can make you feel crazy,” said Lauren Smith Brody, a gender equity consultant, author of “The Fifth Trimester” and coach for new moms getting back into the workforce after maternity leave. “It’s also someone whose time you aren’t afraid to impose on because you are paying for it,” said Smith Brody. “If there were stronger, real in-person communities, coaching would at least look really different,” Olsen added. Though it’s far too simplistic to say “people are turning to coaches because they don’t have enough friends,” the combination of pandemic isolation and our capitalist society certainly seems like a key to the coaching boom. So much of women’s collective time and energy are spent filling the gaps of our country’s under-resourced safety net, all while prizing “making it on your own” as cultural value. We don’t have the roadmap or bandwidth to contribute to non-monetary personal and community relationships that build invaluable support over time. All the coaches I spoke with for this article were warm, easy to talk to and insightful, and I could imagine someone like me benefiting from working with them. But they all pointed out concerns they have about the coaching industry writ large. In a recent survey, ICF found that “untrained individuals who call themselves coaches” is a top concern for its members. Right now, anyone with any amount of experience or training — including none at all — can call themselves a coach, which everyone I spoke to seemed to agree is a problem. And yet many of the coaches I spoke to also pointed out that there are great coaches who aren’t formally trained or certified. Olsen thinks there should be a middle ground on regulation: “There’s a ton of freedom in being a coach, but that can be scary.” Olsen said she is concerned that under-trained coaches are working with people experiencing mental health issues, especially due to the increased demand for mental health care over the past two years and the difficulty many have in finding a therapist. Farr agreed that coaches need training in recognizing if clients are having mental health issues. “In the beginning [of my coaching career], I would miss red flags that somebody needed more,” she said. She remembers one client in particular who was later diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. Farr said the client had ultimately gotten the mental health support she needed and they’ve stayed in touch; now the client is “properly medicated and doing well, but not because of our work.” At least one group-coaching company requires all of its coaches to take a Mental Health First Aid course so they’re equipped to recognize if a client needs support outside of coaching and can direct them toward those resources — but this is far from an industry standard. Olsen said she is also alarmed by the overlap of coaching with the wellness and beauty industry, especially from influencers with no mental health training but who have large followings and are often trying to sell products. And Farr is wary of coaches who promote themselves as spiritual healers, offering easy tricks or practices to “magically heal” what’s hard in people’s lives. She said she worries these “coaches” can take advantage of vulnerable people and offer advice that is blind to realities of systemic inequality. “If you’re a queer, Black or disabled person, [a coach telling you to] go in and demand what you want all the time, that might not work out, right?” Farr said, pointing to a popular meme that says, “Maybe you manifested it. Maybe it’s white privilege,” as an example of what she would like to see more awareness of in the coaching world. “[These issues] were never addressed in my training 13 years ago,” she said. “I would have been a much better coach to many more people if I’d had any idea of my privilege.” Farr is now taking continuing education classes and workshops on anti-racism in coaching, something she recommends for other coaches. “We can all do professional development and learn how to make our business more equitable, accessible and to learn how to not be harmful.” Mook recommended checking to see where a potential coach has trained and if they have a professional affiliation or any certifications. You should also talk to a prospective coach first — a complimentary 15- or 30-minute introductory call is very common in the industry and can give you a sense of their personality and how they work with clients. It can also be useful to interview multiple coaches. “A good coach will listen and ask really good questions — it’s not a consultant,” said Kim. “It’s far more of a partnership rather than a top-down kind of thing.” When looking for a coach, it may be worth exploring if your coach or program is overpromising or pitching too-good-to-be true results, or that their specific program is all you need to unlock happiness and success. Farr cautioned that people should reject marketing that suggests, “If you really believe in yourself, you’ll invest in yourself.” Farr also warned against going into debt to get a coach’s services. “I don’t want anyone putting my services on a credit card they can’t pay off. Working within your means is really important.” Many coaches have online resources, self-paced courses, books or virtual groups that are more affordable than private sessions. This is a great way to get to know a coach and their methods before investing in sessions. “It’s worth digging and finding what’s really possible for you,” Farr said. “If the door’s locked and then the next door is locked, just keep walking down the hall until you find an unlocked door.” Katherine Goldstein  is an independent journalist and the creator of The Double Shift, a podcast, newsletter and community.

11,Starbucks Workers In Seattle Vote To Form Union,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost The campaign to unionize Starbucks stores has made headway in the coffee chain’s hometown, with the union winning an election at a store in Seattle on Tuesday. Workers at a store in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood voted unanimously to join the union Workers United, which has been organizing baristas around the country since last year. The 9-0 election victory for the campaign brings the total number of union Starbucks stores to seven, including five in New York and one in Arizona. Workers have filed petitions for union elections at more than 140 other stores in 27 states, making it likely their ranks will grow in the coming weeks. So far, the union has lost just one election out of eight. Rachel Ybarra, a barista at the Seattle shop, said following the vote count that a resounding victory in the company’s backyard could embolden workers elsewhere to try to form a union. “I know this is going to make other stores more confident to contact us,” Ybarra said. A Starbucks spokesperson said in an email that “we still believe in Starbucks’ direct relationship with our partners, but will continue to respect the [legal] process.” The union campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has been organizing store by store around the country, starting with the Buffalo area of New York. Around 13 workers will be part of the bargaining unit at the Seattle store, though other locations number around three dozen. “I know this is going to make other stores more confident to contact us.” Starbucks has roughly 9,000 company-owned stores in the U.S., all of which were non-union until last year. The company has opposed the union campaign, with managers holding meetings with workers urging them to vote “no.” The union has accused Starbucks of a litany of unfair labor practices, alleging the company has retaliated against union organizers. The National Labor Relations Board, which referees collective bargaining in the private sector, found merit in the union’s claims in Arizona, saying Starbucks singled out a pair of pro-union workers, one of whom lost her job. Starbucks has denied the allegations. Starbucks announced last week that its longtime leader, Howard Schultz, would be returning atop the company to replace outgoing chief executive Kevin Johnson. Schultz will take over at a critical juncture in the unionization effort. “We have to take a hard look at how we are doing as a company, and as a community of partners,” he said in a message to Starbucks employees last week. Schultz has dealt with unions at Starbucks in the past. Several of the chain’s original stores and its roastery in the Seattle area were represented by a union in the 1980s. The union was eventually decertified and no longer represented those workers by the early 1990s, a development that Schultz wrote about with approval in a memoir. Under Schultz’s helm, the company later successfully fended off an organizing effort by the Industrial Workers of the World that began in the early 2000s. But the current campaign has already notched a historic string of victories, and baristas promise there are more to come. Sydney Durkin, a worker at the newly unionized Seattle store, warned Tuesday that Schultz would be fighting a “losing battle” if he hopes to slow the organizing campaign. “If he’s going to come in expecting his old tactics to work, he’s going to find a whole new reality,” Durkin said.

12,Amazon Fined For ‘Knowingly Putting Workers At Risk’ With Productivity Quotas,business," Labor Reporter, HuffPost Workplace safety officials in Washington state have hit Amazon with a $60,000 fine for “knowingly putting workers at risk” at its massive warehouse in Kent. Investigators with the state’s Department of Labor and Industries attributed the dangers in part to Amazon’s well-known productivity quotas. Working in one of the retailer’s fulfillment centers requires a number of repetitive motions, such as bending, lifting and twisting, at “such a fast pace that it increases the risk of injury,” the agency said in a statement. Officials said they classified the violation as “willful” — a more serious category than typical citations — because they had already cited Seattle-based Amazon for similar problems at three facilities. Ergonomists with the state evaluated a dozen work processes inside the Kent facility and found “serious” hazards in 10 of them. “The company has not yet made necessary changes to improve workplace safety and has consistently denied the association between pace of work and injury rates,” the agency said. Insider was first to report on the citation. One of the ergonomists who inspected the facility told the outlet that they had tried to calculate the risk of injury but Amazon’s productivity rates “broke the model.” The fine may seem paltry for a retail giant that had $14.3 billion in profits last quarter, but workplace safety penalties in the U.S. tend to be small by statute. In Washington state, the penalty for a citation like the one issued against Amazon usually tops out at $70,000, though it can be greater under special circumstances. Amazon said in a statement that it plans to appeal the fine: “We strongly disagree with [the agency’s] claims and don’t believe they are supported by the facts.” The company also appealed the three other citations issued by the state. The agency that issued the fines is a state equivalent of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “The company’s merciless focus on volume and work pace, coupled with constant surveillance of its employees, directly puts workers’ health and safety at risk.” Washington state said Amazon has two months to submit a plan explaining how it will address the safety issues. The citation offers 11 recommendations to Amazon, including using special equipment to reduce “awkward lifting,” and rotating workers among job tasks “to reduce overloading individual employees.” Amazon workers are closely monitored for their work productivity as they pick, pack and ship out orders to customers. The retailer has insisted that its expectations are safe, but many workers and advocacy groups have complained that the pressure to meet quotas under threat of termination can lead to injury and burnout. The Strategic Organizing Center, a union coalition that has analyzed Amazon injury data in the past, said the citation showed that the company was under “sharper scrutiny.” “The company’s merciless focus on volume and work pace, coupled with constant surveillance of its employees, directly puts workers’ health and safety at risk,” Eric Frumin, the group’s health and safety director, said in a statement. A 2020 investigation by Reveal found that Amazon had concealed higher-than-publicly-known injury rates. The retailer has taken heat for its “time off task” policy that dings workers for time spent away from the workstation, and it announced last year that it would rework the metric to be less punitive. Last year, California implemented a new law taking aim at Amazon’s productivity quotas, forbidding companies from implementing work rates that prevent workers from using the bathroom. The bill applies to all large warehouses in the state, but its sponsor singled out the world’s largest online retailer by name when the governor signed it. Union supporters in Alabama have cited the work pace as one reason they want to bargain collectively with Amazon. The company defeated a union drive at its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse last year, but labor officials later determined that Amazon had interfered in the election and broken the law. A do-over election is currently underway. This post has been updated with comment from Amazon. Labor Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Koch Industries To Stay In Russia Defying Zelenskyy's Calls For Isolation,business," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Koch Industries, Inc., led by billionaire conservative donor Charles Koch, will stay in Russia, defying calls for American companies to exit the country, according to a statement published on its website Wednesday. More than 400 companies have either withdrawn, suspended or scaled back their operations in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine, a list compiled by Yale’s School of Management shows. Guardian Industries, owned by Koch Industries, employs 600 people across two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia. Koch also has an additional 15 employees in the country outside of Guardian Industries. “While Guardian’s business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them,” Dave Robertson, president and COO of Koch Industries, said in the statement. Robertson criticized Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, which have killed civilians and led over 3.1 million people to flee their homes, according to data published by the United Nations. “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” he said. “It violates our company’s values and principles.” Still, the company is choosing to maintain its presence in the country and follow Russian rules, arguing that leaving would harm its employees. “Koch companies are complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate,” Robertson said. In a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged lawmakers to pressure companies in their states to cut business ties with Russia. “All American companies must leave Russia from their market ... immediately because it is flooded with our blood,” Zelenskyy said. “Peace is more important than income, and we have to defend this principle in the whole world.” Ukrainian President Zelenskyy calls on members of U.S. Congress to issue further action against Russian politicians, apply pressure on companies to exit Russia.""All American companies must leave Russia...immediately because it is flooded with our blood."" https://t.co/YTjDsZBM0G pic.twitter.com/9PkcKl8W84 Koch Industries, Inc., which employs over 120,000 people in more than 50 countries, has annual revenues of $115 billion, according to Forbes. Charles Koch, the company’s 86-year-old CEO, threw his money behind the tea party movement after Barack Obama’s election victory in 2008. But he has said he regrets the partisanship he has come to be known for over the years. “Boy, did we screw up! What a mess!” he wrote in his book “Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World,” published in November 2020. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in November 2020, following the presidential election, he did not reveal which candidate he supported. Still, after the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Koch Industries was the fourth-largest donor bankrolling Republican lawmakers who falsely argued that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election, according to OpenSecrets, the nonprofit tracking money in U.S. politics. But Koch himself said Republicans should certify Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Koch is ranked No. 27 on Forbes’ World’s Billionaires List for 2021. Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"
